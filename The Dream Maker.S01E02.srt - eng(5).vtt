What makes you think

00:01:40.946 --> 00:01:43.305
the 'monkeys' will follow you?

00:01:43.825 --> 00:01:45.545
On the night of the county meeting,

00:01:45.825 --> 00:01:47.032
'monkeys' of Jiangku District

00:01:47.146 --> 00:01:48.105
(Cai Gang, Li Qiuping)
heard the news

00:01:48.385 --> 00:01:50.185
and held a meeting with me.

00:01:51.346 --> 00:01:52.745
They all want to leave with me.

00:01:53.105 --> 00:01:53.825
Ms. Zheng is here!

00:01:54.025 --> 00:01:55.066
The Secretary is here!

00:01:55.305 --> 00:01:55.805
(Zheng Family Ancestral Hall)
He is here.

00:01:57.346 --> 00:01:58.786
Ms. Zheng.

00:01:58.825 --> 00:01:59.545
Ms. Zheng is here!

00:02:00.626 --> 00:02:01.185
Ms. Zheng!

00:02:01.305 --> 00:02:02.265
Ms. Zheng came!

00:02:02.465 --> 00:02:03.626
The Secretary is here!

00:02:03.946 --> 00:02:04.986
Ms. Zheng is here!

00:02:05.025 --> 00:02:06.305
The Secretary's here!

00:02:07.366 --> 00:02:07.866
Is it true

00:02:07.866 --> 00:02:09.186
about building a city?

00:02:09.265 --> 00:02:10.265
We're getting anxious.

00:02:10.265 --> 00:02:11.705
- Is it true?
- What's the rush?

00:02:11.746 --> 00:02:13.186
Mr. Zheng will speak in public.

00:02:13.865 --> 00:02:14.665
You're the loudest.

00:02:15.226 --> 00:02:17.265
I haven't eaten.
I'll be even louder after I eat.

00:02:17.506 --> 00:02:18.186
Hold my bag.

00:02:18.385 --> 00:02:18.906
Okay.

00:02:20.066 --> 00:02:21.026
Attention, guys.

00:02:28.825 --> 00:02:30.026
The county committee

00:02:31.665 --> 00:02:32.705
has decided

00:02:33.385 --> 00:02:35.026
to rebuild Yuehai into a city.

00:02:36.665 --> 00:02:37.425
I knew it.

00:02:37.746 --> 00:02:38.585
Yuehai!

00:02:38.585 --> 00:02:39.346
True information.

00:02:39.585 --> 00:02:40.825
My information is true!

00:02:42.186 --> 00:02:43.825
Once you move to Yuehai,

00:02:45.226 --> 00:02:46.626
you'll all get urban residency.

00:02:48.906 --> 00:02:49.665
All of you

00:02:50.466 --> 00:02:51.746
will become city dwellers.

00:02:52.186 --> 00:02:54.066
Better days are just around the corner.

00:02:54.985 --> 00:02:57.026
Mr. Zheng, let me confirm this.

00:02:57.425 --> 00:02:58.825
So, you mean

00:02:59.306 --> 00:03:00.545
we'll soon be city people?

00:03:01.585 --> 00:03:03.145
Really? City dwellers?

00:03:03.145 --> 00:03:03.645
True.

00:03:04.425 --> 00:03:05.425
I, Zheng Decheng,

00:03:06.066 --> 00:03:07.786
never make baseless claims.

00:03:08.145 --> 00:03:09.226
This is based

00:03:10.346 --> 00:03:13.425
on this year's No.1 Central Document

00:03:13.825 --> 00:03:14.786
and the People's Daily.

00:03:15.226 --> 00:03:16.346
I'm pretty sure.

00:03:16.746 --> 00:03:17.246
Mr. Zheng,

00:03:17.545 --> 00:03:19.545
what requirements do we need
to go there?

00:03:20.145 --> 00:03:20.786
Yes, exactly.

00:03:20.786 --> 00:03:21.705
Exactly.

00:03:21.705 --> 00:03:22.585
What requirements?

00:03:23.026 --> 00:03:23.985
Let me think.

00:03:25.665 --> 00:03:26.346
Well,

00:03:27.265 --> 00:03:27.825
first,

00:03:29.186 --> 00:03:29.825
you need land.

00:03:31.306 --> 00:03:33.385
Second, you need to build a house.

00:03:35.626 --> 00:03:36.466
What about the cost?

00:03:36.985 --> 00:03:39.425
I estimate
around 10,000 should cover it.

00:03:39.865 --> 00:03:40.705
That's so cheap!

00:03:41.425 --> 00:03:41.985
So cheap!

00:03:42.026 --> 00:03:42.526
Wait.

00:03:43.746 --> 00:03:44.705
You're being naive.

00:03:45.906 --> 00:03:46.626
Why do you think

00:03:46.746 --> 00:03:48.226
the 'monkeys' will go to Yuehai?

00:03:49.105 --> 00:03:51.705
I'm Zheng Decheng. They trust me.

00:03:53.466 --> 00:03:54.265
This is alright.

00:03:54.865 --> 00:03:55.665
Of course.

00:03:55.665 --> 00:03:56.306
It's no problem.

00:03:56.786 --> 00:03:57.626
You're single,

00:03:58.026 --> 00:03:59.585
ten thousand buys your urban residency.

00:03:59.665 --> 00:04:00.506
Your family is big.

00:04:00.705 --> 00:04:01.506
Just borrow money.

00:04:01.746 --> 00:04:03.186
This is a great opportunity.

00:04:03.306 --> 00:04:04.506
That will cost more.

00:04:04.506 --> 00:04:05.705
You can borrow money!

00:04:05.865 --> 00:04:06.466
Golden chance!

00:04:06.466 --> 00:04:07.466
One more thing,

00:04:10.665 --> 00:04:12.066
I'll be the Secretary of Yuehai.

00:04:13.026 --> 00:04:14.226
Be a Secretary again?

00:04:14.265 --> 00:04:15.186
Great, Mr. Zheng!

00:04:15.346 --> 00:04:15.846
Wonderful!

00:04:18.666 --> 00:04:19.186
Of course,

00:04:20.225 --> 00:04:23.225
it's not 100 percent confirmed yet.

00:04:23.785 --> 00:04:25.785
County leadership is discussing it.

00:04:26.785 --> 00:04:29.345
But I believe it's practically settled.

00:04:29.866 --> 00:04:33.145
Considering land, housing,
urban residency, and you,

00:04:33.265 --> 00:04:34.106
we must go!

00:04:34.385 --> 00:04:35.446
Yes, Mr. Zheng!

00:04:35.666 --> 00:04:38.626
With you there,
we're all reassured, right?

00:04:38.626 --> 00:04:39.225
Yes!

00:04:39.946 --> 00:04:40.986
Aren't you all going?

00:04:41.306 --> 00:04:42.585
As long as we follow Mr. Zheng,

00:04:42.746 --> 00:04:44.626
we'll surely have a better life.

00:04:44.666 --> 00:04:45.186
True!

00:05:01.225 --> 00:05:02.186
(Pingchuan Yuehai's Secretary Election)
What's he grinning about?

00:05:02.265 --> 00:05:02.986
I don't know.

00:05:03.122 --> 00:05:05.688
(Cai Gang, Li Qiuping)

00:05:07.225 --> 00:05:08.746
The 'monkeys' all believe

00:05:09.186 --> 00:05:10.905
I'll definitely
be the Secretary of Yuehai.

00:05:11.145 --> 00:05:11.905
Leaders,

00:05:12.465 --> 00:05:14.306
please don't make me lose face.

00:05:16.225 --> 00:05:17.225
Incredibly arrogant!

00:05:17.225 --> 00:05:19.066
Zheng Decheng is probably overconfident.

00:05:24.345 --> 00:05:25.225
How shameless!

00:05:30.465 --> 00:05:31.145
Zheng Decheng.

00:05:33.618 --> 00:05:35.192
(Liu Guangfa, Guan Yiming,
Zhao Dongsheng, Xia Changyou, Yan Zhenming)

00:05:36.905 --> 00:05:37.546
Let me ask you.

00:05:38.546 --> 00:05:40.066
If 50,000 people move into the city,

00:05:40.746 --> 00:05:42.106
how will they make a living

00:05:42.946 --> 00:05:43.705
and survive?

00:05:44.385 --> 00:05:45.866
Have you considered these issues?

00:05:46.585 --> 00:05:47.225
Mr. Zhao,

00:05:47.426 --> 00:05:48.666
we don't need to think

00:05:48.825 --> 00:05:50.546
about how they make a living

00:05:50.705 --> 00:05:51.866
and support their families.

00:05:52.506 --> 00:05:55.106
Those 'monkeys' are all capable.

00:05:55.345 --> 00:05:57.705
We only need to focus on one thing:

00:06:00.705 --> 00:06:01.306
guidance.

00:06:01.825 --> 00:06:04.746
Guide them to become the backbone
of Yuehai's economy.

00:06:06.785 --> 00:06:08.666
This does require government guidance.

00:06:14.825 --> 00:06:16.905
Do any of you have further questions?

00:06:17.705 --> 00:06:19.666
Feel free to ask anything.

00:06:19.905 --> 00:06:21.465
I'll answer whatever you ask.

00:06:23.506 --> 00:06:26.145
Alright, invite Cai Gang
and Li Qiuping to the stage.

00:06:27.905 --> 00:06:30.986
Cai Gang and Li Qiuping,
please come to the stage.

00:06:36.705 --> 00:06:40.666
During today's election,
we've been deeply moved

00:06:41.426 --> 00:06:42.186
and inspired.

00:06:43.106 --> 00:06:44.905
You've answered all questions earnestly,

00:06:45.306 --> 00:06:48.746
providing innovative solutions
in such a short time.

00:06:49.585 --> 00:06:50.345
Here's my thought.

00:06:50.385 --> 00:06:53.106
I'd like to ask each of you
one final question.

00:06:53.905 --> 00:06:56.066
Give me one reason each

00:06:57.106 --> 00:06:59.946
why you should be Yuehai's Secretary.

00:07:00.506 --> 00:07:02.705
Isn't money what Yuehai lacks most?

00:07:02.785 --> 00:07:04.186
I can bring in the 'monkeys'.

00:07:04.186 --> 00:07:05.306
I can secure funding.

00:07:10.265 --> 00:07:11.265
Quite straightforward.

00:07:11.666 --> 00:07:12.785
Li, you go next.

00:07:13.666 --> 00:07:16.785
Sir, I'm very young,
which is my advantage.

00:07:21.306 --> 00:07:22.225
That's a valid reason.

00:07:22.225 --> 00:07:23.546
Good for you.

00:07:24.186 --> 00:07:26.546
Being young means
I act without hesitation.

00:07:26.905 --> 00:07:30.265
Moreover,
I know every inch of Yuehai's land.

00:07:30.626 --> 00:07:33.066
My planning map proves everything.

00:07:34.345 --> 00:07:34.845
Good.

00:07:37.465 --> 00:07:39.186
Zheng Decheng, be serious.

00:07:44.746 --> 00:07:45.345
Mr. Zhao,

00:07:46.025 --> 00:07:47.506
based on today's presentations,

00:07:47.746 --> 00:07:49.506
I'd like to share some personal ideas.

00:07:49.986 --> 00:07:50.486
Go ahead.

00:07:51.025 --> 00:07:51.626
First,

00:07:52.825 --> 00:07:55.186
we shouldn't worship foreign approaches.

00:07:55.746 --> 00:07:58.506
Foreign methods don't suit Pingchuan.

00:07:59.366 --> 00:08:01.106
Second, I'm addressing your question.

00:08:01.905 --> 00:08:03.785
Yuehai's development mustn't be rushed.

00:08:04.265 --> 00:08:05.905
We need realistic development goals.

00:08:06.426 --> 00:08:08.905
Throwing out numbers
like 50,000 people is irresponsible.

00:08:10.265 --> 00:08:10.866
Third,

00:08:11.585 --> 00:08:13.546
stability is paramount.

00:08:14.186 --> 00:08:16.345
In steadily advancing development,

00:08:16.825 --> 00:08:18.426
I have substantial experience.

00:08:19.066 --> 00:08:20.186
As a government body,

00:08:20.465 --> 00:08:22.585
we must prioritize stability,

00:08:23.106 --> 00:08:24.306
avoid frequent policy changes,

00:08:24.946 --> 00:08:26.265
refrain from arbitrary decisions,

00:08:26.666 --> 00:08:28.186
and never violate central directives.

00:08:28.546 --> 00:08:29.225
Mr. Cai,

00:08:30.025 --> 00:08:32.985
your "stability"
sounds like doing nothing.

00:08:33.865 --> 00:08:36.585
Decheng, inaction beats reckless action.

00:08:37.306 --> 00:08:38.745
Your rash actions in Jinshan

00:08:39.026 --> 00:08:40.546
caused 10,000 yuan in losses.

00:08:40.786 --> 00:08:41.465
- I...
- Wait.

00:08:42.146 --> 00:08:43.906
Mr. Cai, explain this.

00:08:44.266 --> 00:08:46.266
What caused the loss?

00:08:46.426 --> 00:08:47.906
Sir,

00:08:48.186 --> 00:08:48.946
I know about this.

00:08:49.345 --> 00:08:52.546
Zheng Decheng led villagers
in Jinshan to raise turtles.

00:08:52.705 --> 00:08:53.786
During startup,

00:08:53.825 --> 00:08:57.105
he borrowed 10,000 yuan
from the credit union in the town's name

00:08:57.345 --> 00:08:58.146
to buy hatchlings.

00:08:58.465 --> 00:09:01.585
But unfortunately, all hatchlings died.

00:09:02.426 --> 00:09:03.705
Why wasn't I informed?

00:09:04.266 --> 00:09:06.066
You were at the Party School then.

00:09:06.386 --> 00:09:08.745
The former Secretary handled it.

00:09:09.465 --> 00:09:11.666
He firmly opposed disciplinary action,

00:09:11.965 --> 00:09:14.026
so Zheng Decheng
was held responsible for the loss.

00:09:14.745 --> 00:09:16.426
He borrowed money

00:09:16.705 --> 00:09:17.985
and paid 2,000 upfront,

00:09:18.146 --> 00:09:20.705
with 50 yuan docked monthly
from his salary

00:09:20.946 --> 00:09:21.745
for eight years.

00:09:23.345 --> 00:09:24.026
I heard

00:09:24.345 --> 00:09:25.825
that after villagers learned

00:09:25.946 --> 00:09:28.105
about his repayments,

00:09:28.225 --> 00:09:29.666
they pooled money

00:09:29.985 --> 00:09:31.386
to repay Zheng Decheng's debt.

00:09:31.666 --> 00:09:34.426
But Zheng Decheng firmly refused
to accept their money.

00:09:39.625 --> 00:09:41.745
Leaders, I wish to go to Yuehai.

00:09:42.026 --> 00:09:43.985
That's entirely separate
from the past mistakes.

00:09:44.585 --> 00:09:45.505
I guarantee

00:09:45.745 --> 00:09:47.865
that I will repay all my previous debts.

00:09:48.146 --> 00:09:50.186
If I can't, my son will continue paying

00:09:50.666 --> 00:09:51.585
until my debt is clear.

00:09:52.266 --> 00:09:52.985
Zheng Decheng,

00:09:53.786 --> 00:09:56.105
stop pretending to be selfless.

00:09:56.426 --> 00:09:58.386
Do you really have no personal motives?

00:09:59.266 --> 00:10:00.666
Taking so many 'monkeys' to Yuehai,

00:10:00.666 --> 00:10:02.745
are you trying
to become some local emperor?

00:10:03.345 --> 00:10:05.146
Mr. Cai, what do you mean by that?

00:10:05.426 --> 00:10:06.505
Watch your words.

00:10:06.906 --> 00:10:08.825
They volunteered
to go to Yuehai with me!

00:10:09.146 --> 00:10:09.646
Enough,

00:10:10.745 --> 00:10:12.026
calm down.

00:10:12.306 --> 00:10:14.786
Having a debate is good.

00:10:14.825 --> 00:10:16.146
Let's put it all on the table.

00:10:16.825 --> 00:10:18.146
Now, let's put it to a vote.

00:10:19.386 --> 00:10:19.886
Okay.

00:10:21.585 --> 00:10:22.345
Cai Gang.

00:10:25.946 --> 00:10:26.946
Cai Gang.

00:10:29.146 --> 00:10:30.186
Zheng Decheng.

00:10:32.666 --> 00:10:33.906
Zheng Decheng.

00:10:37.906 --> 00:10:38.786
Cai, how did it go?

00:10:38.786 --> 00:10:39.906
(Auditorium)
He is cunning,

00:10:40.186 --> 00:10:41.825
making the 'monkeys'
pay to build Yuehai.

00:10:41.825 --> 00:10:42.666
Unbelievable!

00:10:43.386 --> 00:10:43.886
Then,

00:10:44.026 --> 00:10:44.786
- any chance?
- Go home.

00:10:45.105 --> 00:10:46.200
What do you mean?

00:10:46.200 --> 00:10:47.096
Wait for me.

00:10:47.096 --> 00:10:48.686
Decheng, how is it going?

00:10:50.666 --> 00:10:52.386
Come on, just tell me about it.

00:10:54.985 --> 00:10:55.745
I won, I think.

00:10:56.105 --> 00:10:57.026
Really? That's great!

00:11:15.306 --> 00:11:15.946
It's over?

00:11:17.985 --> 00:11:19.386
Where are we going? You decide.

Your idea to bring the 'monkeys'
to build Yuehai is even more impressive.

That's way too much!

00:14:37.146 --> 00:14:39.066

Mr. Zheng,

00:14:45.546 --> 00:14:46.985
instead of getting my blueprint,

00:14:47.345 --> 00:14:50.026
why not try asking Mr. Zhao
for household registration approval?

00:14:50.585 --> 00:14:51.186
What?

00:14:51.786 --> 00:14:54.985
After all, they care more
about their household registration,

00:14:55.345 --> 00:14:55.946
don't they?

00:14:57.705 --> 00:14:58.666

00:14:58.906 --> 00:15:00.186

00:15:00.386 --> 00:15:01.705

00:17:35.826 --> 00:17:38.586
(Its rider wore silver armor
over white robes,)

00:17:38.586 --> 00:17:41.186
(brandishing a spear as he shouted.)

00:17:41.426 --> 00:17:44.346
(Don't be afraid.)

00:17:44.426 --> 00:17:45.985
(I'll protect you.)

00:17:46.386 --> 00:17:50.346
(Yue Fei fought
against the foreign generals.)

00:17:52.626 --> 00:17:55.465
Mr. Shen, it's a bit crowded.

00:17:56.265 --> 00:17:57.025
Hold on tight!

00:17:59.586 --> 00:18:02.386
We need to take a boat to your factory?

00:18:03.626 --> 00:18:05.826
Not far! Once we cross the river,
we're almost there!

00:18:06.545 --> 00:18:07.106
Alright.

00:18:07.186 --> 00:18:07.946
Let me help.

00:18:07.946 --> 00:18:09.065
No, I'll hold it myself!

00:18:10.785 --> 00:18:11.384
Sorry.

00:18:11.384 --> 00:18:12.426
Move a little bit.

00:18:12.745 --> 00:18:13.245
Okay.

00:18:36.545 --> 00:18:37.186
Mr. Shen.

00:18:38.186 --> 00:18:38.785
Sit tight!

00:18:41.225 --> 00:18:42.025
Let me tell you,

00:18:42.666 --> 00:18:43.906
Chunmei Printery

00:18:44.386 --> 00:18:48.106
is the perfect union
of Xie Chunlai and Gao Xuemei!

00:18:48.386 --> 00:18:48.886
Sure.

00:18:49.065 --> 00:18:51.386
As founders,
we personally came to welcome you.

00:18:51.386 --> 00:18:51.886
True!

00:18:51.946 --> 00:18:52.866
I'm honored.

00:18:53.025 --> 00:18:54.906
My surname is Xie,

00:18:54.906 --> 00:18:56.426
which is also pronounced as Jie.

00:18:56.866 --> 00:18:57.545
Yes, exactly!

00:19:00.826 --> 00:19:02.346
To welcome you,

00:19:02.745 --> 00:19:03.826
yesterday, my wife

00:19:03.985 --> 00:19:05.426
prepared cooking ingredients.

00:19:05.545 --> 00:19:06.065
Yes!

00:19:06.346 --> 00:19:08.666
Two giant turtles
and two local chickens!

00:19:08.946 --> 00:19:11.946
They're already cooked well,
just waiting for you!

00:19:13.785 --> 00:19:14.465
Sit tight!

00:19:15.666 --> 00:19:16.166
Whoa!

00:19:16.386 --> 00:19:18.785
Ms. Gao, can you tell me exactly

00:19:18.826 --> 00:19:20.545
how far your factory is anyway?

00:19:20.785 --> 00:19:23.265
Not too far. Just over an hour's drive.

00:19:23.305 --> 00:19:23.805
What?

00:19:23.946 --> 00:19:26.146
In less than 50 minutes,
and we'll be there!

00:19:27.386 --> 00:19:28.626
That's almost an hour!

00:19:30.906 --> 00:19:31.705
It's so remote!

00:19:31.745 --> 00:19:33.426
Why didn't you tell me beforehand?

00:19:33.666 --> 00:19:34.985
A good thing takes time.

00:19:35.045 --> 00:19:35.545
Right.

00:19:35.545 --> 00:19:36.826
A good factory's worth the trip.

00:19:36.826 --> 00:19:37.386
Exactly!

00:19:37.386 --> 00:19:41.946
We cover transportation, meals,
and accommodation.

00:19:42.626 --> 00:19:44.505
The key is the top-notch quality.

00:19:44.705 --> 00:19:45.225
True.

00:19:45.225 --> 00:19:46.106
You'll find out later.

00:19:46.705 --> 00:19:47.985
Look at the view!

00:19:48.346 --> 00:19:49.146
Take a look.

00:19:49.305 --> 00:19:51.106
This is definitely the place
for big deals!

00:19:51.106 --> 00:19:51.785
Yes!

00:19:51.946 --> 00:19:53.426
Good feng shui breeds entrepreneurs!

00:19:53.426 --> 00:19:55.586
This place is remote,

00:19:55.985 --> 00:19:56.946
but it's perfectly safe.

00:19:57.186 --> 00:19:57.686
Yes.

00:19:57.826 --> 00:19:59.346
No bandits on the road.

00:19:59.565 --> 00:20:00.065
Right.

00:20:00.065 --> 00:20:01.186
No robbers or murderers.

00:20:01.705 --> 00:20:03.505
Just ignore those few scattered graves.

00:20:03.545 --> 00:20:04.305
Out of sight,

00:20:04.985 --> 00:20:05.866
out of mind.

00:20:05.866 --> 00:20:07.545
- Relax.
- No one could hide there anyway.

00:20:07.985 --> 00:20:08.745
- No one could.
- No hiding spots.

00:20:08.785 --> 00:20:10.265
Just enjoy the view!

00:20:10.705 --> 00:20:11.426
Appreciate it!

00:20:14.225 --> 00:20:15.065
Beautiful.

00:20:22.265 --> 00:20:25.745
Stop! Stop right away!

00:20:29.826 --> 00:20:30.326
What?

00:20:30.545 --> 00:20:31.045
Well,

00:20:31.346 --> 00:20:32.666
wh-what's wrong?

00:20:33.505 --> 00:20:34.005
You...

00:20:36.906 --> 00:20:37.626
I need to pee.

00:20:39.025 --> 00:20:39.745
Just find a place.

00:20:39.826 --> 00:20:40.326
Go ahead!

00:20:40.465 --> 00:20:40.965
Go.

00:20:41.465 --> 00:20:42.106
I'll wait.

00:20:42.906 --> 00:20:43.545
I won't watch.

00:20:43.985 --> 00:20:44.666
I hold your bag?

00:20:44.826 --> 00:20:45.545
No! No need!

00:20:46.186 --> 00:20:46.686
Okay.

00:20:46.705 --> 00:20:47.985
Mr. Shen, feel free!

00:20:51.186 --> 00:20:51.985
His bladder jolted.

00:20:59.586 --> 00:21:00.086
What?

00:21:00.426 --> 00:21:01.386
Where is he going?

00:21:01.426 --> 00:21:02.785
- What?
- We're not looking!

00:21:08.065 --> 00:21:08.946
Mr. Shen!

00:21:10.586 --> 00:21:11.705
I'm not going!

00:21:13.426 --> 00:21:15.146
I won't go with you.

00:21:20.626 --> 00:21:21.505
He ran off!

00:21:22.265 --> 00:21:23.384
He hates a long trip.

00:21:23.785 --> 00:21:24.586
I know!

00:21:24.745 --> 00:21:26.225
I saw it! No need to explain!

00:21:26.505 --> 00:21:27.005
My fault?

00:21:27.025 --> 00:21:27.626
Yes!

00:21:27.906 --> 00:21:29.505
It's all your fault!

00:21:29.785 --> 00:21:32.465
You said one hour, which scared him off.

00:21:32.705 --> 00:21:34.086
Didn't you say anything?

00:21:34.106 --> 00:21:34.826
Didn't you?

00:21:35.146 --> 00:21:36.626
Bandits on the road?

00:21:36.985 --> 00:21:39.065
I was comforting him!
Trying to ease his fears!

00:21:39.305 --> 00:21:40.025
Are you kidding?

00:21:40.305 --> 00:21:41.265
Your comfort scared him.

00:21:41.265 --> 00:21:42.465
- Don't be silly.
- You butted in!

00:21:42.666 --> 00:21:44.465
Talking about graves.

00:21:44.505 --> 00:21:45.906
Look, you're dressed like a spook!

00:21:46.106 --> 00:21:46.785
So he was scared!

00:21:47.906 --> 00:21:48.985
Shut up.

00:21:49.785 --> 00:21:50.626
Shut up!

00:21:51.586 --> 00:21:54.265
We've lost three deals this month.

00:21:57.065 --> 00:22:00.305
My life is so bitter!

00:22:01.225 --> 00:22:03.225
I'm exhausted!

00:22:03.906 --> 00:22:04.996
I brought him here

00:22:05.560 --> 00:22:08.985
by bus, boat, and motorbike.

00:22:09.465 --> 00:22:11.826
Mr. Shen, you big liar!

00:22:12.346 --> 00:22:13.426
You fraud!

00:22:13.666 --> 00:22:15.305
You double-crossed me!

00:22:15.465 --> 00:22:17.265
You liar!

00:22:17.745 --> 00:22:19.545
You deceived me!

00:22:19.985 --> 00:22:22.186
You broke my wife's trust!

00:22:22.505 --> 00:22:24.505
A pretty lady wanted
to do business with you,

00:22:24.745 --> 00:22:25.626
but you tricked her!

00:22:27.946 --> 00:22:29.305
Princess, you're stunning!

00:22:30.346 --> 00:22:32.106
You'll regret this!

00:22:32.826 --> 00:22:34.106
May your bike chain

00:22:34.505 --> 00:22:36.426
snap!

00:22:36.906 --> 00:22:38.545
May you burn out your kettles

00:22:38.866 --> 00:22:40.545
and blast yourself with your own farts!

00:22:44.666 --> 00:22:45.906
I'm here for you.

00:22:46.485 --> 00:22:47.985
Is my hairstyle messy?

00:22:48.025 --> 00:22:48.586
Let me see.

00:22:48.705 --> 00:22:50.305
I paid for it yesterday.

00:22:50.305 --> 00:22:51.906
Let me look. It's perfect.

00:22:54.225 --> 00:22:55.065
Your tears.

00:22:56.106 --> 00:22:56.946
All good.

00:22:57.065 --> 00:22:57.666
It's all good?

00:22:59.406 --> 00:22:59.906
He left.

00:22:59.906 --> 00:23:01.106
What food did you make?

00:23:01.745 --> 00:23:02.505
Big turtles.

00:23:02.626 --> 00:23:03.545
Go back and eat them.

00:23:14.906 --> 00:23:17.626
Sorry! I was in a hurry
and crashed into your door.

00:23:18.946 --> 00:23:20.505
So careless. The door's expensive.

00:23:20.626 --> 00:23:21.505
I just replaced this.

00:23:21.705 --> 00:23:22.785
That's not the point.

00:23:22.906 --> 00:23:23.545
I'll pay for it.

00:23:25.265 --> 00:23:26.626
I got beaten up.

00:23:28.505 --> 00:23:29.666
What happened?

00:23:30.426 --> 00:23:31.545
That's not the point either.

00:23:31.745 --> 00:23:33.906
Mr. Zheng, I need to ask you one thing.

00:23:34.186 --> 00:23:35.626
Are you the Secretary of Yuehai?

00:23:38.225 --> 00:23:39.265
Of course I am.

00:23:39.866 --> 00:23:41.265
The procedure takes time.

00:23:41.666 --> 00:23:43.186
In this case, I know what to do.

00:23:43.666 --> 00:23:45.505
Otherwise,
they'll think I'm lying to them.

00:23:46.065 --> 00:23:47.545
Who thinks you're tricking them?

00:23:48.545 --> 00:23:49.965
Look, Mr. Zheng.

00:23:50.906 --> 00:23:52.225
We spontaneously made a register.

00:23:52.426 --> 00:23:54.705
All who want to go
to Yuehai wrote their names on it.

00:23:54.705 --> 00:23:56.280
(Registration)

00:23:57.106 --> 00:23:58.326
- Voluntarily?
- Sure.

00:23:58.626 --> 00:23:59.346
Absolutely.

00:23:59.946 --> 00:24:00.946
Right after your speech,

00:24:01.146 --> 00:24:02.545
I talked to lots of 'monkeys'.

00:24:03.146 --> 00:24:05.186
They heard
you're the Secretary of Yuehai,

00:24:05.225 --> 00:24:06.426
so they're willing to go.

00:24:06.626 --> 00:24:07.866
But right after registering,

00:24:07.906 --> 00:24:09.586
Fatty came and said

00:24:09.785 --> 00:24:10.946
about a rumor that you are

00:24:11.065 --> 00:24:12.265
no longer Secretary of Yuehai.

00:24:12.505 --> 00:24:13.826
A guy beat you.

00:24:14.025 --> 00:24:15.225
Gang Cai? Or Cai...

00:24:16.785 --> 00:24:17.626
That's nonsense!

00:24:18.025 --> 00:24:19.505
How could I not be the Secretary?

00:24:19.705 --> 00:24:20.205
Yes.

00:24:20.426 --> 00:24:21.545
You don't even believe me?

00:24:21.626 --> 00:24:22.265
I believe you.

00:24:22.465 --> 00:24:23.545
Can't you even handle this?

00:24:23.906 --> 00:24:24.826
Turn around right now

00:24:25.065 --> 00:24:25.705
and go tell them

00:24:26.025 --> 00:24:27.106
that I'm the Secretary.

00:24:27.225 --> 00:24:27.946
Mr. Zheng!

00:24:27.985 --> 00:24:29.586
I can't do this alone.

00:24:29.826 --> 00:24:30.745
You have to go with me.

00:24:30.946 --> 00:24:31.985
Put some medicine on.

00:24:32.065 --> 00:24:33.586
They're fighting, Mr. Zheng!

00:24:34.025 --> 00:24:34.545
I won't go.

00:24:34.545 --> 00:24:35.465
Mr. Zheng, please.

00:24:35.666 --> 00:24:36.166
- Stop.
- Mr. Zheng.

00:24:36.225 --> 00:24:37.705
If you don't, I'll just live here.

00:24:37.765 --> 00:24:39.225
Why are you being so shameless?

00:24:39.386 --> 00:24:40.305
I'm this shameless.

00:24:40.505 --> 00:24:41.225
If you don't go,

00:24:41.225 --> 00:24:43.106
I'll live here and eat your food.

00:24:43.326 --> 00:24:45.386
Mr. Zheng, please, help me out, okay?

00:24:45.586 --> 00:24:47.705
Otherwise, I can't face them.

00:24:49.426 --> 00:24:50.846
Alright, I'll go with you.

00:24:51.305 --> 00:24:53.305
But first, take me
to the county committee.

00:24:54.705 --> 00:24:55.205
Okay.

00:24:55.826 --> 00:24:57.386
Regarding the election for Secretary,

00:24:57.465 --> 00:24:59.305
so far, only two candidates remain.

00:24:59.666 --> 00:25:00.745
Here's what I think.

00:25:01.305 --> 00:25:02.106
Mr. Guan.

00:25:03.025 --> 00:25:03.946
Mr. Guan.

00:25:04.426 --> 00:25:04.985
Mr. Guan.

00:25:05.186 --> 00:25:05.946
Is Mr. Guan here?

00:25:06.106 --> 00:25:06.680
In a meeting.

00:25:07.426 --> 00:25:08.305
Okay, go ahead.

00:25:08.545 --> 00:25:09.305
We'll wait.

00:25:12.505 --> 00:25:13.106
Mr. Guan.

00:25:13.465 --> 00:25:14.505
Keep your voice down!

00:25:14.866 --> 00:25:15.666
- Meeting!
- Mr. Guan!

00:25:16.785 --> 00:25:17.626
I'm in trouble.

00:25:17.826 --> 00:25:19.025
You have to help me, Guan.

00:25:19.305 --> 00:25:19.805
What is it?

00:25:21.386 --> 00:25:22.106
Wait a moment.

00:25:22.346 --> 00:25:23.346
We'll talk later.

00:25:23.906 --> 00:25:25.065
There's no time!

00:25:25.386 --> 00:25:27.256
Many 'monkeys' have gathered
at Zhengjia Village,

00:25:27.346 --> 00:25:28.426
all waiting for me.

00:25:28.545 --> 00:25:29.505
(Stats Dept.)
Keep your voice down!

00:25:29.785 --> 00:25:30.426
Okay,

00:25:30.785 --> 00:25:31.346
I will.

00:25:32.465 --> 00:25:34.545
I went to Zhengjia Village
before the election.

00:25:34.946 --> 00:25:35.866
I exaggerated a bit.

00:25:36.146 --> 00:25:37.065
So now,

00:25:37.106 --> 00:25:38.985
they all think
I'm the Secretary of Yuehai.

00:25:39.826 --> 00:25:42.146
Didn't I report this to you
during the campaign?

00:25:42.465 --> 00:25:43.586
You did,

00:25:43.866 --> 00:25:45.240
but it doesn't mean it is settled.

00:25:45.406 --> 00:25:46.946
I have to criticize you for this.

00:25:47.245 --> 00:25:48.785
How could you just brag

00:25:48.785 --> 00:25:49.946
before it is settled?

00:25:50.465 --> 00:25:51.505
You messed it up,

00:25:51.666 --> 00:25:52.666
and I clean up your mess?

00:25:53.265 --> 00:25:53.765
You wish!

00:25:53.985 --> 00:25:54.866
Not like that.

00:25:54.946 --> 00:25:56.946
How would I dare to let you do that?

00:25:57.305 --> 00:25:58.465
Look at the register book.

00:25:58.785 --> 00:25:59.866
What does it prove?

00:26:00.666 --> 00:26:02.666
It proves my plan is viable.

00:26:03.186 --> 00:26:04.906
I urge the higher-ups to be decisive.

00:26:05.106 --> 00:26:06.146
Just appoint me.

00:26:06.626 --> 00:26:07.586
Their signatures

00:26:07.785 --> 00:26:09.505
have nothing to do with appointing you.

00:26:10.666 --> 00:26:11.666
You're unreasonable.

00:26:12.346 --> 00:26:13.826
If you don't go, they also won't go?

00:26:15.346 --> 00:26:17.386
If I don't go,
maybe they won't go either.

00:26:17.705 --> 00:26:19.785
What do you mean by that? A threat?

00:26:20.166 --> 00:26:21.785
I swear!

00:26:22.186 --> 00:26:23.826
That's definitely not what I mean.

00:26:24.346 --> 00:26:26.106
Mr. Guan, look for yourself.

00:26:26.146 --> 00:26:27.985
They signed themselves

00:26:28.025 --> 00:26:29.805
voluntarily here.

00:26:29.946 --> 00:26:31.065
I never forced them!

00:26:38.505 --> 00:26:40.426
Zheng Decheng, you're pissing me off!

00:26:40.426 --> 00:26:42.626
(Signature Book)
Guan, let me tell you again.

00:26:42.985 --> 00:26:44.106
If the county gives money,

00:26:44.426 --> 00:26:46.626
anyone can be the Secretary of Yuehai.

00:26:47.106 --> 00:26:48.346
But if the county doesn't,

00:26:48.626 --> 00:26:49.666
in Pingchuan County,

00:26:49.985 --> 00:26:51.985
I'm the only one
capable of building a city.

00:26:52.465 --> 00:26:53.225
In three years,

00:26:53.626 --> 00:26:55.065
I'll build a prosperous city.

00:26:55.426 --> 00:26:57.225
Otherwise, I'll accept any punishment.

00:26:59.225 --> 00:26:59.866
Are you done?

00:27:00.025 --> 00:27:00.525
Yes.

00:27:00.946 --> 00:27:01.446
Get out.

00:27:01.705 --> 00:27:02.205
Fine.

00:27:02.626 --> 00:27:03.186
I'll get out.

00:27:06.322 --> 00:27:07.832
(Zheng Family Ancestral Hall)

00:27:12.586 --> 00:27:13.505
Mr. Zheng, over here.

00:27:13.826 --> 00:27:14.326
He's here.

00:27:14.505 --> 00:27:15.346
- He's here.
- Discuss it with the Secretary.

00:27:15.606 --> 00:27:16.106
Zheng!

00:27:16.106 --> 00:27:17.545
The Secretary's here!

00:27:17.705 --> 00:27:18.785
The rumormonger, come out!

00:27:19.186 --> 00:27:19.985
Those who hit me?

00:27:21.305 --> 00:27:21.985
They're quiet.

00:27:21.985 --> 00:27:22.505
Indeed.

00:27:22.705 --> 00:27:23.505
That's good.

00:27:24.985 --> 00:27:25.946
Where were you guys?

00:27:26.086 --> 00:27:27.826
We were out for orders.

00:27:28.106 --> 00:27:29.785
But the client thinks
our place is remote.

00:27:29.946 --> 00:27:31.065
So, he ran away.

00:27:31.305 --> 00:27:32.106
Why bring it up?

00:27:32.106 --> 00:27:33.866
We really lost several orders
this month.

00:27:34.186 --> 00:27:34.686
Mr. Zheng,

00:27:34.805 --> 00:27:36.426
will Yuehai really be built?

00:27:36.785 --> 00:27:37.285
Mr. Zheng,

00:27:37.465 --> 00:27:39.065
are you really the Secretary of Yuehai?

00:27:39.065 --> 00:27:39.705
Are you?

00:27:39.745 --> 00:27:40.626
You're from Jinshan?

00:27:40.626 --> 00:27:41.866
- Yeah.
- Why did you come?

00:27:42.025 --> 00:27:43.025
Mr. Zheng, I'm here!

00:27:43.146 --> 00:27:43.985
Mr. Zheng.

00:27:44.106 --> 00:27:44.946
Mr. Zheng.

00:27:45.225 --> 00:27:45.725
Mr. Zheng.

00:27:45.745 --> 00:27:46.245
Mr. Zheng.

00:27:46.565 --> 00:27:47.065
Mr. Zheng.

00:27:47.065 --> 00:27:49.265
Tell us!
Have you become the Secretary of Yuehai?

00:27:49.666 --> 00:27:50.166
Have you?

00:27:50.946 --> 00:27:53.065
Those who hit me, watch and listen up!

00:28:25.785 --> 00:28:26.285
Well...

00:28:37.705 --> 00:28:38.785
Today,

00:28:39.866 --> 00:28:40.866
I've kept you waiting.

00:28:41.146 --> 00:28:41.666
Sit.

00:28:41.946 --> 00:28:42.745
Sit.

00:28:43.386 --> 00:28:44.346
Quick, sit down.

00:28:45.866 --> 00:28:48.225
Although Mr. Zheng arrived late,

00:28:48.785 --> 00:28:49.745
finally,

00:28:50.586 --> 00:28:52.025
he is here.

00:28:52.666 --> 00:28:53.166
Good!

00:28:53.666 --> 00:28:54.166
Good!

00:28:57.025 --> 00:28:57.586
Say something!

00:29:24.065 --> 00:29:24.906
So many bikes.

00:29:26.946 --> 00:29:27.906
So many people.

00:29:28.225 --> 00:29:30.106
You just forge boldly ahead.

00:29:30.705 --> 00:29:32.505
Don't be afraid
of earning too much money.

00:29:32.985 --> 00:29:34.586
Don't be afraid of getting rich fast.

00:29:35.065 --> 00:29:38.065
If you have the skill,
you can even touch the sky!

00:29:40.025 --> 00:29:40.525
The sky!

00:29:40.866 --> 00:29:42.406
You're worried you'll miss the chance

00:29:42.505 --> 00:29:43.666
to start over, right?

00:29:43.666 --> 00:29:44.305
Make way please.

00:29:44.305 --> 00:29:46.265
- Thank you.
- This is your chance.

00:29:46.866 --> 00:29:48.025
In the near future,

00:29:48.906 --> 00:29:50.666
you will work with your hands

00:29:51.386 --> 00:29:54.906
for a better life.

00:29:55.826 --> 00:29:56.626
And Yuehai

00:29:56.985 --> 00:29:58.826
is the new starting point for all of us.

00:29:59.386 --> 00:30:01.386
- Good!
- Good!

00:30:01.426 --> 00:30:02.826
Good!

00:30:03.186 --> 00:30:04.065
Well said!

00:30:04.065 --> 00:30:05.106
Apologize to me!

00:30:05.346 --> 00:30:06.025
Look at him.

00:30:06.606 --> 00:30:07.106
Hurry up!

00:30:07.106 --> 00:30:07.785
Quite eloquent.

00:30:08.745 --> 00:30:10.426
Listen! You guys, apologize to me.

00:30:12.906 --> 00:30:14.265
What a great speech!

00:30:14.265 --> 00:30:15.705
- Good!
- Good!

00:30:15.826 --> 00:30:16.985
Is his speech good?

00:30:17.106 --> 00:30:18.146
- Yes.
- Yes.

00:30:18.146 --> 00:30:18.646
Yes.

00:30:18.866 --> 00:30:19.985
But you're going off topic.

00:30:20.025 --> 00:30:20.946
I'll say it again.

00:30:21.186 --> 00:30:22.586
Just tell everyone!

00:30:22.785 --> 00:30:24.146
Did you become the Secretary?

00:30:24.186 --> 00:30:25.745
- Don't rush!
- We want to know this.

00:30:25.785 --> 00:30:27.705
- Yes.
- Yes, this is the key point.

00:30:28.065 --> 00:30:29.025
Right?

00:30:30.626 --> 00:30:32.632
Yes. Just tell us.
Did you get the position?

00:30:32.785 --> 00:30:34.025
Be patient, you guys.

00:30:34.186 --> 00:30:35.545
Mr. Zheng, sit!

00:30:35.666 --> 00:30:36.386
Listen to him.

00:30:36.505 --> 00:30:37.225
- Sit down.
- Did you?

00:30:37.225 --> 00:30:37.745
Come on.

00:30:38.666 --> 00:30:39.305
Well...

00:30:41.906 --> 00:30:42.705
Well...

00:30:43.065 --> 00:30:43.985
Basically...

00:30:45.305 --> 00:30:46.225
That is to say...

00:30:48.186 --> 00:30:49.186
It's a done deal.

00:30:49.386 --> 00:30:49.985
Come on.

00:30:50.025 --> 00:30:50.745
Don't talk

00:30:50.785 --> 00:30:51.946
- with such dramatic pauses!
- Be straight!

00:30:52.146 --> 00:30:54.426
Why not just say yes to them?

00:30:54.465 --> 00:30:55.545
That's right.

00:30:55.666 --> 00:30:56.906
Don't say maybe.

00:30:56.906 --> 00:30:58.586
Is it basically confirmed?

00:30:58.906 --> 00:31:00.106
Or is it a done deal?

00:31:00.545 --> 00:31:01.586
Yes, what is it?

00:31:04.866 --> 00:31:05.586
Just say it.

00:31:05.745 --> 00:31:06.245
Exactly!

00:31:06.680 --> 00:31:08.440
We're very eager to know.

00:31:08.826 --> 00:31:09.346
Mr. Zheng.

00:31:30.866 --> 00:31:31.705
Must be a done deal!

00:31:32.025 --> 00:31:35.985
- Great!
- Great!

00:31:36.745 --> 00:31:37.785
You guys, apologize to me!

00:31:37.985 --> 00:31:40.346
- Great!
- Great!

00:31:44.866 --> 00:31:45.826
Apologize!

00:31:45.866 --> 00:31:47.505
Who told you?

00:31:52.705 --> 00:31:53.465
The leaders!

00:31:53.505 --> 00:31:54.426
Make way!

00:31:54.826 --> 00:31:55.846
Mr. Zhao!

00:31:55.846 --> 00:31:56.705
What brings you here?

00:31:57.426 --> 00:31:58.906
I'll introduce this man.

00:31:59.386 --> 00:32:01.946
This is Mr. Zhao,
Secretary of our county.

00:32:03.025 --> 00:32:04.065
- Mr. Xia, County Magistrate.
- Hello.

00:32:04.346 --> 00:32:05.946
Minister Guan and Li.

00:32:06.106 --> 00:32:08.465
And other leaders.
Let's give them a round of applause!

00:32:08.586 --> 00:32:10.065
- Welcome!
- Welcome!

00:32:16.505 --> 00:32:17.346
Everyone,

00:32:17.386 --> 00:32:18.866
where are you all from?

00:32:19.386 --> 00:32:20.505
I'm from Jiangku.

00:32:20.906 --> 00:32:22.586
Sir, I'm from Jinshan.

00:32:23.065 --> 00:32:24.666
Sir, I'm from Beizhen.

00:32:24.946 --> 00:32:27.545
We all traveled for hours to get here.

00:32:27.545 --> 00:32:28.045
True.

00:32:28.065 --> 00:32:29.065
We are locals.

00:32:29.465 --> 00:32:30.552
From a neighboring village.

00:32:30.785 --> 00:32:31.545
It's surprising

00:32:31.626 --> 00:32:33.426
that you came all the way here.

00:32:33.745 --> 00:32:34.616
I have a question.

00:32:34.616 --> 00:32:38.745
Why do you follow Zheng Decheng
to Yuehai?

00:32:39.745 --> 00:32:41.346
It's very simple.

00:32:41.626 --> 00:32:42.946
He can lead us to make money.

00:32:42.946 --> 00:32:43.946
Of course, we follow him.

00:32:44.106 --> 00:32:44.626
- Right?
- He's smart.

00:32:44.826 --> 00:32:45.666
- Yes.
- He's smart.

00:32:45.826 --> 00:32:47.586
He always thinks of common folks!

00:32:47.846 --> 00:32:48.346
Right?

00:32:48.346 --> 00:32:49.106
Yes.

00:32:49.146 --> 00:32:50.386
Sir, you know what?

00:32:50.465 --> 00:32:52.906
I'm timid. But Mr. Zheng is bold.

00:32:52.985 --> 00:32:54.025
He is way too bold.

00:32:54.025 --> 00:32:55.386
- Yes.
- Be quiet.

00:32:55.386 --> 00:32:56.265
Watch your words.

00:32:56.666 --> 00:32:57.626
I'm telling the truth.

00:32:58.505 --> 00:32:59.005
Be quiet!

00:32:59.065 --> 00:33:00.305
Sir, to be honest,

00:33:00.465 --> 00:33:02.785
following Mr. Zheng, we feel secure.

00:33:02.846 --> 00:33:03.346
Yes.

00:33:03.346 --> 00:33:04.386
- True.
- True.

00:33:05.106 --> 00:33:06.386
Fellow villagers!

00:33:06.705 --> 00:33:09.305
Those wanting to follow Zheng Decheng,
raise your hands.

00:33:09.426 --> 00:33:10.106
Yes.

00:33:10.386 --> 00:33:12.225
Those who want Mr. Zheng in Yuehai,

00:33:12.265 --> 00:33:13.465
raise your hands!

00:33:15.186 --> 00:33:15.866
Yes.

00:33:16.146 --> 00:33:16.666
Two hands up.

00:33:16.826 --> 00:33:19.265
- Surrendering?
- Two hands up.

00:33:19.346 --> 00:33:20.186
- Both hands?
- Surrendering?

00:33:20.426 --> 00:33:20.985
You disagree?

00:33:21.146 --> 00:33:21.826
One hand is fine.

00:33:21.826 --> 00:33:22.346
Raise.

00:33:32.225 --> 00:33:33.426
Let's discuss it in the car.

00:33:34.106 --> 00:33:34.606
Okay.

00:33:35.505 --> 00:33:36.946
We do need to discuss this properly.

00:33:39.545 --> 00:33:40.045
Decheng.

00:33:40.666 --> 00:33:42.446
Wait here and don't leave.

00:33:53.842 --> 00:33:57.367
(Get off First)

00:33:58.465 --> 00:33:58.985
Decheng.

00:34:00.946 --> 00:34:02.505
You're here too.

00:34:03.106 --> 00:34:04.626
Well...

00:34:04.946 --> 00:34:06.505
I want to talk to you about something.

00:34:09.226 --> 00:34:09.726
Sir.

00:34:12.545 --> 00:34:13.045
Okay.

00:34:13.585 --> 00:34:15.025
Just go ahead.

00:34:17.426 --> 00:34:17.926
Well...

00:34:20.545 --> 00:34:22.226
Yuehai.

00:34:22.906 --> 00:34:23.786
Well...

00:34:24.426 --> 00:34:25.906
- Well...
- I know.

00:34:26.266 --> 00:34:28.786
You want to go to Yuehai too, right?

00:34:29.306 --> 00:34:29.906
Decheng.

00:34:30.585 --> 00:34:31.625
I must go

00:34:32.665 --> 00:34:33.585
to Yuehai.

00:34:33.866 --> 00:34:34.906
Look at the three of them.

00:34:35.426 --> 00:34:37.976
They still haven't found partners yet.

00:34:38.392 --> 00:34:40.185
My eldest son is already 28.

00:34:40.346 --> 00:34:41.386
My second son is 25.

00:34:42.025 --> 00:34:43.826
My third son is already 18.

00:34:44.465 --> 00:34:45.985
If they keep staying in the village,

00:34:46.105 --> 00:34:47.866
my family line will die out.

00:34:48.465 --> 00:34:49.346
So, I think

00:34:49.946 --> 00:34:52.706
if they had urban residency,

00:34:53.266 --> 00:34:55.465
it would be easier
for them to find a wife.

00:34:59.266 --> 00:34:59.946
Decheng.

00:35:02.826 --> 00:35:04.465
Could you

00:35:05.706 --> 00:35:07.145
lend me some money?

00:35:08.585 --> 00:35:09.906
I'll write you an IOU.

00:35:10.665 --> 00:35:11.985
What are you talking about?

00:35:12.306 --> 00:35:14.105
If you need money, I'll give it to you.

00:35:14.266 --> 00:35:16.985
No, that won't do.
I must write you an IOU.

00:35:17.145 --> 00:35:18.226
I'll write it.

00:35:18.266 --> 00:35:19.386
No, I'll give it to you.

00:35:19.946 --> 00:35:20.786
I'll give it to you.

00:35:20.786 --> 00:35:22.746
Just listen to me. I'll write the IOU.

00:35:23.465 --> 00:35:24.866
I'm begging you.

00:35:25.185 --> 00:35:25.786
Write the IOU.

00:35:27.665 --> 00:35:29.465
Alright then. I'll listen to you.

00:35:29.946 --> 00:35:30.625
Do as you say.

00:35:31.025 --> 00:35:32.105
Write the IOU, okay?

00:35:32.105 --> 00:35:32.946
That's settled then.

00:35:34.145 --> 00:35:34.906
You may leave.

00:35:35.185 --> 00:35:35.786
Okay.

00:35:36.706 --> 00:35:37.985
We'll get going now.

00:35:38.185 --> 00:35:38.706
We're off.

00:35:39.266 --> 00:35:40.516
Take our stool.

00:35:40.516 --> 00:35:41.266
Leave.

00:35:47.065 --> 00:35:47.565
Decheng.

00:35:48.426 --> 00:35:49.065
Come here.

00:35:54.346 --> 00:35:55.306
Keep this safe.

00:35:57.545 --> 00:35:58.306
Thank you.

00:35:58.906 --> 00:36:01.906
If you build Yuehai well,
I'll bow to you.

00:36:02.306 --> 00:36:03.306
I'm humbled.

00:36:03.625 --> 00:36:04.625
Truly.

00:36:15.946 --> 00:36:17.065
What did he mean?

00:36:17.665 --> 00:36:18.386
Work hard.

00:36:20.505 --> 00:36:22.226
Don't play dumb. It's you.

00:36:22.706 --> 00:36:24.145
You'll receive an appointment soon.

00:36:42.354 --> 00:36:43.786
(Beloved Wife Ma Suying)

00:36:43.786 --> 00:36:44.505
Suying.

00:36:46.306 --> 00:36:47.505
Dapeng is grown up now.

00:36:50.065 --> 00:36:50.985
Our son

00:36:52.145 --> 00:36:52.906
has been good.

00:36:53.625 --> 00:36:54.185
Rest in peace.

00:36:55.866 --> 00:36:56.985
I'm good too.

00:36:58.625 --> 00:36:59.426
I came

00:37:00.485 --> 00:37:02.065
to tell you some good news.

00:37:03.585 --> 00:37:04.266
We are

00:37:05.625 --> 00:37:06.906
building a city in this place.

00:37:07.545 --> 00:37:08.786
We will

00:37:09.185 --> 00:37:12.105
have what big cities have,
like tall buildings,

00:37:12.946 --> 00:37:14.025
roads, and cars.

00:37:15.386 --> 00:37:16.226
And hospitals.

00:37:42.386 --> 00:37:43.386
Where did you get a car?

00:37:44.065 --> 00:37:45.112
From the newspaper.

00:37:45.112 --> 00:37:47.128
Only I have a license,
so they let me drive it.

00:37:52.754 --> 00:37:54.904
(Our daughter lost the election.)

00:38:05.145 --> 00:38:07.226
Alright. My parents are home.

00:38:08.346 --> 00:38:09.426
My parents are home.

00:38:09.426 --> 00:38:10.834
(Our daughter lost the election.)

00:38:23.314 --> 00:38:25.826
(Our daughter lost the election.
Happy now?)

00:38:25.826 --> 00:38:27.625
They're arguing again?

00:38:33.306 --> 00:38:33.826
Mom.

00:38:36.625 --> 00:38:37.125
Dad.

00:38:37.426 --> 00:38:38.346
Du Tao is here.

00:38:38.786 --> 00:38:40.665
Sir, madam, I came to see you.

00:38:41.545 --> 00:38:42.465
Tao, you're here.

00:38:43.386 --> 00:38:45.145
You have a seat. I'll be right there.

00:38:45.505 --> 00:38:46.145
Okay.

00:38:47.465 --> 00:38:48.185
Tao, you're here.

00:38:48.465 --> 00:38:49.266
Yes, sir.

00:38:50.585 --> 00:38:51.085
Sir.

00:38:51.125 --> 00:38:52.125
- Tao.
- Long time no see.

00:38:52.226 --> 00:38:53.545
Yes, long time.

00:38:53.786 --> 00:38:54.585
Come and sit.

00:38:54.826 --> 00:38:55.386
Okay.

00:38:55.426 --> 00:38:56.306
Sir.

00:38:56.465 --> 00:38:57.786
I brought you some things.

00:38:57.946 --> 00:38:59.266
The famous tea, Longjing,

00:38:59.746 --> 00:39:02.465
cigarettes, liquor, coffee, and such.

00:39:02.585 --> 00:39:03.346
All you like.

00:39:03.426 --> 00:39:04.306
Thank you.

00:39:04.465 --> 00:39:06.105
I'm glad you could come.

00:39:06.826 --> 00:39:07.465
Tao.

00:39:08.226 --> 00:39:08.726
Madam.

00:39:08.826 --> 00:39:09.665
Long time no see.

00:39:09.665 --> 00:39:10.266
Long time.

00:39:10.266 --> 00:39:11.505
You look younger.

00:39:12.306 --> 00:39:12.946
Hold on.

00:39:13.145 --> 00:39:16.585
I brought you a silk scarf
with Suzhou embroidery,

00:39:16.946 --> 00:39:19.025
a round fan, and some royal jelly.

00:39:19.266 --> 00:39:20.985
- Try them all later.
- Tao,

00:39:21.226 --> 00:39:21.866
you're so kind.

00:39:21.946 --> 00:39:23.266
I love everything you bought.

00:39:23.746 --> 00:39:24.426
That's good.

00:39:24.545 --> 00:39:25.065
Please sit.

00:39:25.226 --> 00:39:26.226
Okay.

00:39:27.025 --> 00:39:27.525
Qiuping.

00:39:28.226 --> 00:39:28.726
Come.

00:39:29.985 --> 00:39:30.786
A gift for me too?

00:39:31.025 --> 00:39:31.525
Yes.

00:39:31.786 --> 00:39:32.286
Look,

00:39:33.025 --> 00:39:34.025
my friend helped buy it.

00:39:34.145 --> 00:39:36.105
It's tailored to your measurements.

00:39:36.226 --> 00:39:36.746
- Really?
- Also,

00:39:37.346 --> 00:39:38.625
this bag is for you.

00:39:40.065 --> 00:39:40.665
Thank you.

00:39:41.065 --> 00:39:41.866
See if you like it.

00:39:42.826 --> 00:39:43.465
I like it.

00:39:44.545 --> 00:39:45.226
Tao.

00:39:45.625 --> 00:39:46.185
Madam.

00:39:46.585 --> 00:39:47.985
This fan must be expensive, right?

00:39:48.545 --> 00:39:50.465
As long as you like it,
the cost doesn't matter.

00:39:50.826 --> 00:39:53.386
Do you think this scarf looks nice?

00:39:54.866 --> 00:39:55.786
It suits me perfectly.

00:39:56.585 --> 00:39:57.085
I know.

00:39:57.545 --> 00:39:59.665
(A three-foot sword hung at his waist.)

00:39:59.706 --> 00:40:02.105
(Astride a blue-maned steed,)

00:40:02.465 --> 00:40:05.346
(wielding a pair of iron maces.
Standing there,)

00:40:05.465 --> 00:40:08.065
(he looks like a vajra
or a smoke-blackened deity.)

00:40:08.145 --> 00:40:09.826
(It's Yue Fei's second junior brother.)

00:40:10.145 --> 00:40:11.866
(The second brother, Niu Gao.)

00:40:12.746 --> 00:40:15.346
(The officer
on the right is nine feet tall,)

00:40:15.786 --> 00:40:17.346
(wearing a mottled curled helmet,)

00:40:17.706 --> 00:40:20.706
(with five back-flags
fluttering in the wind.)

00:40:20.746 --> 00:40:23.306
(Clad in golden armor
beneath a blue robe...)

00:40:23.346 --> 00:40:24.786
Did you try on that outfit?

00:40:25.426 --> 00:40:28.346
You need to dress well
on your first day in the office.

00:40:29.185 --> 00:40:30.306
No need to try it.

00:40:30.985 --> 00:40:31.906
It's alright.

00:40:32.786 --> 00:40:33.505
What?

00:40:34.025 --> 00:40:35.505
What a nice outfit!

00:40:36.746 --> 00:40:37.560
Leave for a moment.

00:40:38.226 --> 00:40:38.726
Okay.

00:40:47.306 --> 00:40:48.786
You put it here?

00:40:49.585 --> 00:40:50.866
Quite surprising.

00:40:51.545 --> 00:40:52.105
Well...

00:41:17.665 --> 00:41:20.265
This is all we have. You know it.

00:41:20.536 --> 00:41:21.266
Gao Xuemei.

00:41:22.185 --> 00:41:22.685
Yes!

00:41:22.985 --> 00:41:24.226
Shake my hand enthusiastically.

00:41:25.985 --> 00:41:28.706
Mayor Xie, welcome to inspect my work.

00:41:28.906 --> 00:41:29.826
Alright, good.

00:41:31.746 --> 00:41:34.886
I'm about to take office
at the town government.

00:41:35.185 --> 00:41:37.025
So today, I'm formally instructing you.

00:41:37.706 --> 00:41:39.185
You should say, "at your service."

00:41:39.346 --> 00:41:40.145
At your service.

00:41:42.266 --> 00:41:43.025
Today,

00:41:43.746 --> 00:41:46.985
I officially appoint you
as director of Chunmei Printery.

00:41:52.426 --> 00:41:53.706
But am I qualified?

00:41:53.906 --> 00:41:54.585
Or hand it back.

00:41:55.266 --> 00:41:55.985
I can do it!

00:41:55.985 --> 00:41:56.906
- Can you?
- Yes!

00:41:56.906 --> 00:41:57.505
Can you do it?

00:41:57.786 --> 00:41:59.625
Sure, I can.

00:41:59.625 --> 00:42:00.185
How?

00:42:00.726 --> 00:42:02.585
- Well...
- Manage our home well.

00:42:03.665 --> 00:42:06.306
We earned the money together.

00:42:06.625 --> 00:42:07.465
- Right?
- Yes.

00:42:07.746 --> 00:42:09.665
Spending money is easy, right?

00:42:10.105 --> 00:42:11.160
Handling money is not.

00:42:11.906 --> 00:42:12.906
Don't worry.

00:42:13.185 --> 00:42:14.866
You charge ahead on the front lines,

00:42:15.065 --> 00:42:16.746
while I'll guard the money in the rear.

00:42:17.346 --> 00:42:18.426
Count it every single day!

00:42:18.545 --> 00:42:19.145
Okay.

00:42:20.065 --> 00:42:20.625
By the way,

00:42:21.065 --> 00:42:22.906
since you're becoming the town mayor,

00:42:23.105 --> 00:42:24.746
the salary should increase, right?

00:42:25.985 --> 00:42:28.266
Salary increase?
All you think about is money!

00:42:28.706 --> 00:42:29.826
Are you obsessed with money?

00:42:30.786 --> 00:42:31.826
You're the director.

00:42:32.105 --> 00:42:32.665
- Right?
- Yes.

00:42:32.906 --> 00:42:34.145
Not only are you the director,

00:42:34.306 --> 00:42:36.105
but you're also the town mayor's family.

00:42:36.706 --> 00:42:37.206
Yes.

00:42:37.426 --> 00:42:38.665
Watch your words and actions.

00:42:38.786 --> 00:42:39.826
Okay.

00:42:40.346 --> 00:42:41.226
The password...

00:42:41.465 --> 00:42:42.266
- Listen...
- I know it.

00:42:45.346 --> 00:42:46.386
Our marriage date, right?

00:42:46.985 --> 00:42:48.145
Never change it.

00:42:48.625 --> 00:42:49.185
Lock it.

00:42:50.465 --> 00:42:51.105
Don't worry.

00:42:51.266 --> 00:42:53.665
I won't fail your guidance.

00:42:55.746 --> 00:42:56.386
What guidance?

00:42:57.786 --> 00:42:58.625
You're a natural.

00:42:59.545 --> 00:43:00.984
