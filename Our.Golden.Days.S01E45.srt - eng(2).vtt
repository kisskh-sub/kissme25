00:00:01.719 --> 00:00:02.759
So,

00:00:03.519 --> 00:00:05.129
if you don't get a heart transplant,

00:00:05.759 --> 00:00:07.189
I hear you'll die in a few months.

00:00:08.999 --> 00:00:11.999
If they have to watch their own child die,

00:00:13.869 --> 00:00:15.439
it's best their pain is as brief as possible.

00:00:22.279 --> 00:00:23.279
Dad.

00:00:33.519 --> 00:00:34.559
Father.

00:00:37.989 --> 00:00:38.989
What... (Support Admin Watch on
kissasia.cam or kisskh.org)

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:40.959
What is...

00:00:41.559 --> 00:00:44.429
What is all this? You two...

00:00:45.169 --> 00:00:46.829
What were you just talking about?

00:00:47.529 --> 00:00:48.639
Who's dying?

00:00:51.709 --> 00:00:52.709
Dad.

00:00:54.309 --> 00:00:56.009
What are you doing here?

00:00:56.339 --> 00:00:57.509
Explain...

00:00:58.109 --> 00:00:59.649
Tell me properly.

00:01:00.179 --> 00:01:02.849
What did I just hear?

00:01:05.249 --> 00:01:06.719
I'm asking why you're at the office.

00:01:07.349 --> 00:01:09.289
I brought you your lunch, you brat.

00:01:12.389 --> 00:01:17.129
What? Why would you bring me lunch? Why are you even here?

00:01:17.659 --> 00:01:20.699
Just explain yourself, you punk!

00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:30.509
How much did you hear?

00:01:33.749 --> 00:01:36.619
That if you don't get a heart transplant...

00:01:37.519 --> 00:01:39.949
you'll die. That's what Seong Jae...

00:02:15.219 --> 00:02:16.619
I feel like I've let my guard down too much.

00:02:17.459 --> 00:02:19.429
So I'm trying to maintain a professional distance.

00:02:19.629 --> 00:02:20.789
I'm sorry, Eun Oh.

00:02:21.159 --> 00:02:22.159
It seems we...

00:02:22.899 --> 00:02:23.959
just missed each other.

00:02:24.829 --> 00:02:26.099
I've already moved on.

00:02:26.599 --> 00:02:27.669
From now on,

00:02:29.039 --> 00:02:30.199
I'm going to keep things strictly professional.

00:02:53.859 --> 00:02:54.959
When...

00:02:55.759 --> 00:02:57.099
and how did you find out?

00:02:59.999 --> 00:03:02.899
I didn't actually go to Tokyo on a business trip.

00:03:03.799 --> 00:03:06.239
I was in the hospital for three days getting emergency treatment,

00:03:07.769 --> 00:03:10.779
and on top of that, I had a full workup.

00:03:12.279 --> 00:03:13.879
You weren't on a business trip?

00:03:16.219 --> 00:03:18.349
There are too many people on the transplant list,

00:03:19.849 --> 00:03:21.659
so they say it's unlikely I'll get one in time.

00:03:24.389 --> 00:03:25.389
So now...

00:03:27.029 --> 00:03:28.129
You get it now, right?

00:03:28.429 --> 00:03:29.429
What...

00:03:29.929 --> 00:03:32.869
Understand what?

00:03:33.799 --> 00:03:34.869
Fine.

00:03:35.299 --> 00:03:39.739
This acute myo-something, or whatever.

00:03:41.109 --> 00:03:44.279
How does that make any sense? A healthy guy like you?

00:03:45.249 --> 00:03:49.879
You have lots of sports gear. How can you have a heart problem?

00:03:52.289 --> 00:03:55.259
A few months ago, I went to the ER for severe body aches.

00:03:56.819 --> 00:04:00.859
And the viral myocarditis had already started back then,

00:04:02.299 --> 00:04:05.299
but they missed it. It kept progressing until...

00:04:06.129 --> 00:04:07.499
it suddenly got worse.

00:04:09.099 --> 00:04:10.539
I already told you all this.

00:04:11.509 --> 00:04:12.669
Do I have to repeat myself?

00:04:13.369 --> 00:04:17.139
- Did you get a second opinion? - Dad.

00:04:19.009 --> 00:04:20.549
The one thing I need you to do for me now...

00:04:21.849 --> 00:04:24.549
is make sure Mom, Ji Wan, and Su Bin don't find out.

00:04:26.419 --> 00:04:28.419
I want to live as if nothing is wrong.

00:04:30.719 --> 00:04:31.989
For as long as I have left.

00:04:32.459 --> 00:04:35.099
Do you hear yourself, kid?

00:04:35.659 --> 00:04:39.569
The eldest son's sick. We must unite and find a solution, you punk.

00:04:43.099 --> 00:04:44.099
Seong Jae.

00:04:44.939 --> 00:04:47.769
Can you take my father home for me?

00:04:48.479 --> 00:04:50.909
I have some things I need to finish up here today.

00:04:51.009 --> 00:04:54.549
Are you out of your mind? In your condition?

00:04:54.609 --> 00:04:57.519
Forget about work and business! Go home right now.

00:04:57.579 --> 00:04:59.389
This is exactly why I wanted to keep it a secret.

00:05:03.419 --> 00:05:04.689
If I go home with you right now,

00:05:06.089 --> 00:05:07.759
what's going to change?

00:05:08.299 --> 00:05:09.699
What are you going to do with me there?

00:05:12.469 --> 00:05:13.469
What?

00:05:13.799 --> 00:05:17.539
You need to rest. That's the first thing. Rest.

00:05:18.539 --> 00:05:19.539
But...

00:05:20.409 --> 00:05:22.939
why are you giving up already?

00:05:23.539 --> 00:05:26.609
It could be a misdiagnosis. Another hospital might disagree.

00:05:26.679 --> 00:05:29.249
- Let's try another hospital, okay? - Dad.

00:05:32.349 --> 00:05:34.389
I have a follow-up appointment on Monday,

00:05:35.589 --> 00:05:37.289
so you can come with me and see for yourself.

00:05:37.919 --> 00:05:39.689
There's no need to go to another hospital.

00:05:57.539 --> 00:05:58.549
Father.

00:05:59.149 --> 00:06:00.409
Please, come with me.

00:06:01.849 --> 00:06:03.919
How can I leave Ji Hyuk here?

00:06:04.349 --> 00:06:06.419
Are you crazy? Are you out of your mind?

00:06:09.559 --> 00:06:10.589
Father.

00:06:11.789 --> 00:06:14.129
Who do you think this is hardest on right now?

00:06:39.149 --> 00:06:41.319
So that's what this was all about, Ji Hyuk.

00:06:42.819 --> 00:06:43.889
I'm so sorry.

00:06:58.669 --> 00:07:00.369
So, what brings you all the way to the office?

00:07:02.179 --> 00:07:04.279
I came because you've decided to see this through to the end.

00:07:05.949 --> 00:07:07.009
I want a divorce.

00:07:07.709 --> 00:07:10.449
A divorce? Why would I give you a divorce?

00:07:12.319 --> 00:07:13.889
You're refusing to get a divorce?

00:07:14.749 --> 00:07:17.059
Don't you remember what my family...

00:07:17.059 --> 00:07:18.559
and everyone in the business world...

00:07:18.559 --> 00:07:20.159
had to say when I remarried you?

00:07:21.529 --> 00:07:25.569
An orphan who only finished high school. A widowed waitress.

00:07:25.899 --> 00:07:27.629
Of course, I didn't care about any of that.

00:07:28.939 --> 00:07:32.909
A gold digger who seduced Chairman Park with just her looks.

00:07:33.769 --> 00:07:35.339
I heard every terrible thing they said.

00:07:36.339 --> 00:07:37.909
But none of it mattered to me.

00:07:39.209 --> 00:07:43.149
So why would I turn around now and admit that they were all right?

00:07:43.879 --> 00:07:46.449
It would prove I've been deceived for 26 long years.

00:07:48.089 --> 00:07:49.659
Get another divorce because of you?

00:07:51.389 --> 00:07:53.159
I will not have another divorce in my life.

00:07:55.399 --> 00:07:56.999
If you have no intention of divorcing me,

00:07:57.199 --> 00:07:59.199
then why did you push me to this point?

00:08:00.369 --> 00:08:01.429
Take a guess.

00:08:02.099 --> 00:08:07.039
Reading and manipulating people... Isn't that your specialty?

00:08:08.139 --> 00:08:11.009
I never, ever forgive anyone who deceives me.

00:08:11.339 --> 00:08:13.509
And yet, he says he won't get a divorce.

00:08:15.549 --> 00:08:16.879
What could I possibly want?

00:08:18.389 --> 00:08:19.689
You snake.

00:08:20.289 --> 00:08:23.019
What is it? What is he thinking?

00:08:25.689 --> 00:08:27.789
I know you, Park Jin Seok.

00:08:28.659 --> 00:08:30.699
You could never forgive me.

00:08:31.529 --> 00:08:32.529
Bingo.

00:08:34.999 --> 00:08:37.669
So even groveling and begging won't work.

00:08:39.469 --> 00:08:41.839
If you even knew that I had a secret safe,

00:08:42.539 --> 00:08:45.549
you weren't trusting me 100 percent, were you?

00:08:46.479 --> 00:08:47.809
When exactly did you find out?

00:08:48.479 --> 00:08:49.819
I deserve to know that much.

00:08:51.749 --> 00:08:54.149
I didn't know. I never even dreamed of it.

00:08:54.689 --> 00:08:57.659
Not until I realized you were lying to me.

00:08:58.359 --> 00:08:59.759
But then I found out.

00:09:00.259 --> 00:09:02.959
That Woo Jin took a leave of absence to get a liver transplant.

00:09:04.429 --> 00:09:07.099
And don't get the wrong idea. Seong Jae didn't tell me.

00:09:08.839 --> 00:09:10.739
It wasn't Seong Jae who told you?

00:09:11.939 --> 00:09:14.769
"Ko Seong Hui has been deceiving me like this?"

00:09:15.039 --> 00:09:17.079
Someone who could deceive me. Was that who she was?

00:09:18.579 --> 00:09:20.549
So, I started thinking.

00:09:21.509 --> 00:09:22.519
What are you up to?

00:09:24.819 --> 00:09:27.689
I was thinking of wearing the watch we bought in Rome.

00:09:27.919 --> 00:09:29.719
- I have my book club today. - Right.

00:09:32.689 --> 00:09:35.459
One stack each. You really never change.

00:09:36.129 --> 00:09:38.669
Rather modest for a chairman's wife, don't you think?

00:09:39.129 --> 00:09:41.699
Excuse me? I have buildings, apartments,

00:09:41.769 --> 00:09:45.569
jewelry, and cash. I've got it all in here.

00:09:46.309 --> 00:09:49.409
You always opened the safe right in front of me,

00:09:49.879 --> 00:09:52.249
as if to say, "I'm not greedy. All of my assets..."

00:09:52.349 --> 00:09:56.019
"are where my husband can see. I even gave you the password."

00:09:57.849 --> 00:10:00.349
A woman who cared that much about money...

00:10:00.889 --> 00:10:04.459
wouldn't possibly be satisfied with something so simple.

00:10:05.729 --> 00:10:08.699
That must be a decoy safe, meant to fool me.

00:10:08.999 --> 00:10:11.129
Of course. In that case,

00:10:11.729 --> 00:10:14.829
where would she have hidden her real fortune?

00:10:16.869 --> 00:10:17.999
Right.

00:10:19.039 --> 00:10:22.539
After my father passed away, you redecorated the entire house.

00:10:23.509 --> 00:10:24.739
So it was all too obvious.

00:10:33.389 --> 00:10:35.619
A place I would never suspect.

00:10:36.219 --> 00:10:37.619
Somewhere I'd never touch.

00:10:37.959 --> 00:10:39.729
And there it was, a remote, right out in the open.

00:11:18.729 --> 00:11:21.529
(Ji Eun Oh Files)

00:11:27.109 --> 00:11:28.209
So that's how you found out.

00:11:30.139 --> 00:11:31.949
You're really something else.

00:11:33.349 --> 00:11:37.449
When I trusted you, I never had a single doubt.

00:11:38.019 --> 00:11:40.319
But once I knew you were deceiving me...

00:11:41.619 --> 00:11:46.559
I can be just as clever as you. No, even cleverer.

00:11:49.629 --> 00:11:52.729
If you're not going to divorce me, why did you clean out my safe?

00:11:53.429 --> 00:11:56.869
I used the properties you gave me as gifts...

00:11:56.939 --> 00:11:59.569
to build my own wealth. Why would you take that from me?

00:12:01.139 --> 00:12:03.379
And what proof do you have that I took it?

00:12:04.779 --> 00:12:07.349
You took out mortgages on them in your name.

00:12:07.879 --> 00:12:12.019
- Park Jin Seok. In your name. - Is that so? How odd.

00:12:12.849 --> 00:12:13.849
You're insane.

00:12:20.029 --> 00:12:22.899
You really are the man I chose.

00:12:24.829 --> 00:12:27.799
But why are you so angry without even hearing me out?

00:12:28.899 --> 00:12:31.869
The truth is, you can't see what's truly in someone's heart.

00:12:32.709 --> 00:12:36.909
If you felt my feelings were real, then they were.

00:12:37.779 --> 00:12:41.149
And if you were happy, then it was me who made you happy.

00:12:41.919 --> 00:12:44.219
So does it matter if my feelings were real or not?

00:12:44.779 --> 00:12:46.919
Gosh, I hate all that nonsense.

00:12:47.689 --> 00:12:51.319
Look, even if I was only nice to you for your money,

00:12:51.389 --> 00:12:54.759
- it's also a sincere kind of love. - What?

00:12:56.829 --> 00:12:58.099
But you...

00:12:59.329 --> 00:13:01.729
don't seem like you could accept my kind of love.

00:13:03.069 --> 00:13:06.209
Then I guess we've expired, haven't we?

00:13:07.769 --> 00:13:10.809
We can't be complete strangers because of Yeong Ra.

00:13:11.439 --> 00:13:12.449
Right?

00:13:12.909 --> 00:13:16.649
And you can't leave me, Yeong Ra's mother, destitute.

00:13:16.719 --> 00:13:18.449
Not that you could, anyway.

00:13:19.289 --> 00:13:22.389
Let's handle this divorce with some class.

00:13:23.089 --> 00:13:27.029
Let me live in a style befitting Yeong Ra's mom and your ex-wife.

00:13:28.599 --> 00:13:30.699
I already told you, we're not getting a divorce.

00:13:31.929 --> 00:13:34.429
I'm sure you don't want to. For now.

00:13:34.899 --> 00:13:36.539
But our relationship is already broken.

00:13:38.099 --> 00:13:39.109
Look,

00:13:39.769 --> 00:13:42.239
I won't ask for any of your assets in the settlement.

00:13:42.879 --> 00:13:44.309
Just give me back what's mine.

00:13:44.809 --> 00:13:47.779
If this goes to a divorce lawsuit with those mortgages,

00:13:47.849 --> 00:13:50.219
you'll be completely humiliated and forced to divorce me anyway.

00:13:50.979 --> 00:13:52.719
And those mortgages will be nullified.

00:13:54.949 --> 00:13:57.059
What is this nonsense you keep spouting?

00:13:57.559 --> 00:13:59.089
How are you going to divorce me?

00:13:59.959 --> 00:14:01.559
On what grounds? Have I done anything wrong?

00:14:02.599 --> 00:14:05.099
The at-fault party can't file for divorce.

00:14:06.699 --> 00:14:08.399
And how am I the one at fault?

00:14:09.299 --> 00:14:10.299
What?

00:14:10.399 --> 00:14:12.809
That I said my daughter was dead when she was still alive?

00:14:13.109 --> 00:14:14.839
That was before we were married.

00:14:15.739 --> 00:14:18.579
Was it because I didn't tell you Woo Jin needed a liver transplant?

00:14:19.009 --> 00:14:20.709
Or that I looked for my daughter for the transplant?

00:14:21.449 --> 00:14:24.619
That was my motherly love for the son I had actually raised.

00:14:25.219 --> 00:14:27.819
How did any of that hurt you?

00:14:28.349 --> 00:14:32.459
- Did I ask for a liver, or money? - Shut that trap!

00:14:33.829 --> 00:14:36.499
Do you still see me as the same fool who used to trust you?

00:14:37.159 --> 00:14:39.529
How dare you spout such utter nonsense?

00:14:40.399 --> 00:14:41.899
You loved Woo Jin so much?

00:14:42.669 --> 00:14:44.099
That love didn't extend to your daughter?

00:14:44.899 --> 00:14:47.909
Is that why you lied that she died of pneumonia when she was one,

00:14:48.209 --> 00:14:51.139
and even filed a death certificate for a child who was still alive?

00:14:52.349 --> 00:14:53.809
All so you could marry me.

00:14:54.209 --> 00:14:56.819
You're the one who did something so vile.

00:14:58.119 --> 00:15:00.019
You've been lying to me from the very beginning.

00:15:00.849 --> 00:15:02.519
And lying about Woo Jin's liver transplant?

00:15:03.259 --> 00:15:05.259
That was so you could steal the heir position from Seong Jae.

00:15:05.559 --> 00:15:06.889
He had to be healthy for that.

00:15:08.359 --> 00:15:11.629
Yeong Ra's marriage was just a way for you to satisfy your own vanity.

00:15:12.399 --> 00:15:15.799
You spent your whole life subtly undermining Seong Jae.

00:15:17.299 --> 00:15:18.599
You think I'd divorce the likes of you...

00:15:19.509 --> 00:15:20.709
and go through another divorce?

00:15:22.239 --> 00:15:24.779
You will die as my wife.

00:15:26.349 --> 00:15:30.419
Then what are you saying? What do you want from me?

00:15:31.079 --> 00:15:32.949
What? You just said you wouldn't divorce me.

00:15:33.219 --> 00:15:37.659
What? You've hidden all my money. So, should I just move back in?

00:15:37.789 --> 00:15:40.329
How dare someone like you set foot in my house!

00:15:40.389 --> 00:15:41.689
Then what am I supposed to do?

00:15:42.159 --> 00:15:45.129
You won't divorce me, won't pay me, and you won't let me come home.

00:15:45.199 --> 00:15:47.729
So what am I supposed to do? How am I supposed to live?

00:15:49.899 --> 00:15:51.569
Go back to where you came from.

00:15:53.269 --> 00:15:54.469
Where I came from?

00:15:56.939 --> 00:16:00.909
I'm putting you right back where you were before you met me.

00:16:02.479 --> 00:16:03.579
What did you just say?

00:16:04.349 --> 00:16:08.349
Go back to the life you had without me, as Ko Seong Hui.

00:16:09.019 --> 00:16:10.059
In the gutter.

00:16:11.489 --> 00:16:13.229
Are you out of your mind?

00:16:13.689 --> 00:16:18.199
That's your punishment for deceiving me for 26 years.

00:16:20.769 --> 00:16:23.099
I want you out of this house by the time I get home.

00:16:23.899 --> 00:16:26.709
Didn't I tell you I don't want to see your face when I get back?

00:16:28.239 --> 00:16:31.279
Honey, please. Why are you doing this? Why?

00:16:31.579 --> 00:16:33.509
Why are you doing this? Let go of me!

00:16:37.179 --> 00:16:38.719
Dad told me to give this to you, Mom.

00:16:39.019 --> 00:16:42.119
I left 2,000 dollars in that account for you.

00:16:42.189 --> 00:16:46.259
That'll last you what, three days in a hotel before it's gone.

00:16:48.189 --> 00:16:50.029
Park Jin Seok, you crazy jerk.

00:16:50.959 --> 00:16:53.729
You expect me to leave with nothing and fend for myself?

00:16:54.229 --> 00:16:55.939
Why should I?

00:16:56.569 --> 00:16:58.339
After everything I've done for you?

00:16:58.909 --> 00:17:01.569
I ironed your underwear, I looked after your health,

00:17:01.739 --> 00:17:03.779
I cooked for you, and met your needs.

00:17:03.779 --> 00:17:05.809
I even went to college to keep up.

00:17:06.179 --> 00:17:09.519
And you'd kick me out with nothing? You think I'll let you?

00:17:13.149 --> 00:17:14.989
Or would you rather I have you committed?

00:17:15.989 --> 00:17:16.989
What?

00:17:17.519 --> 00:17:22.499
If the wife of Shoe Joy's chairman screams her head off in his office,

00:17:22.999 --> 00:17:24.999
people might just think she has a few screws loose.

00:17:26.499 --> 00:17:27.969
You don't have any other family.

00:17:28.729 --> 00:17:29.939
Your legal guardian...

00:17:31.069 --> 00:17:32.239
is me, and me alone.

00:17:35.239 --> 00:17:36.679
Now, take out your phone.

00:17:44.579 --> 00:17:46.449
(Standard)

00:17:49.819 --> 00:17:50.859
Listen carefully.

00:17:52.289 --> 00:17:55.289
If one word of this gets out, you're dead.

00:17:56.459 --> 00:17:58.899
If I hear so much as a peep from you,

00:17:59.829 --> 00:18:01.669
you'll disappear without a trace.

00:18:03.569 --> 00:18:06.739
Don't go running to law firms and letting things slip.

00:18:07.909 --> 00:18:10.839
Honey, I'm Yeong Ra's mother.

00:18:12.779 --> 00:18:15.179
And what about you? Did you ever really love me?

00:18:15.779 --> 00:18:20.049
If you had, you'd have given Woo Jin your name.

00:18:20.289 --> 00:18:23.959
You just let him live as Han Woo Jin in the Park household, on eggshells.

00:18:24.019 --> 00:18:25.089
Don't make excuses.

00:18:25.929 --> 00:18:28.189
I couldn't change his last name because of my parents, but...

00:18:29.099 --> 00:18:30.529
I raised him as my own son.

00:18:31.099 --> 00:18:32.399
And Woo Jin knows that.

00:18:33.399 --> 00:18:37.099
My pockets are empty. Where will I sleep and eat?

00:18:38.399 --> 00:18:39.969
Find a job that offers room and board.

00:18:41.209 --> 00:18:42.639
You're a good cook,

00:18:43.009 --> 00:18:44.179
so I'm sure you'll have plenty of options.

00:18:47.679 --> 00:18:48.679
Get out.

00:18:52.719 --> 00:18:54.949
I guess I never really knew you.

00:18:56.719 --> 00:18:57.859
But...

00:18:58.759 --> 00:19:01.489
you don't know everything about me, either.

00:19:27.419 --> 00:19:30.689
Yeong Ra, it's me, Mom. Yeong Ra, open the door.

00:19:39.269 --> 00:19:40.269
Mom?

00:19:41.269 --> 00:19:43.039
Unbelievable.

00:19:46.209 --> 00:19:48.979
How could you want to slum it in a place like this?

00:19:49.639 --> 00:19:51.539
- My gosh. - What are you doing here?

00:19:53.809 --> 00:19:56.449
"Mom, how have you been?"

00:19:58.479 --> 00:20:00.149
Mom, how have you been?

00:20:02.149 --> 00:20:04.089
After everything I did to raise you,

00:20:04.719 --> 00:20:08.129
I get kicked out, and you couldn't even call me once?

00:20:09.399 --> 00:20:11.959
I figured you'd call if you needed anything.

00:20:12.669 --> 00:20:13.669
Is that so?

00:20:15.739 --> 00:20:16.739
Darn.

00:20:19.839 --> 00:20:21.039
Now,

00:20:22.439 --> 00:20:24.239
I'm here because I really need my daughter.

00:20:25.379 --> 00:20:26.379
My gosh.

00:20:27.109 --> 00:20:30.719
- What happened with Dad? - I need to sue for my money.

00:20:31.449 --> 00:20:32.619
Get me 200,000 dollars.

00:20:33.949 --> 00:20:34.949
Did you say 200,000 dollars?

00:20:35.789 --> 00:20:39.129
Your father went behind my back and used my official seal...

00:20:39.429 --> 00:20:43.359
and mortgaged all of my properties so I can't sell them.

00:20:43.999 --> 00:20:45.399
I have to sue him to get them back.

00:20:46.329 --> 00:20:48.329
How can you even think of suing him?

00:20:48.669 --> 00:20:51.969
- You should be begging Dad. - Don't butt in. You know nothing.

00:20:53.809 --> 00:20:55.469
I'll tell you everything later.

00:20:56.509 --> 00:20:57.779
I don't have 200,000 dollars.

00:20:58.779 --> 00:21:01.579
You have those stocks your grandfather left you.

00:21:03.819 --> 00:21:05.649
Sell them as soon as the market opens on Monday.

00:21:06.919 --> 00:21:09.459
Of all the rotten luck, it's the weekend.

00:21:11.189 --> 00:21:12.189
Got it?

00:21:13.929 --> 00:21:15.129
I'll think about it.

00:21:15.429 --> 00:21:17.729
What's there to think about?

00:21:18.259 --> 00:21:21.329
You saw me get kicked out with just the clothes on my back.

00:21:23.499 --> 00:21:24.869
And give me one of your credit cards.

00:21:27.509 --> 00:21:29.239
Don't you have anything to say to me?

00:21:30.779 --> 00:21:32.379
You're supposed to say you're sorry.

00:21:33.049 --> 00:21:36.379
If I can't land on my feet, you'll be a laughingstock too.

00:21:38.449 --> 00:21:40.549
So you'd better convince your father.

00:21:41.149 --> 00:21:44.359
Tell him to stop treating me poorly and give me back my property.

00:21:45.089 --> 00:21:47.759
And if he won't, tell him I'll divorce him. Got it?

00:21:48.159 --> 00:21:50.399
Remember, you are my daughter.

00:21:53.999 --> 00:21:55.069
Just a second.

00:21:57.299 --> 00:21:58.299
Unbelievable.

00:22:02.509 --> 00:22:03.809
I can't give you the card.

00:22:04.179 --> 00:22:05.209
It's in Dad's name.

00:22:06.009 --> 00:22:10.079
You knew I was coming and got out some cash for me.

00:22:11.679 --> 00:22:12.689
How much?

00:22:13.149 --> 00:22:14.149
Five hundred dollars.

00:22:14.719 --> 00:22:18.289
What? 500? Not 10,000...

00:22:18.689 --> 00:22:21.159
Not even 5,000, but 500?

00:22:23.229 --> 00:22:24.529
Transfer 10,000 dollars to me right now.

00:22:26.269 --> 00:22:28.569
My OTP authenticator and everything are at home.

00:22:31.939 --> 00:22:33.739
Then go home and transfer the 10,000,

00:22:34.409 --> 00:22:36.639
and send the 200,000 as soon as the stocks sell.

00:22:37.209 --> 00:22:38.839
I'll text you my debit card account details.

00:22:41.679 --> 00:22:42.679
Okay.

00:22:54.789 --> 00:22:55.829
Park Yeong Ra.

00:22:58.459 --> 00:22:59.469
Ji Wan.

00:23:00.029 --> 00:23:01.799
What are you doing out here alone in the cold?

00:23:07.069 --> 00:23:08.069
Are you crying?

00:23:09.709 --> 00:23:10.809
Hey, what's going on? What's wrong?

00:23:11.309 --> 00:23:12.409
Did something happen?

00:23:12.849 --> 00:23:15.549
- It's nothing. - Nothing? You're crying.

00:23:16.219 --> 00:23:17.619
I'm asking you, what's wrong?

00:23:18.479 --> 00:23:20.719
You left like you wanted nothing to do with me.

00:23:22.289 --> 00:23:23.619
I had something to deal with.

00:23:24.619 --> 00:23:27.929
Why are you suddenly showing up and prying into my business?

00:23:29.229 --> 00:23:30.229
Your business?

00:23:32.059 --> 00:23:33.629
You said we were battle buddies,

00:23:34.969 --> 00:23:37.439
but you left like you didn't want me to ever contact you again.

00:23:38.069 --> 00:23:39.669
Same with the day you came for the recommendation letter.

00:23:41.709 --> 00:23:42.739
That was...

00:23:44.509 --> 00:23:47.379
That was honestly to help you stand on your own two feet.

00:23:48.649 --> 00:23:50.449
So why are you here today?

00:23:53.819 --> 00:23:55.089
I'm here about that thing.

00:23:55.959 --> 00:23:58.319
The collaboration you proposed.

00:23:59.889 --> 00:24:02.529
You're going to be my story writer?

00:24:02.659 --> 00:24:05.059
No, I'm saying I'm doing it.

00:24:05.529 --> 00:24:09.469
I'm not doing it for you. I'm doing it because I want to.

00:24:09.539 --> 00:24:13.269
I can get a security job anytime, but being a webtoon story writer...

00:24:13.609 --> 00:24:15.369
- Co-writer. - Right.

00:24:15.869 --> 00:24:19.009
Being a co-writer isn't a chance that comes around all the time.

00:24:19.249 --> 00:24:21.149
So this "Urban Rapunzel..."

00:24:22.279 --> 00:24:23.579
I really want to give it a shot.

00:24:24.379 --> 00:24:26.189
If you haven't changed your mind, that is.

00:24:26.289 --> 00:24:28.689
Me? Of course not!

00:24:29.519 --> 00:24:30.959
Then from now on,

00:24:31.919 --> 00:24:34.489
we're not Ms. Yeong Ra and her bodyguard anymore.

00:24:47.039 --> 00:24:48.039
Father.

00:24:48.469 --> 00:24:50.309
- Have some water. - What?

00:25:00.319 --> 00:25:03.689
Su Bin might be home, so why don't you go to your room?

00:25:04.289 --> 00:25:06.729
Su Bin's out. She's out.

00:25:07.689 --> 00:25:08.689
Seong Jae.

00:25:09.059 --> 00:25:12.029
Our Ji Hyuk... What are we going to do about him?

00:25:15.529 --> 00:25:16.539
Father.

00:25:17.839 --> 00:25:18.969
First of all,

00:25:19.769 --> 00:25:23.579
I hope you'll try to understand how Ji Hyuk feels first.

00:25:24.639 --> 00:25:28.079
What? Are you saying I shouldn't tell his mom?

00:25:28.679 --> 00:25:31.379
You're taking this hard as it is,

00:25:31.749 --> 00:25:34.389
can you imagine how his mom will react if she finds out?

00:25:36.219 --> 00:25:37.659
Ji Hyuk must always feel...

00:25:38.419 --> 00:25:40.859
like his life is just fading away.

00:25:42.159 --> 00:25:45.299
If he has to watch the two of you in shock and pain on top of that,

00:25:45.929 --> 00:25:47.399
can you imagine how hard that'd be for him?

00:25:47.969 --> 00:25:51.339
No way. This can't be it. We have to look into it again.

00:25:51.399 --> 00:25:53.769
If we look, we will find another way.

00:25:53.969 --> 00:25:56.009
How can they suddenly say...

00:25:56.009 --> 00:25:58.039
that only a heart transplant can save him?

00:25:58.209 --> 00:26:00.109
Medical care in this country is top-notch!

00:26:01.079 --> 00:26:02.679
No matter what you do, Father,

00:26:03.819 --> 00:26:06.449
please just let Ji Hyuk do what he wants.

00:26:08.219 --> 00:26:09.219
What?

00:26:09.789 --> 00:26:12.089
I also went to convince Ji Hyuk today.

00:26:12.489 --> 00:26:14.189
I told him to tell the family everything.

00:26:16.059 --> 00:26:17.699
But after seeing how you're reacting,

00:26:19.399 --> 00:26:21.099
I think Ji Hyuk was right.

00:26:31.379 --> 00:26:33.309
(Thirty Houses)

00:26:41.149 --> 00:26:42.189
The lunchbox...

00:27:13.789 --> 00:27:14.789
Dad.

00:27:19.759 --> 00:27:21.559
It's like you knew when you made this.

00:27:23.859 --> 00:27:24.999
It's delicious.

00:27:28.869 --> 00:27:31.239
And not too salty.

00:27:37.239 --> 00:27:38.409
I'm sorry, Dad.

00:28:25.689 --> 00:28:26.989
Is he crying?

00:28:30.559 --> 00:28:32.629
Why would he be crying right after leaving our house?

00:28:37.769 --> 00:28:40.739
Be home by seven. We need to talk.

00:28:49.519 --> 00:28:50.519
What?

00:28:52.249 --> 00:28:53.549
What's going on?

00:28:54.689 --> 00:28:56.259
Why was he at our house?

00:29:14.569 --> 00:29:15.569
Dad.

00:29:21.279 --> 00:29:24.549
Dad, why is the door locked? Are you in your room?

00:29:25.449 --> 00:29:28.449
I was just taking a little nap.

00:29:30.659 --> 00:29:32.059
You've been in your room this whole time?

00:29:33.059 --> 00:29:36.659
I'm tired, so I'm going to get a little more sleep.

00:29:39.329 --> 00:29:40.499
Okay.

00:29:43.539 --> 00:29:44.969
Dad's voice...

00:29:50.979 --> 00:29:52.309
This is strange.

00:29:52.809 --> 00:29:55.549
Seong Jae just left our house.

00:29:56.349 --> 00:29:59.319
Dad was the only one home, and he says he was napping?

00:30:00.619 --> 00:30:01.749
Something's off.

00:30:02.119 --> 00:30:05.419
Dad's voice is hoarse, too. Like he's been crying.

00:30:07.359 --> 00:30:09.489
Did he come to ask for our blessing again?

00:30:10.729 --> 00:30:12.559
And then Dad must have chewed him out.

00:30:14.369 --> 00:30:18.069
But wait, Dad said he was napping. Why is he pretending not to see him?

00:30:21.609 --> 00:30:23.439
So he did come to ask for Dad's blessing.

00:30:24.139 --> 00:30:27.449
Seong Jae must've gotten chewed out, and Dad must be really upset too.

00:30:28.879 --> 00:30:31.419
Why didn't Seong Jae say a word to me?

00:30:34.489 --> 00:30:36.589
(Seong Jae)

00:30:38.689 --> 00:30:39.689
No.

00:30:40.089 --> 00:30:42.729
If he asked for their blessing, he would've told me.

00:30:44.829 --> 00:30:45.929
So what's going on?

00:30:48.869 --> 00:30:53.769
Since you both knew before me, I'll just be frank.

00:30:56.379 --> 00:30:58.279
As you both know,

00:30:58.579 --> 00:31:00.909
I truly loved and trusted your mother.

00:31:02.309 --> 00:31:04.749
That she was pure, without any ulterior motives,

00:31:05.679 --> 00:31:08.149
and a person full of love.

00:31:08.749 --> 00:31:09.759
That's what I believed.

00:31:10.919 --> 00:31:14.129
And you know how much I hate being deceived,

00:31:14.389 --> 00:31:18.199
and how much I despise liars. You both know that.

00:31:22.129 --> 00:31:24.399
I have decided not to forgive that woman.

00:31:29.169 --> 00:31:30.239
Does that mean...

00:31:30.939 --> 00:31:32.379
you're getting a divorce?

00:31:32.939 --> 00:31:34.179
Not really.

00:31:34.879 --> 00:31:36.679
But we're not going to live together, either.

00:31:37.979 --> 00:31:40.789
After deceiving and lying to me for 26 years,

00:31:41.119 --> 00:31:42.989
she has to pay the price.

00:31:44.119 --> 00:31:47.159
Then what on earth are you planning to do?

00:31:49.659 --> 00:31:51.929
She'll have to survive out there on her own.

00:31:58.339 --> 00:32:00.469
To the both of you, I am so,

00:32:01.269 --> 00:32:02.469
so sorry.

00:32:04.909 --> 00:32:05.909
Seong Jae.

00:32:07.549 --> 00:32:10.019
I'm sorry for being so blind.

00:32:12.919 --> 00:32:13.919
Yeong Ra.

00:32:15.189 --> 00:32:18.259
I thought your mother raised you with only love and care,

00:32:19.789 --> 00:32:22.029
and I'm sorry for neglecting you.

00:32:24.529 --> 00:32:27.029
Dad, are you okay?

00:32:28.299 --> 00:32:31.839
Don't worry. Your dad's a grown-up. I'm fine.

00:32:45.879 --> 00:32:46.919
(Lawyer)

00:32:46.989 --> 00:32:48.849
(Terra Law Firm, Neorium Law Firm)

00:32:48.989 --> 00:32:52.159
Don't go running to law firms and letting things slip.

00:32:52.519 --> 00:32:54.489
Or would you rather I have you committed?

00:32:57.199 --> 00:32:59.159
I don't need a major law firm.

00:32:59.729 --> 00:33:03.739
If I sue over the secret mortgage, it's an open-and-shut case.

00:33:04.299 --> 00:33:06.239
You'd be facing criminal charges, too.

00:33:08.139 --> 00:33:09.439
Have me committed?

00:33:10.579 --> 00:33:15.079
You think you can threaten me, and I'll just go work in a kitchen?

00:33:20.049 --> 00:33:23.019
(Dilated Cardiomyopathy)

00:33:26.419 --> 00:33:28.689
(Have You Heard of Dilated Cardiomyopathy?)

00:33:33.399 --> 00:33:34.399
(Why is it so dangerous?)

00:33:34.399 --> 00:33:35.529
(If the condition progresses, up to 70 percent die.)

00:33:50.079 --> 00:33:51.249
(May they rest in peace.)

00:33:51.319 --> 00:33:52.319
(That happens to so many people.)

00:33:52.379 --> 00:33:53.719
(The list is too long. You must prepare for the worst.)

00:34:01.089 --> 00:34:03.299
Where have you been? What took you so long?

00:34:04.499 --> 00:34:05.799
Dad, you're home.

00:34:05.859 --> 00:34:10.299
- I had... I had to meet someone. - Who?

00:34:10.499 --> 00:34:11.499
Where's Ji Hyuk?

00:34:12.099 --> 00:34:16.239
- In his room. Should I get him? - No, just let him be.

00:34:16.979 --> 00:34:19.579
I'm not feeling well either. I think I'm getting sick.

00:34:19.639 --> 00:34:20.809
I should go lie down.

00:34:21.849 --> 00:34:23.149
Did you take anything for it?

00:34:26.689 --> 00:34:28.649
Is Dad sick or something?

00:34:30.119 --> 00:34:31.389
Does Dad have cancer?

00:34:43.539 --> 00:34:44.969
I can't get one full day...

00:34:46.199 --> 00:34:47.809
of peace and quiet.

00:34:48.969 --> 00:34:51.739
Why are you lying to me?

00:34:53.679 --> 00:34:54.779
What if I told you...

00:34:56.509 --> 00:34:59.619
that I like you? I...

00:35:01.049 --> 00:35:03.219
The misunderstandings I had about you,

00:35:04.759 --> 00:35:06.189
they're all cleared up now.

00:35:07.229 --> 00:35:08.929
Eun Oh says the misunderstanding's been cleared up.

00:35:10.429 --> 00:35:11.499
And so,

00:35:12.759 --> 00:35:15.229
I've forgiven you for everything.

00:35:16.269 --> 00:35:17.599
And she's forgiven me.

00:35:18.339 --> 00:35:20.769
And what if I mean it when I say...

00:35:21.669 --> 00:35:23.579
I like you again?

00:35:24.309 --> 00:35:25.539
Eun Oh...

00:35:26.779 --> 00:35:28.609
She has feelings for me again.

00:35:29.579 --> 00:35:30.779
It seems we...

00:35:31.319 --> 00:35:32.379
just missed each other.

00:35:34.519 --> 00:35:36.149
I've already moved on.

00:35:38.159 --> 00:35:40.689
Moved on? Who am I kidding?

00:36:14.229 --> 00:36:15.889
Hey, Mom. You're home.

00:36:17.199 --> 00:36:19.359
I didn't hear you come in.

00:36:20.699 --> 00:36:21.699
Eun Oh.

00:36:22.069 --> 00:36:24.639
Why are the tofu pockets still here, untouched?

00:36:24.899 --> 00:36:26.069
Oh, that.

00:36:26.499 --> 00:36:29.269
I was at the office, but felt under the weather, so I came home.

00:36:29.809 --> 00:36:31.279
So you haven't eaten anything all day?

00:36:31.679 --> 00:36:33.039
I guess not.

00:36:34.209 --> 00:36:35.249
By any chance,

00:36:35.809 --> 00:36:38.019
did something happen with Ji Hyuk?

00:36:38.779 --> 00:36:39.779
No.

00:36:40.119 --> 00:36:42.519
Ji Hyuk didn't come in to work today.

00:36:43.419 --> 00:36:44.489
I'm sorry, Mom.

00:36:45.059 --> 00:36:47.459
I should've put the lunchbox in the fridge.

00:36:47.889 --> 00:36:49.429
You should eat something, then.

00:36:49.589 --> 00:36:54.099
It's okay. I had snacks at work, so I'm just going to get some rest.

00:36:54.369 --> 00:36:56.199
Okay, sure. Gang Oh, let's give her some space.

00:36:56.199 --> 00:36:58.039
You get some rest.

00:36:58.669 --> 00:36:59.669
Let's go.

00:37:15.989 --> 00:37:16.989
No...

00:37:19.159 --> 00:37:20.289
Something's...

00:37:21.159 --> 00:37:22.159
not right.

00:37:23.159 --> 00:37:24.699
No, I guess it means I like you.

00:37:25.099 --> 00:37:27.999
I like you so much, I can't stand it. I...

00:37:29.029 --> 00:37:30.369
I have to win you back.

00:37:30.939 --> 00:37:33.939
Eun Oh. I swear, for the rest of my life,

00:37:34.139 --> 00:37:35.569
you're the only one for me.

00:37:36.109 --> 00:37:40.209
How can I earn your forgiveness? That's my biggest worry.

00:37:40.409 --> 00:37:43.719
Besides your mom, there's no one who worries about you more than me.

00:37:43.919 --> 00:37:45.119
It seems we...

00:37:45.649 --> 00:37:48.519
just missed each other. I've already moved on.

00:37:49.989 --> 00:37:51.419
Ji Hyuk...

00:37:53.629 --> 00:37:55.159
is lying.

00:38:09.239 --> 00:38:11.679
Since when did you start snoring?

00:38:13.679 --> 00:38:15.679
Of course you're exhausted.

00:38:37.069 --> 00:38:40.239
You finally have a Sunday off for the first time in forever.

00:38:40.409 --> 00:38:42.269
And of all days, it had to be when I have to work?

00:38:42.739 --> 00:38:44.339
I'll take next Sunday off, too.

00:38:44.879 --> 00:38:46.609
- Really? - Yes.

00:38:46.679 --> 00:38:48.209
Go on, hurry to work.

00:38:48.749 --> 00:38:51.679
Who knew working on a weekend would be this bad?

00:38:52.649 --> 00:38:54.049
I'm off.

00:38:54.049 --> 00:38:55.449
- Have a good day. - Have a good day.

00:38:59.459 --> 00:39:00.789
I'm heading up, too.

00:39:18.139 --> 00:39:19.709
Dad is definitely acting weird.

00:39:25.379 --> 00:39:27.619
Ji Hyuk still isn't at the office?

00:39:30.889 --> 00:39:33.989
He's not one to take a Sunday off like this.

00:39:34.689 --> 00:39:36.489
While I was on my business trip,

00:39:36.559 --> 00:39:39.429
I did some thinking about my position as CEO.

00:39:40.099 --> 00:39:42.269
He said he wanted to focus on the company.

00:39:42.869 --> 00:39:44.899
So why isn't he here on a Sunday, when he always comes in?

00:39:57.019 --> 00:40:01.619
Su Bin, tell Ji Wan to come on up. Let's order in and have lunch.

00:40:03.019 --> 00:40:04.019
Dad.

00:40:05.189 --> 00:40:06.189
Yes, what is it?

00:40:07.089 --> 00:40:10.089
What should we order for lunch? How about some bossam?

00:40:11.729 --> 00:40:13.969
Bossam sounds good.

00:40:14.429 --> 00:40:16.829
Bro, what's gotten into you? Taking Sunday off?

00:40:17.539 --> 00:40:18.839
Su Bin, order the bossam.

00:40:19.339 --> 00:40:20.509
Let's get bossam.

00:40:20.809 --> 00:40:22.539
- Sounds delicious. - Awesome!

00:40:26.479 --> 00:40:27.709
Wow, this is delicious.

00:40:28.679 --> 00:40:30.349
Ji Hyuk, have some noodles. I'll get you some.

00:40:30.419 --> 00:40:32.079
No, it's fine. Don't.

00:40:32.579 --> 00:40:36.289
I've had indigestion lately, so I'm avoiding spicy and salty food.

00:40:36.349 --> 00:40:38.219
- I see. - I'll take those noodles then.

00:40:38.519 --> 00:40:39.519
Sure.

00:40:39.819 --> 00:40:43.829
Ji Wan, if you get the security job, you should start saving every month.

00:40:44.129 --> 00:40:45.659
You have to save up for marriage, right?

00:40:45.799 --> 00:40:48.229
Geez, I'll handle it myself.

00:40:49.529 --> 00:40:50.739
I'll handle it myself.

00:40:54.809 --> 00:40:57.109
Su Bin, how have you been lately?

00:40:57.739 --> 00:40:59.609
Want me to set you up with someone?

00:41:00.909 --> 00:41:02.379
You should worry about yourself.

00:41:03.479 --> 00:41:06.579
Word on the street is you've got a massive crush.

00:41:07.419 --> 00:41:10.289
For real? You? With an unrequited love?

00:41:10.889 --> 00:41:12.559
Aren't you the one who's always getting crushed on?

00:41:14.189 --> 00:41:17.129
Dad, you can't keep a secret, can you?

00:41:18.629 --> 00:41:20.669
Wait, how did you know about that anyway, Dad?

00:41:21.369 --> 00:41:24.039
You're telling me.

00:41:24.839 --> 00:41:28.509
When was the last time we ordered in without Mom?

00:41:29.009 --> 00:41:33.039
Forget that. It's been ages since the three of us had takeout.

00:41:34.879 --> 00:41:39.219
- I know. I've been too busy. - Seriously.

00:41:39.679 --> 00:41:42.919
Ever since you got a job, you've barely been home on weekends.

00:41:43.959 --> 00:41:47.089
You're right. I've been out way too much.

00:41:49.859 --> 00:41:53.299
Is this the normal life you wanted to have?

00:41:57.769 --> 00:41:58.899
Dad, what's wrong?

00:42:00.199 --> 00:42:01.569
Are you not feeling well?

00:42:02.139 --> 00:42:06.239
No, it's nothing. I was just thinking about old times.

00:42:13.919 --> 00:42:16.119
Ji Wan, I'm at my studio.

00:42:16.549 --> 00:42:18.089
Unbelievable.

00:42:19.319 --> 00:42:21.759
I have to run. I'll see you all later.

00:42:22.159 --> 00:42:23.859
Hey, okay. See you.

00:42:34.769 --> 00:42:39.239
(Vice President Park Seong Jae)

00:42:39.539 --> 00:42:41.579
What am I doing here on a Sunday?

00:42:43.479 --> 00:42:45.979
I have decided not to forgive that woman.

00:42:47.049 --> 00:42:49.749
After deceiving and lying to me for 26 years,

00:42:50.149 --> 00:42:52.059
she has to pay the price.

00:42:53.419 --> 00:42:55.789
You think I can't handle this?

00:42:59.199 --> 00:43:00.869
I should have moved out sooner.

00:43:03.739 --> 00:43:05.439
I wonder if everything's okay at Ji Hyuk's place.

00:43:12.739 --> 00:43:14.679
You're at the office again today, aren't you?

00:43:15.479 --> 00:43:16.479
Wait.

00:43:17.579 --> 00:43:19.619
Why is Su Bin texting me all of a sudden?

00:43:21.349 --> 00:43:23.919
Shoot, what should I say?

00:43:25.689 --> 00:43:28.089
I'm heading to your office. I need to talk to you.

00:43:30.329 --> 00:43:31.329
Here?

00:43:37.399 --> 00:43:39.939
It's been a while since I've just relaxed on a Sunday.

00:43:43.209 --> 00:43:45.379
The air is nice and crisp. It feels good.

00:43:58.789 --> 00:44:00.629
- Mom. - Oh my.

00:44:00.689 --> 00:44:01.759
(Jameon Medical Devices)

00:44:01.859 --> 00:44:04.729
Look at my mom working so hard.

00:44:04.929 --> 00:44:08.129
Ji Hyuk, what a surprise. I thought you had the day off.

00:44:08.869 --> 00:44:11.139
I was just out for a walk.

00:44:11.299 --> 00:44:12.369
I see.

00:44:12.369 --> 00:44:14.839
It's only three bus stops away, so it's a nice walk, isn't it?

00:44:15.439 --> 00:44:17.179
Wait. Do you walk here too, Mom?

00:44:17.709 --> 00:44:20.509
I'm usually in a rush in the morning, so I take the bus,

00:44:20.509 --> 00:44:22.109
but sometimes I walk home.

00:44:24.719 --> 00:44:25.719
I see.

00:44:26.779 --> 00:44:27.989
What really brings you here?

00:44:29.419 --> 00:44:32.259
I just wanted to see where you work.

00:44:32.719 --> 00:44:35.059
Am I not supposed to just drop by like this?

00:44:35.589 --> 00:44:36.829
Don't be silly.

00:44:37.759 --> 00:44:39.459
It's just a little out of character for you.

00:44:42.699 --> 00:44:44.669
What? How am I being weird?

00:44:45.469 --> 00:44:50.069
You were never the kind of son who'd go out of your way to visit.

00:44:52.209 --> 00:44:53.209
I guess you're right.

00:44:54.149 --> 00:44:55.249
I guess I...

00:44:55.579 --> 00:44:58.749
I guess I was just too busy having fun on my own.

00:44:59.949 --> 00:45:01.919
That must've upset you, Mom.

00:45:03.249 --> 00:45:04.859
I suppose I was upset at times.

00:45:05.919 --> 00:45:08.759
But that's just how all kids are when they grow up.

00:45:10.229 --> 00:45:11.429
Back then, I thought time...

00:45:12.329 --> 00:45:13.829
would last forever.

00:45:16.969 --> 00:45:18.499
Go on, get back to work.

00:45:29.609 --> 00:45:30.949
She didn't send anything yesterday,

00:45:30.949 --> 00:45:32.879
and she's just sending it now?

00:45:33.519 --> 00:45:35.149
I'm letting you know so you're not left waiting.

00:45:36.289 --> 00:45:38.059
I won't be sending the 10,000 dollars,

00:45:38.489 --> 00:45:40.159
and I'm not selling my shares on Monday, either.

00:45:41.829 --> 00:45:43.389
What is she talking about?

00:45:43.999 --> 00:45:45.759
I can't give you the money I received...

00:45:46.099 --> 00:45:47.829
from Dad's side of the family.

00:45:48.369 --> 00:45:50.129
You deserve to be punished for what you did.

00:45:50.739 --> 00:45:52.769
What you did isn't something that can be easily forgiven.

00:45:53.499 --> 00:45:55.309
So, just like Dad wanted,

00:45:55.769 --> 00:45:58.979
I think you need to earn a living and beg for forgiveness.

00:45:59.609 --> 00:46:00.609
Take care.

00:46:01.209 --> 00:46:02.449
Has she lost her mind?

00:46:03.409 --> 00:46:06.279
(Daughter Yeong Ra)

00:46:10.619 --> 00:46:12.959
(Mom)

00:46:17.729 --> 00:46:19.429
Yeong Ra, what's wrong?

00:46:20.229 --> 00:46:21.229
Ji Wan.

00:46:23.369 --> 00:46:25.499
If you don't want to talk to her, just don't answer.

00:46:27.709 --> 00:46:29.569
My mom asked me for money,

00:46:29.869 --> 00:46:31.709
but I texted her that I wasn't going to send it,

00:46:32.309 --> 00:46:33.309
and now she won't stop calling.

00:46:34.479 --> 00:46:35.549
So that's what this is about?

00:46:37.009 --> 00:46:38.179
Then just turn off your phone.

00:46:39.079 --> 00:46:41.719
Right. Why didn't I think of that?

00:46:45.819 --> 00:46:48.229
And if she comes here, you're here, so...

00:46:50.829 --> 00:46:52.999
What if she shows up when I'm not here?

00:46:54.099 --> 00:46:55.169
I'll just...

00:46:56.129 --> 00:46:57.169
not open the door.

00:46:58.839 --> 00:47:01.309
Why did you even call me over when you're so tough now?

00:47:02.209 --> 00:47:03.439
When did I call you over?

00:47:03.769 --> 00:47:06.509
You texted me, saying you were at the studio.

00:47:07.409 --> 00:47:08.909
I said I was at the studio.

00:47:09.179 --> 00:47:10.449
I don't remember asking you to come over.

00:47:10.849 --> 00:47:14.249
- Come on, that's like an invite. - No, it's not.

00:47:18.489 --> 00:47:19.789
Your insides must've been screaming.

00:47:21.359 --> 00:47:22.359
A little.

00:47:23.089 --> 00:47:26.529
I was alone, and my mind just kept wandering back to my mom.

00:47:27.199 --> 00:47:28.229
You did the right thing.

00:47:28.769 --> 00:47:30.999
There's nothing like work to keep your mind off things.

00:47:31.469 --> 00:47:34.039
Let's start by mapping out the episodes today.

00:47:35.569 --> 00:47:36.569
Maybe we should.

00:47:36.909 --> 00:47:39.639
I tried outlining a story based on your notes,

00:47:39.939 --> 00:47:41.309
and the story possibilities are endless.

00:47:41.749 --> 00:47:44.119
So I'm thinking of aiming for over 200 episodes this time.

00:47:45.019 --> 00:47:46.179
Over 200 episodes?

00:47:46.919 --> 00:47:49.089
The phone is turned off. Please leave a message...

00:47:49.389 --> 00:47:51.359
Yeong Ra actually turned her phone off?

00:47:54.659 --> 00:47:56.429
So, Park Jin Seok has her wrapped around his finger.

00:47:59.129 --> 00:48:02.129
Why didn't I realize he'd cut off her allowance?

00:48:04.539 --> 00:48:06.669
Did he expect this to go all the way to a lawsuit?

00:48:10.309 --> 00:48:12.179
(Standard)

00:48:15.449 --> 00:48:16.449
Park Jin Seok.

00:48:17.109 --> 00:48:19.679
Fine. You're really something else.

00:48:20.849 --> 00:48:21.849
But...

00:48:22.249 --> 00:48:25.119
you don't know me as well as you think.

00:48:26.389 --> 00:48:30.259
I'm going to put you right back where you were before you met me.

00:48:31.359 --> 00:48:33.099
Not a chance.

00:48:53.219 --> 00:48:54.689
Darn it.

00:48:55.789 --> 00:48:57.319
A hundred dollars is all I have.

00:49:03.689 --> 00:49:04.999
Even if you back me into a corner like this,

00:49:06.429 --> 00:49:09.029
you can't send me to the rock bottom you're hoping for.

00:49:20.949 --> 00:49:21.949
Su Bin.

00:49:22.449 --> 00:49:23.449
How have you been?

00:49:31.359 --> 00:49:32.359
Come on in.

00:49:32.619 --> 00:49:36.559
(Shoealls)

00:49:36.629 --> 00:49:40.829
Want something to drink? My secretary's not in today, so...

00:49:42.529 --> 00:49:43.529
I don't want anything.

00:49:54.649 --> 00:49:55.749
Does my dad have cancer?

00:49:57.479 --> 00:49:58.479
What?

00:49:59.449 --> 00:50:00.619
Just be honest with me.

00:50:01.549 --> 00:50:04.619
Why were you at my house yesterday? Why did you leave in tears?

00:50:08.359 --> 00:50:10.289
You saw me leaving?

00:50:11.159 --> 00:50:13.399
Yes, I saw you.

00:50:14.499 --> 00:50:18.139
You left crying, and Dad was the only one home.

00:50:19.139 --> 00:50:23.309
I thought you came for his blessing and he'd given you a hard time.

00:50:23.909 --> 00:50:25.979
But you wouldn't do that without talking to me first.

00:50:27.439 --> 00:50:28.849
But then my dad was acting weird.

00:50:29.779 --> 00:50:31.319
He must have seen you,

00:50:32.049 --> 00:50:34.519
but he said he was taking a nap with the door locked.

00:50:35.819 --> 00:50:38.489
Then he went out and didn't come back until late.

00:50:39.319 --> 00:50:41.329
He said he wasn't feeling well and just wanted to rest.

00:50:44.959 --> 00:50:45.959
I see.

00:50:46.999 --> 00:50:50.769
I've thought about it over and over, and I'm sure it has to do with Dad.

00:50:52.569 --> 00:50:54.309
Something's wrong with my dad, isn't it?

00:50:55.769 --> 00:50:57.939
Please, just tell me.

00:50:58.209 --> 00:50:59.879
Does my dad have cancer or something?

00:51:00.579 --> 00:51:01.709
No.

00:51:02.349 --> 00:51:03.349
It's nothing like that.

00:51:03.949 --> 00:51:05.819
This is exactly why I wanted to keep it a secret!

00:51:07.919 --> 00:51:09.449
Then why were you crying?

00:51:13.219 --> 00:51:15.489
You were right.

00:51:16.729 --> 00:51:17.759
I went to ask for his blessing.

00:51:18.699 --> 00:51:20.629
I tried begging him one more time.

00:51:22.269 --> 00:51:23.569
What did you say to him?

00:51:24.969 --> 00:51:26.969
What reason did Dad give for saying no?

00:51:28.969 --> 00:51:29.969
It's just...

00:51:35.549 --> 00:51:37.509
What did Dad say while he was crying?

00:51:39.549 --> 00:51:40.549
Was your father crying?

00:51:42.449 --> 00:51:44.219
You didn't even know my dad cried?

00:51:49.629 --> 00:51:51.359
You weren't there to get his blessing.

00:51:53.629 --> 00:51:55.899
Please, just tell me.

00:51:56.829 --> 00:51:59.669
This is about my dad, so I have a right to know, don't I?

00:51:59.869 --> 00:52:02.939
Did Dad tell you not to tell me? Did he ask you to keep it a secret?

00:52:07.209 --> 00:52:10.749
If you're not going to tell me, then I'll go ask him myself.

00:52:11.449 --> 00:52:14.079
If something's wrong with Dad, Mom has to know.

00:52:15.089 --> 00:52:16.089
Your mother?

00:52:19.919 --> 00:52:21.429
Okay, Su Bin.

00:52:24.959 --> 00:52:26.599
You're good at keeping promises, right?

00:52:27.899 --> 00:52:29.529
If you say you won't say anything, you won't.

00:52:30.229 --> 00:52:32.399
And if you promise to break up with someone, you do it, right?

00:52:34.339 --> 00:52:35.909
You won't waver.

00:52:37.269 --> 00:52:38.609
And you can handle this, right?

00:52:41.179 --> 00:52:42.849
Yes. I can.

00:52:46.679 --> 00:52:47.749
It's not your father.

00:52:49.949 --> 00:52:50.959
It's Ji Hyuk.

00:52:52.919 --> 00:52:55.359
Ji Hyuk's the one who's sick, Su Bin.

00:52:58.159 --> 00:52:59.159
What?

00:53:03.829 --> 00:53:04.839
Honey.

00:53:05.169 --> 00:53:06.999
- Have some fruit. - I don't want any.

00:53:07.269 --> 00:53:09.539
Dad, come on. Have some with me.

00:53:12.179 --> 00:53:13.179
All right.

00:53:15.049 --> 00:53:16.579
Hey, what's with you?

00:53:16.649 --> 00:53:18.819
You listen to Ji Hyuk more than you listen to me.

00:53:22.619 --> 00:53:24.659
Roasted sweet potatoes are here!

00:53:25.619 --> 00:53:28.729
Hey, what's this? They still sell sweet potatoes?

00:53:28.759 --> 00:53:31.259
Didn't you know? Before you get to the main road,

00:53:31.329 --> 00:53:34.869
a guy comes on Wednesdays and Sundays. He's there every year.

00:53:35.069 --> 00:53:37.199
Really? I had no idea.

00:53:38.199 --> 00:53:40.099
What are you doing out so late?

00:53:40.569 --> 00:53:43.309
You haven't been seeing Seong Jae again, have you?

00:53:43.709 --> 00:53:46.909
No, Mom. If you can't even trust your own daughter,

00:53:47.209 --> 00:53:49.049
I might as well just go see him for real.

00:53:50.249 --> 00:53:51.719
I'm just worried about you.

00:53:52.079 --> 00:53:54.919
If you're so worried, then stop bringing up Seong Jae.

00:53:55.119 --> 00:53:56.489
You're just making me miss him.

00:54:00.519 --> 00:54:02.459
(Take pill)

00:54:02.529 --> 00:54:05.499
Shoot. I just remembered I have something to do.

00:54:05.559 --> 00:54:09.469
Okay. Go on upstairs and work. I'll bring you up some coffee.

00:54:10.499 --> 00:54:12.139
He can't have coffee.

00:54:12.699 --> 00:54:16.109
No, that's all right. I'll just grab a glass of water.

00:54:17.409 --> 00:54:20.279
Ji Hyuk, I'll bring it up with some sweet potatoes.

00:54:20.709 --> 00:54:23.309
It's a good excuse to escape Mom's nagging.

00:54:24.749 --> 00:54:26.279
Sure, thanks. I appreciate it.

00:54:31.989 --> 00:54:36.129
Su Bin, no way. What's all this? Why the royal treatment?

00:54:36.959 --> 00:54:38.059
No reason.

00:54:38.459 --> 00:54:41.029
You're working so hard after taking over the company,

00:54:41.429 --> 00:54:43.069
and I realized I've been kind of thoughtless.

00:54:45.269 --> 00:54:46.999
My little sister, I'm touched.

00:54:48.239 --> 00:54:51.039
But you must be going through a lot with Seong Jae.

00:54:52.779 --> 00:54:53.779
Su Bin.

00:54:54.479 --> 00:54:55.579
Things have been tough lately, haven't they?

00:54:57.749 --> 00:54:59.279
Tough? What are you talking about?

00:55:01.949 --> 00:55:04.859
I'm completely over it, so take your time and eat.

00:55:05.989 --> 00:55:07.489
- Get some rest. - Okay.

00:55:14.229 --> 00:55:15.769
She's just putting on a brave face.

00:55:16.999 --> 00:55:18.339
How could she not be hurting?

00:55:19.839 --> 00:55:22.169
It's hard enough for me just thinking about Eun Oh.

00:55:33.049 --> 00:55:34.789
Poor Ji Hyuk.

00:56:01.309 --> 00:56:03.379
- I'm off. - Okay. Have a good day.

00:56:18.999 --> 00:56:21.299
Father, shall we go?

00:56:22.129 --> 00:56:24.169
Sure, let's go.

00:56:29.909 --> 00:56:32.079
The CEO isn't in yet.

00:56:32.409 --> 00:56:34.009
He isn't?

00:56:39.619 --> 00:56:42.589
He's been taking some kind of medicine lately.

00:56:53.699 --> 00:56:54.999
Excuse me, Mr. Cha.

00:56:55.669 --> 00:56:59.169
I need his approval on something for the Life 30 project.

00:56:59.699 --> 00:57:02.209
Do you know what time the CEO's doctor's appointment is today?

00:57:05.339 --> 00:57:06.339
A doctor's appointment?

00:57:08.179 --> 00:57:09.949
He's been taking medicine constantly.

00:57:15.019 --> 00:57:16.019
Has he?

00:57:23.359 --> 00:57:24.859
I'm sure this is a lot to take in.

00:57:26.629 --> 00:57:27.629
It is.

00:57:29.169 --> 00:57:31.369
Is there anything in particular you'd like to know?

00:57:31.799 --> 00:57:32.869
Please, ask.

00:57:33.869 --> 00:57:37.369
My son told me some of it,

00:57:37.869 --> 00:57:39.739
and I've also done my own research online.

00:57:40.179 --> 00:57:43.209
So I have a general idea of what dilated cardiomyopathy is,

00:57:43.709 --> 00:57:45.349
and what his current condition is.

00:57:45.949 --> 00:57:47.749
I understand the basics.

00:57:48.419 --> 00:57:49.419
In that case...

00:57:51.459 --> 00:57:56.129
Can you tell me how many people are ahead of him on the waitlist?

00:57:56.429 --> 00:57:59.959
And what about an artificial heart? Is that an option?

00:58:05.569 --> 00:58:07.139
For a heart transplant,

00:58:07.569 --> 00:58:10.139
it has to be a living heart from a brain-dead donor.

00:58:11.809 --> 00:58:15.079
That's why it's hard to give you a precise number on the waitlist.

00:58:16.509 --> 00:58:18.549
The patient's condition is also a factor.

00:58:25.659 --> 00:58:26.989
Realistically speaking,

00:58:27.719 --> 00:58:29.759
the situation isn't promising.

00:59:00.189 --> 00:59:02.589
Your numbers haven't changed much.

00:59:03.989 --> 00:59:05.799
You've been taking your medication, correct?

00:59:06.599 --> 00:59:07.599
Yes.

00:59:08.899 --> 00:59:10.169
My father...

00:59:11.169 --> 00:59:12.369
Did he seem to understand everything?

00:59:13.539 --> 00:59:14.539
Yes.

00:59:27.419 --> 00:59:28.419
Ji Hyuk.

00:59:29.619 --> 00:59:30.619
Let's go.

00:59:31.689 --> 00:59:32.689
Sure.

00:59:42.099 --> 00:59:43.569
It's like trying to catch a stroke of luck...

00:59:44.299 --> 00:59:46.069
that may never come.

00:59:47.839 --> 00:59:51.239
He said the only way is to wait for a stranger's heart.

00:59:52.079 --> 00:59:53.079
That's right.

00:59:53.639 --> 00:59:56.049
But still, let's not lose hope.

00:59:57.209 --> 00:59:58.219
I just...

00:59:59.449 --> 01:00:03.119
I don't want you to live your life...

01:00:03.189 --> 01:00:05.189
as if you're just checking items off a bucket list,

01:00:07.059 --> 01:00:09.089
as if you've already accepted the end.

01:00:09.629 --> 01:00:11.289
This sense of responsibility for the company,

01:00:11.999 --> 01:00:13.559
or any regrets you have about our family.

01:00:14.999 --> 01:00:16.069
Things like that.

01:00:17.099 --> 01:00:18.669
I hope you can let it all go.

01:00:21.299 --> 01:00:22.709
It's not like that.

01:00:24.069 --> 01:00:25.109
I just...

01:00:25.609 --> 01:00:27.079
want to live a normal life.

01:00:29.749 --> 01:00:30.749
I see.

01:00:31.579 --> 01:00:32.779
Well, that's a relief.

01:00:35.119 --> 01:00:36.289
Thanks, Dad.

01:00:39.819 --> 01:00:42.129
You thank me for the silliest things.

01:00:43.189 --> 01:00:44.359
Go on, head to work.

01:01:12.459 --> 01:01:14.419
You could've at least waited for me to answer.

01:01:14.689 --> 01:01:15.729
Has he?

01:01:33.139 --> 01:01:34.179

01:01:42.349 --> 01:01:45.359
Hey, Yeon Ju. I just sent you a photo.

01:01:45.719 --> 01:01:47.559
Can you find out what this medication is for?

01:01:49.459 --> 01:01:51.459
Okay, great. Thanks, I appreciate it.

(Certificate of All Registered Matters - Condominium)

01:02:05.939 --> 01:02:09.249
Of the seven collateral mortgages, I didn't consent to a single one.

01:02:09.709 --> 01:02:12.919
So your husband really forged your seal...

01:02:12.979 --> 01:02:14.419
and did all this?

01:02:15.319 --> 01:02:18.419
All seven properties were mortgaged on the same day.

01:02:18.919 --> 01:02:21.859
And I got no money in my account from Park Jin Seok.

01:02:22.859 --> 01:02:25.629
I never once gave him my ID or my official seal.

01:02:27.799 --> 01:02:31.129
You said he was insanely jealous, but this is on another level.

01:02:31.669 --> 01:02:34.169
I told him I wanted a divorce as I couldn't stand his jealousy.

01:02:34.939 --> 01:02:36.309
So he decided to trap me.

01:02:40.539 --> 01:02:42.909
So you want to file a lawsuit to contest all of these?

01:02:45.819 --> 01:02:48.449
(Certificate of All Registered Matters)

01:02:50.319 --> 01:02:52.919
Except for these two. They were anniversary gifts.

01:02:53.259 --> 01:02:56.859
I just want to get back the assets I've built up on my own.

01:02:57.829 --> 01:03:00.459
Most people in your position would want to fight for these too.

01:03:05.499 --> 01:03:06.599
How about it?

01:03:07.069 --> 01:03:08.739
Would you like to retain me today?

01:03:11.979 --> 01:03:13.509
I can't afford the retainer fee.

01:03:14.839 --> 01:03:17.579
- Pardon? - I told you before.

01:03:18.449 --> 01:03:21.149
He hid everything, the gold bars, the cash, all of it.

01:03:22.519 --> 01:03:24.919
In that case, I'm afraid I can't take your case.

01:03:25.889 --> 01:03:27.559
What if you get paid after we win?

01:03:28.459 --> 01:03:30.989
I'll give you a 20 percent contingency fee.

01:03:31.899 --> 01:03:35.369
Their total value, minus deposits, is over 40 million dollars.

01:03:35.799 --> 01:03:37.229
Then the contingency fee would be...

01:03:37.569 --> 01:03:38.699
Eight million dollars.

(Attorney Han Seong Ju)

Isn't this an open-and-shut case to invalidate collateral mortgage?

01:03:48.379 --> 01:03:51.979
Once we're in court, we'll have access to the CCTV.

01:03:52.049 --> 01:03:53.679
It'll show who used my Power of Attorney.

01:03:53.949 --> 01:03:56.019
And there's no record of any money being deposited into my account.

01:03:56.319 --> 01:03:58.889
Plus, most importantly, I'll be testifying.

01:04:02.759 --> 01:04:04.999
Are you saying you don't think you can win?

01:04:05.159 --> 01:04:07.329
No, it's not that, it's just...

01:04:07.929 --> 01:04:11.069
I know my offer is unconventional, Counselor.

01:04:11.869 --> 01:04:13.799
So please, take some time to think it over.

01:04:14.069 --> 01:04:15.639
Say, five minutes?

01:04:16.109 --> 01:04:17.509
That should be enough time, don't you think?

01:04:18.379 --> 01:04:21.339
If you say no, I have a meeting with another lawyer to get to.

(Yeon Ju)

01:04:31.689 --> 01:04:33.389
Hey, Yeon Ju. What is the medicine for?

01:04:36.129 --> 01:04:37.159
What?

01:04:52.239 --> 01:04:54.479
If we can draw up a contract for a 20 percent contingency fee,

01:04:54.679 --> 01:04:55.749
I'll take the case.

01:04:59.419 --> 01:05:01.989
If we win this lawsuit to invalidate collateral mortgage,

01:05:02.149 --> 01:05:05.489
can we use it to file for a divorce lawsuit as well?

01:05:05.589 --> 01:05:07.759
Of course. This will establish that your husband is the at-fault party.

01:05:08.659 --> 01:05:12.259
Then I'd like you to handle the divorce lawsuit too, Mr. Han.

01:05:13.059 --> 01:05:14.529
Since you already know all the details.

01:05:14.799 --> 01:05:18.569
Of course. It's to your advantage to have me handle the divorce too.

01:05:19.699 --> 01:05:21.099
Then...

01:05:21.369 --> 01:05:22.509
Let's draw up the contract right now.

01:05:23.539 --> 01:05:27.139
Since your husband threatened you, I'll add a confidentiality clause.

01:05:28.109 --> 01:05:32.319
So when can you file the complaint? The sooner the better.

01:05:32.749 --> 01:05:37.349
I'll need a marriage certificate, your recorded statement,

01:05:37.419 --> 01:05:40.289
and bank statements with no actual monetary transactions.

01:05:40.359 --> 01:05:41.559
Then we can file the complaint right away.

01:05:43.159 --> 01:05:45.029
That's quite a lot to prepare.

01:05:47.459 --> 01:05:49.029
How about this, Mr. Han?

01:05:49.929 --> 01:05:52.939

01:06:43.319 --> 01:06:45.189
You're clearly backed into a corner now.

01:06:45.359 --> 01:06:47.119
We can do that right away, can't we?

01:06:47.359 --> 01:06:49.689
If we can pull that off... But will it really work?

01:06:49.759 --> 01:06:51.429
Give me 200,000 dollars from the money I gave you.

01:06:51.429 --> 01:06:52.829
It's your responsibility.

01:06:52.899 --> 01:06:54.359
Hey, Ji Eun Oh!

01:06:54.459 --> 01:06:57.799
Of all people, why did it have to be Ji Hyuk? Please, just save him.

01:06:57.869 --> 01:07:00.869
Please, just save him. I'm begging you.
