WEBVTT

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:49.960
Let's go. Let's go.

00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:51.440
Stay still. Come with me.

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:52.440
I...

00:01:52.440 --> 00:01:53.720
Brother

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:55.000
Calm down.

00:01:59.240 --> 00:02:01.000
What should we do?

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:02.960
Lord Xu.

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:05.640
That girl was kidnapped.

00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:08.520
Where did they go?

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:09.720
To the tavern.

00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:24.800
Boss, please catch the fish.

00:02:41.240 --> 00:02:43.360
Have a safe trip.

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:47.520
Wish you good luck.

00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:50.850
Great fortune. Great fortune.

00:03:16.079 --> 00:03:17.480
Well...

00:03:18.960 --> 00:03:20.240
You...

00:03:23.079 --> 00:03:24.680
On our wedding day,

00:03:25.240 --> 00:03:27.520
River God was missing and couldn't be found.

00:03:27.520 --> 00:03:30.640
But the Lucky Carp Alliance can't live without a sacred object.

00:03:30.640 --> 00:03:32.770
So I reprimanded a huge amount of money

00:03:32.920 --> 00:03:36.240
to make this glazed colorful carp statue.

00:03:36.760 --> 00:03:38.620
Whenever something big happens,

00:03:38.680 --> 00:03:40.079
we will catch fish

00:03:40.240 --> 00:03:42.200
God of River, please bless us.

00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:45.640
Fishing.

00:03:48.079 --> 00:03:50.520
Zheng, I've been looking for you

00:03:50.640 --> 00:03:52.400
I've been looking for you.

00:03:52.800 --> 00:03:56.480
And I'm trying my best to build the Lucky Carp Alliance.

00:03:56.800 --> 00:03:58.760
I hope the spirit of the Lucky Carp Alliance

00:03:58.760 --> 00:04:00.360
can spread across the world.

00:04:00.520 --> 00:04:03.520
All these years, I've saved up some hard-earned money

00:04:03.560 --> 00:04:04.640
It's enough for us

00:04:05.520 --> 00:04:07.520
and our future children.

00:04:07.560 --> 00:04:09.040
for our future child.

00:04:09.640 --> 00:04:10.760
And now,

00:04:10.920 --> 00:04:13.800
my business to Chang'an.

00:04:14.240 --> 00:04:16.700
It's a high-ranking and powerful position.

00:04:17.120 --> 00:04:21.120
But I still remember our engagement.

00:04:21.959 --> 00:04:23.120
I am

00:04:23.360 --> 00:04:25.040
I am an upright

00:04:25.240 --> 00:04:26.880
and cares about the world.

00:04:27.640 --> 00:04:28.440
So...

00:04:33.640 --> 00:04:34.320
Zheng.

00:04:34.800 --> 00:04:36.200
I propose to you

00:04:36.320 --> 00:04:38.120
officially propose to you.

00:04:39.200 --> 00:04:40.200
I...

00:04:41.520 --> 00:04:43.760
I hope you will obey your parents' orders.

00:04:43.760 --> 00:04:45.159
The matchmaker's words.

00:04:45.200 --> 00:04:47.760
Be my wife.

00:04:47.960 --> 00:04:48.890
Are you willing?

00:04:50.440 --> 00:04:52.000
a high-ranking and powerful man?

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:53.320
and upright.

00:04:53.320 --> 00:04:54.640
He has a great waist.

00:04:54.640 --> 00:04:56.120
Handsome

00:04:57.960 --> 00:05:00.000
Handsome.

00:05:02.440 --> 00:05:04.120
I didn't say I'm handsome.

00:05:04.200 --> 00:05:04.680
Yes.

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:07.080
I do look ordinary.

00:05:08.640 --> 00:05:11.440
God, are you playing me again?

00:05:11.880 --> 00:05:12.760
Xiao Zheng.

00:05:13.320 --> 00:05:14.880
I really mean it.

00:05:17.120 --> 00:05:17.880
Then...

00:05:20.760 --> 00:05:21.800
One more time.

00:05:23.560 --> 00:05:24.160
Forget it.

00:05:26.560 --> 00:05:27.360
Who are you?

00:05:27.680 --> 00:05:28.640
Who are you?

00:05:29.120 --> 00:05:30.120
Can't you see?

00:05:30.440 --> 00:05:31.840
My brother is proposing.

00:05:36.960 --> 00:05:37.560
Proposal?

00:05:46.560 --> 00:05:47.800
Chief Zhang, right?

00:05:49.120 --> 00:05:50.580
Do we know each other well?

00:05:52.680 --> 00:05:55.320
We've only met twice.

00:05:55.680 --> 00:05:57.010
You call this familiar?

00:05:57.800 --> 00:05:58.200
Xiao Zheng.

00:05:58.200 --> 00:05:59.930
We get to know each other again.

00:06:00.560 --> 00:06:02.080
The first time we met, he bowed to me.

00:06:02.080 --> 00:06:03.880
The second time we met, you proposed to me.

00:06:03.880 --> 00:06:05.760
You have no requirements for marriage.

00:06:05.760 --> 00:06:06.680
and your future wife

00:06:06.680 --> 00:06:08.520
to your future wife?

00:06:08.760 --> 00:06:10.680
And do you know me?

00:06:11.120 --> 00:06:13.360
Besides, men have gold on their knees.

00:06:13.560 --> 00:06:14.760
so easily?

00:06:14.880 --> 00:06:17.640
Or do you think

00:06:17.760 --> 00:06:19.360
you're cute.

00:06:21.080 --> 00:06:21.680
Boss.

00:06:21.880 --> 00:06:23.120
I'm running away.

00:06:23.120 --> 00:06:24.200
What are you doing?

00:06:24.680 --> 00:06:26.010
You're proposing to me.

00:06:26.120 --> 00:06:27.360
You want to be with me?

00:06:27.560 --> 00:06:29.880
Are you stupid or taking advantage of me?

00:06:29.880 --> 00:06:30.440
Zheng.

00:06:30.440 --> 00:06:33.320
Why does she sound like she's talking about me?

00:06:33.440 --> 00:06:34.880
I will protect you.

00:06:34.880 --> 00:06:36.610
You're taking advantage of me.

00:06:36.880 --> 00:06:39.560
What if I really have no choice but to say yes?

00:06:39.880 --> 00:06:40.880
Isn't that good?

00:06:40.880 --> 00:06:42.000
Good for you.

00:06:42.440 --> 00:06:44.640
Because I promised you,

00:06:44.640 --> 00:06:46.880
But we don't know each other at all.

00:06:47.080 --> 00:06:48.560
We were together because of our impulse.

00:06:48.560 --> 00:06:51.020
In the end, you are not the one I want to marry.

00:06:51.320 --> 00:06:53.240
No love, no future.

00:06:53.520 --> 00:06:55.650
Do you know what will happen in the end?

00:06:56.520 --> 00:06:57.320
I'll die.

00:06:58.560 --> 00:06:59.360
I'll die.

00:06:59.560 --> 00:07:01.890
Understand? I don't want to see you again.

00:07:03.360 --> 00:07:04.760
Zheng!

00:07:05.240 --> 00:07:05.760
Brother

00:07:06.080 --> 00:07:08.440
Be careful.

00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:10.960
My waist.

00:07:11.440 --> 00:07:13.120
Why is she leaving again?

00:07:16.360 --> 00:07:17.240
Look.

00:07:18.080 --> 00:07:19.520
She said she's going to choose the Oiran.

00:07:19.520 --> 00:07:20.560
Famous prostitute?

00:07:20.560 --> 00:07:21.760
Yes, let me see.

00:07:25.120 --> 00:07:26.200
Yes, then...

00:07:28.560 --> 00:07:29.760
What are they doing?

00:07:31.360 --> 00:07:32.890
Pick the Oiran on the stage.

00:07:35.080 --> 00:07:36.320
Famous prostitute!

00:07:37.440 --> 00:07:38.240
Famous prostitute?

00:07:38.240 --> 00:07:41.120
It represents wealth and beauty

00:07:41.200 --> 00:07:42.530
and beauty in Chang'an.

00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:44.460
The girl who wins the Oiran

00:07:44.560 --> 00:07:46.640
will not only get a certain reputation,

00:07:46.640 --> 00:07:48.520
but also be favored

00:07:48.520 --> 00:07:49.760
in Chang'an.

00:07:50.200 --> 00:07:52.760
Gu Jin'er has been the Oiran for three consecutive years.

00:07:52.760 --> 00:07:53.760
No one in Chang'an

00:07:53.760 --> 00:07:55.000
in Chang'an.

00:07:56.000 --> 00:07:59.200
Since choosing a husband is so complicated,

00:07:59.880 --> 00:08:02.760
it's better to focus on your career.

00:08:03.120 --> 00:08:04.360
If I become the Oiran,

00:08:04.680 --> 00:08:06.320
I might make a lot of money.

00:08:06.680 --> 00:08:09.140
Then you can become the richest woman first.

00:08:09.200 --> 00:08:10.000
How?

00:08:10.080 --> 00:08:10.960
What are you doing?

00:08:10.960 --> 00:08:12.200
To choose the Oiran.

00:08:12.760 --> 00:08:14.200
What will you sign up for?

00:08:14.960 --> 00:08:16.200
Are you going to say it or not?

00:08:16.200 --> 00:08:16.680
I...

00:08:19.080 --> 00:08:21.140
Ping Kang Fang is looking for Mr. Xue.

00:08:21.680 --> 00:08:22.800
Where are you going?

00:08:22.800 --> 00:08:23.760
Don't follow me.

00:08:23.960 --> 00:08:26.560
I'm going to do something women do.

00:08:31.640 --> 00:08:33.120
Five, six.

00:08:33.120 --> 00:08:33.760
Coach Xue.

00:08:33.760 --> 00:08:35.320
Seven, eight.

00:08:35.960 --> 00:08:36.600
Three, two.

00:08:36.600 --> 00:08:37.320
Coach Xue.

00:08:38.559 --> 00:08:39.440
Come on.

00:08:41.200 --> 00:08:42.960
Why are you pulling me?

00:08:43.799 --> 00:08:45.320
I want to run for the Oiran.

00:08:49.200 --> 00:08:49.800
You...

00:08:50.960 --> 00:08:51.800
be the Oiran.

00:08:55.560 --> 00:08:56.890
Are you out of your mind?

00:08:57.080 --> 00:08:59.480
Don't waste the registration.

00:08:59.960 --> 00:09:01.020
Registration fee.

00:09:01.720 --> 00:09:02.800
How much is that?

00:09:09.320 --> 00:09:10.440
How much?

00:09:11.960 --> 00:09:14.600
That's a lot of money.

00:09:27.480 --> 00:09:28.610
I'll take the money.

00:09:28.800 --> 00:09:29.800
I won't return it.

00:09:30.040 --> 00:09:31.160
Deal.

00:09:31.320 --> 00:09:32.280
I won't go back on my word.

00:09:32.280 --> 00:09:33.280
I won't let you go.

00:09:33.400 --> 00:09:33.930
Goodbye.

00:09:34.080 --> 00:09:34.840
Bye.

00:09:49.720 --> 00:09:52.160
Brother Xu, you're so nice.

00:09:52.800 --> 00:09:53.720
Who is it?

00:09:54.080 --> 00:09:55.040
You're early.

00:09:55.800 --> 00:09:57.060
Where is Hua Xiaoqiao?

00:09:58.200 --> 00:09:59.060
Hua Xiao Zheng.

00:10:00.720 --> 00:10:01.600
Honey.

00:10:01.600 --> 00:10:02.660
Brother! Brother!

00:10:02.920 --> 00:10:03.600
Honey.

00:10:06.080 --> 00:10:06.600
Sit.

00:10:06.960 --> 00:10:07.840
Honey.

00:10:11.600 --> 00:10:14.130
I’m the chairman of Anle Chamber of Commerce.

00:10:14.680 --> 00:10:15.320
Excuse me.

00:10:16.040 --> 00:10:17.040
Who is he?

00:10:17.560 --> 00:10:19.090
Chief of the Carp Alliance.

00:10:19.200 --> 00:10:20.040
Mr. Zhang.

00:10:20.560 --> 00:10:21.560
Yes, I am.

00:10:23.560 --> 00:10:24.600
Director Zhang,

00:10:25.280 --> 00:10:26.680
why are you here?

00:10:30.200 --> 00:10:32.320
I drove my wife

00:10:33.040 --> 00:10:34.080
pissed off.

00:10:35.200 --> 00:10:37.400
Brother Xu is comforting me.

00:10:37.600 --> 00:10:40.040
Brother Xu is a good man.

00:10:40.320 --> 00:10:43.320
He's not like the rumors.

00:10:43.440 --> 00:10:44.960
What King of Hell?

00:10:44.960 --> 00:10:45.960
Nonsense.

00:10:47.080 --> 00:10:47.680
Ziqi.

00:10:48.440 --> 00:10:49.480
Who is his wife?

00:10:53.960 --> 00:10:56.600
Hua Xiao Zheng.

00:10:57.560 --> 00:10:59.020
Hua Xiao Zheng is his wife.

00:10:59.080 --> 00:11:00.320
When did she get married?

00:11:00.320 --> 00:11:00.720
She...

00:11:01.320 --> 00:11:03.200
Why did she get married?

00:11:05.040 --> 00:11:06.400
She's not married yet.

00:11:06.800 --> 00:11:09.080
He proposed and didn't agree.

00:11:09.480 --> 00:11:11.080
He pissed Hua Xiao Zheng off.

00:11:12.040 --> 00:11:13.400
He will marry him.

00:11:14.600 --> 00:11:15.440
I will.

00:11:17.680 --> 00:11:20.340
Master Zhang, how do you know you will marry him?

00:11:20.800 --> 00:11:22.960
Hua Xiao Zheng and I...

00:11:23.440 --> 00:11:26.040
It's the order of parents and matchmakers.

00:11:26.680 --> 00:11:29.280
It’s natural.

00:11:31.680 --> 00:11:32.840
Leader Zhang,

00:11:33.080 --> 00:11:34.480
I have to tell you

00:11:34.480 --> 00:11:37.440
about the marriage law of Tang.

00:11:38.560 --> 00:11:40.160
The words of matchmakers

00:11:40.160 --> 00:11:43.160
only verbal promises are useless.

00:11:43.400 --> 00:11:45.200
It has to be written

00:11:45.200 --> 00:11:49.080
clearly.

00:11:55.200 --> 00:11:56.080
What is this?

00:11:58.440 --> 00:11:59.440
It's upside down.

00:12:03.200 --> 00:12:06.920
Zhang Jiagui has been friendly with the Hua family for generations.

00:12:06.920 --> 00:12:09.800
Both parties voluntarily and their parents agreed

00:12:10.080 --> 00:12:12.080
and their parents' consent.

00:12:12.080 --> 00:12:14.040
Tie the red rope tightly.

00:12:18.480 --> 00:12:19.680
Is it legal?

00:12:20.960 --> 00:12:23.280
It can't be legal anymore.

00:12:23.280 --> 00:12:23.680
Yes.

00:12:24.600 --> 00:12:27.080
If Hua Xiao Zheng doesn't marry him,

00:12:27.320 --> 00:12:28.680
she will be sentenced to

00:12:29.440 --> 00:12:31.080
run away from marriage.

00:12:32.320 --> 00:12:33.200
Brother.

00:12:34.320 --> 00:12:37.840
How can I sue my wife?

00:12:38.560 --> 00:12:39.200
Am I right?

00:12:40.280 --> 00:12:41.840
As a man,

00:12:46.960 --> 00:12:48.800
Director Zhang,

00:12:49.160 --> 00:12:50.420
I have something to do.

00:12:50.680 --> 00:12:51.560
Excuse me.

00:12:51.800 --> 00:12:52.600
Li.

00:12:52.720 --> 00:12:53.200
Go ahead.

00:12:53.200 --> 00:12:55.600
Aren't you going to have another drink?

00:12:55.960 --> 00:12:57.160
I'll come back later.

00:12:57.800 --> 00:12:58.440
Come back.

00:12:59.800 --> 00:13:00.320
Okay.

00:13:00.560 --> 00:13:01.160
Brother.

00:13:02.960 --> 00:13:03.440
Keep drinking.

00:13:03.440 --> 00:13:04.920
Zhang Gui has checked

00:13:05.400 --> 00:13:06.080
Are you...

00:13:06.280 --> 00:13:07.200
A good person?

00:13:07.960 --> 00:13:08.680
When?

00:13:08.680 --> 00:13:09.200
Now

00:13:09.680 --> 00:13:10.320
Now

00:13:10.920 --> 00:13:11.920
Calm down, my lord.

00:13:11.920 --> 00:13:13.200
He just said

00:13:13.200 --> 00:13:14.960
he's the leader of the Carp Alliance.

00:13:14.960 --> 00:13:16.960
There are so many people here.

00:13:16.960 --> 00:13:18.080
We should grow up.

00:13:19.280 --> 00:13:21.440
I also think it's not a good thing.

00:13:21.560 --> 00:13:22.200
But...

00:13:22.440 --> 00:13:23.040
I can't beat him.

00:13:23.040 --> 00:13:24.560
Is it good?

00:13:24.560 --> 00:13:25.560
I can't beat him.

00:13:26.960 --> 00:13:28.490
Let's think of another way.

00:13:29.440 --> 00:13:30.440
What is it?

00:13:30.680 --> 00:13:31.280
Kill him!

00:13:32.600 --> 00:13:33.800
My lord. My lord.

00:13:33.800 --> 00:13:34.400
Let's...

00:13:34.400 --> 00:13:35.040
Don't pull me.

00:13:35.040 --> 00:13:35.900
Think about it.

00:13:36.160 --> 00:13:38.200
I'll tell you if you can't drink.

00:13:38.680 --> 00:13:41.480
I'll help you today.

00:13:48.440 --> 00:13:51.480
I've arranged the registration for you.

00:13:52.200 --> 00:13:55.600
It's very clear in the register.

00:13:55.720 --> 00:13:57.960
You can go to the scene and confirm it now.

00:13:57.960 --> 00:13:59.840
The deadline is tomorrow.

00:14:01.680 --> 00:14:03.010
How to choose the Oiran?

00:14:03.320 --> 00:14:05.800
I need to be good at everything.

00:14:06.400 --> 00:14:08.080
What else do you think?

00:14:09.280 --> 00:14:12.160
Why didn't you tell me earlier?

00:14:12.400 --> 00:14:14.040
Why didn't I tell you earlier?

00:14:14.040 --> 00:14:15.100
I thought you knew.

00:14:15.960 --> 00:14:18.840
You don't know? Why are you here?

00:14:19.960 --> 00:14:23.080
Do I look like I know it?

00:14:25.080 --> 00:14:27.560
You have to work hard.

00:14:28.200 --> 00:14:29.200
Why?

00:14:30.080 --> 00:14:31.600
The Oiran Exam.

00:14:31.960 --> 00:14:34.560
I don't know how to do it.

00:14:36.680 --> 00:14:38.560
Registration fee is so expensive.

00:14:38.560 --> 00:14:39.360
Don't give up.

00:14:39.680 --> 00:14:40.440
Work hard.

00:14:44.560 --> 00:14:45.200
Well...

00:14:45.960 --> 00:14:46.800
Well...

00:14:50.440 --> 00:14:52.320
Can I return the application fee?

00:14:54.680 --> 00:14:55.480
Bye.

00:14:58.200 --> 00:14:58.800
I...

00:14:59.680 --> 00:15:01.400
My application fee.

00:15:04.080 --> 00:15:05.800
I've never seen

00:15:06.200 --> 00:15:08.800
I've never seen such a proper marriage letter.

00:15:10.400 --> 00:15:12.720
There's really no flaw.

00:15:12.960 --> 00:15:13.960
Strict stitches.

00:15:14.200 --> 00:15:14.960
and tight.

00:15:19.680 --> 00:15:20.480
I thought

00:15:21.200 --> 00:15:22.080
Hua Xiao Zheng is

00:15:22.080 --> 00:15:23.440
who has no family.

00:15:23.440 --> 00:15:23.960
Yes.

00:15:24.960 --> 00:15:27.080
I've been in this industry for so many years.

00:15:27.080 --> 00:15:28.160
Who would have thought...

00:15:28.160 --> 00:15:30.840
he was the number one gangster in Tang.

00:15:32.560 --> 00:15:34.090
I don't know where he is now.

00:15:34.480 --> 00:15:35.680
Is he still in Chang'an?

00:15:35.680 --> 00:15:37.080
What are you looking for?

00:15:37.080 --> 00:15:38.610
She's Jang Gui-jae's wife.

00:15:38.840 --> 00:15:39.840
What are we doing?

00:15:40.080 --> 00:15:41.440
Don't worry about it.

00:15:43.400 --> 00:15:44.960
But didn't you say

00:15:45.800 --> 00:15:47.320
she would rather die than obey?

00:15:47.320 --> 00:15:48.960
Is that something she never obeys?

00:15:48.960 --> 00:15:50.800
Even if Hua Xiao Zheng doesn't obey,

00:15:50.800 --> 00:15:52.400
the Tang Code will let her...

00:15:52.600 --> 00:15:53.480
From now on,

00:15:53.600 --> 00:15:54.560
all her problems

00:15:54.560 --> 00:15:56.200
to find Zhang Gui.

00:15:56.320 --> 00:15:58.920
I won't interfere anymore.

00:16:02.440 --> 00:16:03.080
My lord.

00:16:05.400 --> 00:16:07.200
This is the list of the Oiran selection this year.

00:16:07.200 --> 00:16:08.260
Please have a look.

00:16:13.520 --> 00:16:13.800
Yes.

00:16:26.720 --> 00:16:27.180
This...

00:16:29.040 --> 00:16:31.480
In order not to marry Zhang Gui Cai,

00:16:32.040 --> 00:16:33.500
to not marry Zhang Gui Cai.

00:16:35.200 --> 00:16:37.080
She's really something.

00:16:37.840 --> 00:16:40.100
Isn't she forcing me into prostitution?

00:16:43.920 --> 00:16:44.480
Li.

00:16:46.200 --> 00:16:46.730
Let's go.

00:16:46.960 --> 00:16:47.760
Find someone.

00:16:48.040 --> 00:16:48.960
Don't do this.

00:16:53.200 --> 00:16:53.960
This is mine.

00:17:00.560 --> 00:17:01.490
Okay, thank you.

00:17:04.560 --> 00:17:05.440
This is mine.

00:17:05.680 --> 00:17:06.800
You danced so well.

00:17:14.640 --> 00:17:15.200
Okay.

00:17:18.720 --> 00:17:19.040
Okay.

00:17:19.040 --> 00:17:21.520
It's so hard to be the Oiran.

00:17:27.280 --> 00:17:27.880
Alright.

00:17:40.640 --> 00:17:43.880
Please tell me the basic information again.

00:17:45.680 --> 00:17:47.600
Height 5.6 inches.

00:17:47.880 --> 00:17:49.640
Weight 105.

00:17:49.680 --> 00:17:50.960
Learning dancing at three.

00:17:50.960 --> 00:17:52.440
I learned pipa at four.

00:17:53.040 --> 00:17:54.600
Learning at five

00:17:54.880 --> 00:17:56.480
I learned flutes at six.

00:17:57.600 --> 00:18:01.720
I was seven years old. I learned flowers, tea, chess, calligraphy and painting.

00:18:01.720 --> 00:18:03.960
You can make Flying Flower Token at eight.

00:18:03.960 --> 00:18:06.490
When I was nine, my qin skills shook Chang'an.

00:18:06.960 --> 00:18:09.440
When I was ten, I danced and met you two.

00:18:10.880 --> 00:18:12.920
Now you're good at dancing and playing.

00:18:12.920 --> 00:18:14.200
in Chang'an.

00:18:15.400 --> 00:18:16.520
The Oiran

00:18:17.360 --> 00:18:21.200
It's been three years. It's been three years. It's been a while. It's been a while. It's been a while.

00:18:21.200 --> 00:18:22.400
Amazing.

00:18:22.440 --> 00:18:24.370
The light of all women in Chang'an.

00:18:25.680 --> 00:18:26.920
Amazing.

00:18:27.720 --> 00:18:29.040
You are the queen.

00:18:29.040 --> 00:18:30.600
Be confident and shine.

00:18:41.400 --> 00:18:42.000
Miss.

00:18:43.160 --> 00:18:43.920
Miss.

00:18:44.960 --> 00:18:45.960
Who are you?

00:18:46.960 --> 00:18:49.920
I'm here to cancel the application fee.

00:18:50.520 --> 00:18:51.680
I knew it.

00:18:52.840 --> 00:18:54.040
Look at your small arms and legs.

00:18:54.040 --> 00:18:55.680
to run for the Oiran.

00:18:55.960 --> 00:18:58.090
Aren't you overestimating yourself?

00:18:58.360 --> 00:18:59.360
What's your name?

00:19:00.960 --> 00:19:01.840
Hua Xiaochi

00:19:02.720 --> 00:19:03.960
Hua Xiaotong.

00:19:05.680 --> 00:19:07.200
Cancel the Oiran.

00:19:07.200 --> 00:19:09.000
and pay ten times the penalty.

00:19:09.120 --> 00:19:10.440
A total of 1,000 taels of silver.

00:19:10.440 --> 00:19:11.370
Pay at the scene.

00:19:13.880 --> 00:19:14.760
1,000 taels.

00:19:15.480 --> 00:19:18.520
It costs 1,000 taels to cancel the registration.

00:19:21.520 --> 00:19:22.320
That's right.

00:19:25.160 --> 00:19:25.840
Excuse me.

00:19:50.920 --> 00:19:52.680
I want to cry.

00:19:53.680 --> 00:19:55.440
But I can't.

00:19:57.400 --> 00:20:01.200
Is this the feeling of crying without tears?

00:20:04.160 --> 00:20:08.440
The idioms are so wonderful.

00:20:10.720 --> 00:20:11.520
Come with us.

00:20:12.280 --> 00:20:13.240
Why are you leaving?

00:20:13.240 --> 00:20:14.840
Cancel the application now.

00:20:15.200 --> 00:20:17.000
Yes, cancel it now.

00:20:18.840 --> 00:20:20.200
I can't.

00:20:20.400 --> 00:20:21.840
Even if you don't become the Oiran,

00:20:21.840 --> 00:20:23.760
you don't have to marry Bachelor Zhang.

00:20:23.760 --> 00:20:24.360
Yes.

00:20:24.920 --> 00:20:26.280
Why didn't you tell me

00:20:26.440 --> 00:20:27.700
Why didn't you tell me?

00:20:28.880 --> 00:20:30.120
He didn't come to me.

00:20:30.440 --> 00:20:32.200
I forgot about the candidate.

00:20:32.200 --> 00:20:32.960
Candidate?

00:20:35.160 --> 00:20:36.840
I don't want to be the Oiran anymore.

00:20:36.840 --> 00:20:39.120
Please help me. Cancel it for me.

00:20:39.240 --> 00:20:40.200
Then cancel it.

00:20:41.680 --> 00:20:42.840
Cancel it!

00:20:43.040 --> 00:20:45.480
1,000 taels of silver for breach of contract.

00:20:45.480 --> 00:20:46.410
I'll pay for you.

00:20:50.160 --> 00:20:52.120
Mr. Bang and Mr. Xu are loyal.

00:20:52.280 --> 00:20:53.960
Since you don't want to be the Oiran,

00:20:53.960 --> 00:20:55.020
why did you sign up?

00:20:56.440 --> 00:20:57.370
You reminded me.

00:20:57.720 --> 00:21:00.120
I'm going to find that evil woman, Ms. Seol.

00:21:01.680 --> 00:21:02.540
I'll get going.

00:21:15.400 --> 00:21:16.200
My goodness.

00:21:16.880 --> 00:21:18.760
Are you buying flowers?

00:21:19.160 --> 00:21:19.890
My ancestor.

00:21:20.000 --> 00:21:21.530
I have something to ask you.

00:21:21.880 --> 00:21:25.480
The flower in the mirror, the moon in the water, the wine in the cup

00:21:25.640 --> 00:21:26.840
Dream man?

00:21:28.200 --> 00:21:29.960
No, I want to ask you something.

00:21:30.120 --> 00:21:31.440
Except the 16 words

00:21:31.440 --> 00:21:33.120
you said last time,

00:21:33.120 --> 00:21:35.960
other than the 16 words you said?

00:21:36.440 --> 00:21:37.970
Watching flowers in the fog

00:21:38.440 --> 00:21:39.960
Horses and flowers

00:21:40.200 --> 00:21:41.480
I'm confused.

00:21:41.720 --> 00:21:43.720
The iron tree blooms

00:21:43.960 --> 00:21:44.880
"Look at you." It's "Look at you."

00:21:44.880 --> 00:21:45.600
I want to say

00:21:45.600 --> 00:21:47.730
if there are flowers, it can be broken.

00:21:47.840 --> 00:21:50.720
Don't wait until the flowers fall apart.

00:21:51.520 --> 00:21:53.960
I'm looking for a husband, not a flower.

00:21:57.960 --> 00:21:58.760
What?

00:21:59.160 --> 00:21:59.920
Flower.

00:22:00.520 --> 00:22:01.360
[Flower]

00:22:02.960 --> 00:22:04.240
You mean

00:22:05.440 --> 00:22:07.760
to run for the Oiran?

00:22:11.520 --> 00:22:12.250
Where is she?

00:22:17.360 --> 00:22:18.600
The Oiran.

00:22:23.720 --> 00:22:25.450
I’ll take 1,000 taels of silver

00:22:25.760 --> 00:22:27.480
to the Chamber of Commerce tomorrow.

00:22:27.480 --> 00:22:29.140
I don’t need you to come again.

00:22:30.200 --> 00:22:31.960
I've been really shy lately.

00:22:33.120 --> 00:22:35.680
But it’s not appropriate

00:22:36.200 --> 00:22:37.400
to let you pay so much.

00:22:37.600 --> 00:22:38.600
It's not for free.

00:22:39.480 --> 00:22:41.120
I'll send her back to the mansion.

00:22:41.120 --> 00:22:43.440
and pay the debt for the rest of her life.

00:22:44.040 --> 00:22:44.520
Then...

00:22:45.920 --> 00:22:47.120
I'll pay half.

00:22:47.360 --> 00:22:48.440
Let this scourge

00:22:49.040 --> 00:22:50.960
to haunt you forever.

00:22:51.280 --> 00:22:52.210
It's killing me.

00:22:53.160 --> 00:22:54.880
If you ask me,

00:22:55.240 --> 00:22:57.960
if you want to give this money to that scoundrel,

00:22:58.280 --> 00:23:00.360
she will write down the IOU

00:23:00.960 --> 00:23:03.440
and write down how much she owes.

00:23:03.760 --> 00:23:06.020
How much should I pay back with interest?

00:23:06.160 --> 00:23:08.680
Otherwise, what should she do

00:23:09.200 --> 00:23:10.200
what should we do?

00:23:10.640 --> 00:23:11.840
Pay your debt.

00:23:12.120 --> 00:23:13.160
and marry you.

00:23:13.440 --> 00:23:14.880
You'll be rewarded. You'll be rewarded.

00:23:14.880 --> 00:23:15.240
Yes.

00:23:15.840 --> 00:23:17.960
We can use this to keep Hua

00:23:17.960 --> 00:23:18.960
Husppy is a genius

00:23:19.880 --> 00:23:21.000
What do you think?

00:23:22.160 --> 00:23:22.720
Sure.

00:23:23.400 --> 00:23:25.640
Let’s go home and withdraw the money.

00:23:25.720 --> 00:23:28.050
We’ll meet at Pingkang Fang at 7 tomorrow.

00:23:28.720 --> 00:23:29.720
Good.

00:23:30.280 --> 00:23:31.200
It's natural

00:23:31.440 --> 00:23:32.360
It's natural.

00:23:33.720 --> 00:23:34.360
My lord.

00:23:34.440 --> 00:23:37.500
I'm not asking her to sell herself to pay back the money.

00:23:53.280 --> 00:23:54.210
What's going on?

00:23:54.960 --> 00:23:56.160
I got bitten by a dog.

00:23:57.640 --> 00:24:00.920
But with the determination to run for the Oiran,

00:24:01.000 --> 00:24:03.160
to fight the fierce dog.

00:24:03.960 --> 00:24:06.760
I finally got the application form back.

00:24:10.680 --> 00:24:12.740
Didn't you say you'd quit yesterday?

00:24:13.600 --> 00:24:15.280
I realized it overnight.

00:24:15.840 --> 00:24:17.680
Famous prostitute is a good job.

00:24:17.920 --> 00:24:19.720
She has a bright future.

00:24:21.880 --> 00:24:22.960
The Oiran

00:24:25.400 --> 00:24:26.680
is indeed a good job.

00:24:28.240 --> 00:24:30.040
But you're basically a runner.

00:24:31.440 --> 00:24:32.400
It's okay.

00:24:32.600 --> 00:24:34.680
Young people should run and fight.

00:24:35.040 --> 00:24:36.960
Dreams are what they pursue.

00:24:37.000 --> 00:24:39.200
There's hope when there's a pursuit.

00:24:42.440 --> 00:24:44.240
Hua Xiaochi, what are you doing?

00:25:00.160 --> 00:25:01.020
Hua Xiao Zheng.

00:25:01.280 --> 00:25:02.720
Did you say

00:25:02.720 --> 00:25:04.040
to spend 1,000 taels of silver

00:25:04.040 --> 00:25:06.160
to cancel the competition for the Oiran.

00:25:06.160 --> 00:25:07.760
Why did you go back on your word?

00:25:07.760 --> 00:25:09.220
Are you talking nonsense?

00:25:15.000 --> 00:25:16.720
Ziqi

00:25:21.720 --> 00:25:22.400
Zheng.

00:25:22.880 --> 00:25:25.000
Do you know what the Oiran competition is about?

00:25:25.000 --> 00:25:26.240
Music, chess, calligraphy and painting.

00:25:26.240 --> 00:25:27.240
[Poems and poems, poems, and poems.] [Poems]

00:25:27.240 --> 00:25:28.240
I can learn

00:25:28.760 --> 00:25:29.760
I can learn.

00:25:30.240 --> 00:25:32.680
I can learn without eating or drinking.

00:25:33.120 --> 00:25:34.200
At least I tried.

00:25:34.440 --> 00:25:35.880
instead of giving up now.

00:25:37.120 --> 00:25:38.440
Other than these skills,

00:25:38.440 --> 00:25:39.960
they also have great wealth.

00:25:39.960 --> 00:25:42.420
The Oiran competition is about popularity.

00:25:42.520 --> 00:25:43.360
In terms of popularity,

00:25:43.360 --> 00:25:44.920
you can't beat Gu Jin'er.

00:25:46.520 --> 00:25:48.450
You need money to choose the Oiran.

00:25:48.960 --> 00:25:49.640
Could it be...

00:25:49.640 --> 00:25:53.170
The prices in Chang'an are rising and the people are suffering.

00:25:53.200 --> 00:25:54.360
Someone in the court

00:25:54.760 --> 00:25:58.240
joint hands with the chairman of the Chamber of Commerce of Commerce.

00:25:58.240 --> 00:26:01.520
This matter has sent many spies to investigate for years.

00:26:02.200 --> 00:26:06.920
but only found out that the mastermind is a relative of the royal family.

00:26:08.720 --> 00:26:09.520
Li,

00:26:10.440 --> 00:26:13.960
So Gu Jin'er has spent a lot of money

00:26:14.280 --> 00:26:17.280
the Chamber of Commerce must have spent a lot of money.

00:26:20.400 --> 00:26:22.880
Anyway, you can't afford so much money.

00:26:23.240 --> 00:26:25.480
And it's not easy to be the Oiran.

00:26:25.840 --> 00:26:26.760
Then tell me.

00:26:27.040 --> 00:26:28.170
How much do you need?

00:26:30.680 --> 00:26:31.740
It doesn't matter.

00:26:34.160 --> 00:26:36.880
As long as it's what my wife wants to do,

00:26:37.240 --> 00:26:39.960
I can afford any price.

00:26:42.680 --> 00:26:43.400
Xiao Zheng.

00:26:43.960 --> 00:26:44.640
Brother.

00:26:45.440 --> 00:26:46.160
Don't you go slower

00:26:46.160 --> 00:26:47.640
It's flashing.

00:26:49.840 --> 00:26:52.200
Madam is worried about me.

00:26:52.200 --> 00:26:52.730
Brother.

00:26:53.280 --> 00:26:53.920
Sit down.

00:26:54.200 --> 00:26:54.800
Slow down.

00:26:55.240 --> 00:26:55.600
Brother.

00:26:55.600 --> 00:26:57.060
You're talking nonsense.

00:26:57.360 --> 00:26:59.220
Don't blame me for beating you up.

00:27:05.920 --> 00:27:06.680
Zheng,

00:27:07.400 --> 00:27:09.960
Are you sure you want to run for the Oiran?

00:27:12.160 --> 00:27:13.360
To win the Oiran?

00:27:16.360 --> 00:27:17.040
Good.

00:27:17.680 --> 00:27:20.440
Even if I have to go bankrupt,

00:27:20.640 --> 00:27:22.960
to fulfill your wish.

00:27:23.680 --> 00:27:24.520
Why?

00:27:24.760 --> 00:27:25.880
We've only met

00:27:27.280 --> 00:27:28.600
three times.

00:27:31.160 --> 00:27:33.440
The first time we got married.

00:27:33.720 --> 00:27:35.380
The second time is a proposal.

00:27:35.640 --> 00:27:36.700
For the third time,

00:27:36.960 --> 00:27:39.090
Even if I have to do everything for you,

00:27:39.280 --> 00:27:40.960
it's reasonable.

00:27:41.960 --> 00:27:43.240
But why?

00:27:44.120 --> 00:27:46.720
Didn't you hear what Fang said?

00:27:47.040 --> 00:27:48.400
I need a lot of money.

00:27:50.680 --> 00:27:51.360
Yuanhan.

00:27:51.680 --> 00:27:52.210
Yes. Yes.

00:27:52.640 --> 00:27:53.400
Pass my order.

00:27:53.400 --> 00:27:56.160
Tell the nearest helm to prepare 10,000 taels of gold.

00:27:56.160 --> 00:27:58.960
If it’s not enough, ask other branches to prepare.

00:27:59.640 --> 00:28:00.120
Yes.

00:28:00.240 --> 00:28:01.640
Yes, sir! Yes, sir!

00:28:02.360 --> 00:28:02.960
That much?

00:28:05.600 --> 00:28:06.400
Excuse me.

00:28:08.200 --> 00:28:08.730
Let's go.

00:28:11.840 --> 00:28:14.200
I can't take your money.

00:28:14.720 --> 00:28:17.680
If I take it, it means I'll marry you.

00:28:19.440 --> 00:28:20.880
It doesn't matter.

00:28:21.440 --> 00:28:22.960
As long as you're happy,

00:28:23.120 --> 00:28:25.240
your dream is my dream.

00:28:25.440 --> 00:28:28.200
Your pursuit is my pursuit.

00:28:31.120 --> 00:28:32.360
Thank you.

00:28:40.920 --> 00:28:43.000
Kill him right now!

00:28:43.760 --> 00:28:45.290
Kill him if it doesn't work.

00:28:45.720 --> 00:28:48.450
Your Excellency, in order to find Hua Xiao Zheng,

00:28:48.480 --> 00:28:51.200
sent 1,000 members of the Carp Alliance to Chang'an.

00:28:51.200 --> 00:28:54.200
He has booked all the taverns.

00:28:54.600 --> 00:28:55.720
If we do it now,

00:28:56.000 --> 00:28:57.600
we'll catch a turtle in a jar.

00:29:05.280 --> 00:29:06.540
My lord, what's wrong?

00:29:06.960 --> 00:29:08.020
My chest is stuffy.

00:29:08.720 --> 00:29:09.680
It's so stuffy.

00:29:12.680 --> 00:29:13.540
Brother Zhang.

00:29:13.880 --> 00:29:15.880
How much did she spend in the Oiran Competition?

00:29:15.880 --> 00:29:18.040
Shouldn't she write it down?

00:29:18.520 --> 00:29:20.640
From the principal to the interest,

00:29:20.640 --> 00:29:22.160
You must remember it clearly.

00:29:22.160 --> 00:29:23.440
I'll pay you back.

00:29:24.480 --> 00:29:25.960
I'm fine.

00:29:26.160 --> 00:29:27.280
We're family.

00:29:27.480 --> 00:29:28.940
What's there to remember?

00:29:29.040 --> 00:29:31.120
Besides, she owes me a lot. Marry me.

00:29:33.520 --> 00:29:34.380
Hua Xiao Zheng.

00:29:35.960 --> 00:29:37.360
Don't you want a receipt?

00:29:38.640 --> 00:29:39.840
10,000 taels of gold.

00:29:40.680 --> 00:29:42.280
What if I can't pay you back?

00:29:45.880 --> 00:29:46.740
Hua Xiao Zheng.

00:29:47.040 --> 00:29:47.920
Sooner or later,

00:29:47.920 --> 00:29:49.440
on money one day.

00:29:49.640 --> 00:29:51.440
Someone will support me.

00:29:51.880 --> 00:29:52.880
Why are you angry?

00:29:53.000 --> 00:29:53.440
I...

00:29:54.960 --> 00:29:56.420
I don't want to talk to you.

00:29:56.720 --> 00:29:57.440
Brother Xu.

00:29:57.520 --> 00:29:58.240
Goodbye.

00:29:58.920 --> 00:29:59.780
Leave him alone

00:30:01.120 --> 00:30:03.680
Lord Li of the Ministry of Revenue donated 100,000 taels

00:30:03.680 --> 00:30:05.680
Total 10,000 taels of gold

00:30:06.200 --> 00:30:09.360
Governor Zhao of Ministry of Rites donated 100,000 votes

00:30:09.360 --> 00:30:10.360
Total of gold

00:30:10.840 --> 00:30:11.640
10,000 taels.

00:30:12.680 --> 00:30:15.360
Mr. Zhang of the Ministry of Personnel donated 100,000 votes.

00:30:15.360 --> 00:30:17.160
Stop reading. It's such a long list.

00:30:17.160 --> 00:30:19.240
The tea will be cold after you finish.

00:30:49.600 --> 00:30:51.440
Give a copy to Lord Wu.

00:30:52.360 --> 00:30:54.560
Jin'er won over 80,000 votes last year.

00:30:54.680 --> 00:30:56.680
We don't have to go too far this year.

00:30:57.440 --> 00:30:58.900
100,000 votes are enough.

00:30:59.160 --> 00:31:00.360
The rest of the tickets

00:31:00.360 --> 00:31:01.880
to Lord Wu.

00:31:02.680 --> 00:31:03.280
Yes.

00:31:11.400 --> 00:31:14.240
Did anything happen

00:31:14.440 --> 00:31:15.840
did anything wrong?

00:31:16.440 --> 00:31:17.770
They are all our people.

00:31:18.400 --> 00:31:20.360
There are 31 people in total.

00:31:20.880 --> 00:31:22.840
We have arranged 30 candidates.

00:31:23.680 --> 00:31:24.740
Except one person.

00:31:25.400 --> 00:31:26.000
Who is it?

00:31:26.760 --> 00:31:29.200
A woman from a farmhouse slave.

00:31:29.960 --> 00:31:30.680
Hua Xiaochi

00:31:31.160 --> 00:31:32.200
Hua Xiao Zheng.

00:31:32.880 --> 00:31:34.440
A slave from a farm

00:31:34.680 --> 00:31:36.000
won't be a big deal.

00:31:36.600 --> 00:31:38.460
I'm afraid she wants to be famous.

00:31:39.480 --> 00:31:40.480
Let her be.

00:31:43.040 --> 00:31:44.440
The power behind her

00:31:44.880 --> 00:31:46.720
is the Lucky Carp Alliance.

00:31:51.360 --> 00:31:52.200
Please calm down.

00:31:52.200 --> 00:31:54.160
The person recommended by the Koi Alliance

00:31:54.160 --> 00:31:56.360
If you ruin the election,

00:31:57.360 --> 00:31:59.000
I'll see how you'll compensate.

00:31:59.000 --> 00:32:00.060
Calm down, my lord.

00:32:00.200 --> 00:32:02.200
What's wrong with the Koi Alliance?

00:32:02.600 --> 00:32:05.800
Does the Koi Alliance dare to fight with court officials?

00:32:06.480 --> 00:32:08.240
We don't know

00:32:08.920 --> 00:32:10.250
who will help in the end.

00:32:11.680 --> 00:32:14.540
Keep an eye on the girl from the Lucky Carp Alliance.

00:32:14.840 --> 00:32:16.240
Don't make any mistakes.

00:32:17.000 --> 00:32:17.640
Yes.

00:32:18.200 --> 00:32:21.120
The charity show tomorrow is ready.

00:32:21.520 --> 00:32:24.580
Gu Jin'er will be there on time to distribute porridge.

00:32:24.600 --> 00:32:27.330
Hold the heart of the people that should be taken.

00:32:27.680 --> 00:32:28.440
Go back.

00:32:28.920 --> 00:32:29.980
Thank you, my lord.

00:32:40.120 --> 00:32:43.160
Hero, how is it?

00:32:43.520 --> 00:32:46.200
It'll start in an hour.

00:32:46.680 --> 00:32:48.440
Hurry up.

00:32:48.720 --> 00:32:50.600
I can't control my hand.

00:32:51.360 --> 00:32:53.040
If only there was a wooden shelf

00:32:53.040 --> 00:32:54.440
can be fixed.

00:32:54.480 --> 00:32:56.200
Hero, don't worry.

00:32:56.280 --> 00:32:57.240
Let's try again.

00:32:57.920 --> 00:32:58.840
Get ready.

00:32:58.960 --> 00:33:00.680
The physicians are also preparing.

00:33:00.680 --> 00:33:01.400
Hurry up.

00:33:09.720 --> 00:33:11.120
I'm afraid it won't work.

00:33:12.160 --> 00:33:13.520
The fear of a hero

00:33:13.640 --> 00:33:15.400
for some time.

00:33:15.880 --> 00:33:16.680
Today,

00:33:17.400 --> 00:33:19.000
can't help me put on makeup.

00:33:20.680 --> 00:33:21.880
Let's try again.

00:33:25.200 --> 00:33:26.640
Let the performers

00:33:26.880 --> 00:33:28.920
Now go to the porridge shop

00:33:29.240 --> 00:33:31.000
Wear the most beautiful clothes

00:33:31.000 --> 00:33:32.680
and dance the most familiar dance.

00:33:32.680 --> 00:33:35.160
This dance doesn't need to be so lively.

00:33:35.360 --> 00:33:37.960
But we must be warm and sincere.

00:33:38.200 --> 00:33:40.920
and ask them to bring more copper coins to spend money.

00:33:40.920 --> 00:33:43.480
But to stabilize the people in your name,

00:33:43.920 --> 00:33:44.880
We call it

00:33:48.520 --> 00:33:49.680
to the public.

00:33:49.760 --> 00:33:51.290
Jin'er is not feeling well.

00:33:51.400 --> 00:33:52.680
but I care about the people.

00:33:52.680 --> 00:33:56.720
He's willing to give out all he has to give porridge and food.

00:33:58.280 --> 00:33:59.720
Everything

00:34:00.680 --> 00:34:01.440
Mom.

00:34:02.040 --> 00:34:03.920
What? You don't want to leave?

00:34:04.680 --> 00:34:05.720
Are you stupid?

00:34:06.360 --> 00:34:08.199
If you were the Oiran again,

00:34:08.520 --> 00:34:09.679
the money

00:34:09.960 --> 00:34:11.400
can be saved.

00:34:11.760 --> 00:34:13.600
If you can't pass the first test,

00:34:13.600 --> 00:34:15.260
what will you do in the future?

00:34:16.440 --> 00:34:17.239
That's right.

00:34:18.600 --> 00:34:19.760
Huan, hurry up.

00:34:19.880 --> 00:34:20.840
Come with me to get the money.

00:34:20.840 --> 00:34:21.520
Hurry up.

00:34:22.600 --> 00:34:23.440
How is he?

00:34:26.440 --> 00:34:29.120
Hero, we still have some time.

00:34:29.320 --> 00:34:30.280
Try again.

00:34:30.520 --> 00:34:31.840
Come on, okay?

00:34:36.880 --> 00:34:37.400
Sir.

00:34:37.520 --> 00:34:38.400
Have a rest.

00:34:38.920 --> 00:34:39.980
Young Master Ying.

00:34:41.159 --> 00:34:41.639
My lord.

00:34:41.880 --> 00:34:42.400
Say it.

00:34:43.400 --> 00:34:44.400
Someone reported

00:34:44.920 --> 00:34:46.980
Miss Xiao is organizing a gathering.

00:34:47.280 --> 00:34:48.239
The location is

00:34:48.440 --> 00:34:49.840
Turn to the north.

00:34:50.400 --> 00:34:52.040
You can get off the sedan and take a look.

00:34:52.040 --> 00:34:53.560
Turn north ahead

00:34:54.239 --> 00:34:55.600
Isn't it a fireworks lane?

00:34:55.600 --> 00:34:56.280
Yes.

00:34:56.719 --> 00:34:57.720
It's very lively.

00:34:57.880 --> 00:34:59.740
The most popular fireworks lane.

00:35:02.440 --> 00:35:03.440
Hello, everyone.

00:35:04.440 --> 00:35:05.920
I'm Hua Xiaochi.

00:35:06.480 --> 00:35:07.560
A few days ago,

00:35:07.560 --> 00:35:10.120
a few days ago.

00:35:12.520 --> 00:35:13.560
Go down.

00:35:14.520 --> 00:35:14.960
Come down.

00:35:14.960 --> 00:35:15.960
Today,

00:35:16.520 --> 00:35:17.800
I want to sincerely

00:35:18.040 --> 00:35:20.960
to all the people in Chang'an.

00:35:22.000 --> 00:35:22.840
I'm sorry.

00:35:23.440 --> 00:35:24.500
Does apology work?

00:35:25.560 --> 00:35:26.400
Go down.

00:35:27.320 --> 00:35:28.000
Go down.

00:35:28.840 --> 00:35:29.520
Shame on you.

00:35:29.520 --> 00:35:30.080
Get down.

00:35:30.960 --> 00:35:32.440
In the place I live,

00:35:33.120 --> 00:35:34.960
In order to achieve my goal,

00:35:35.240 --> 00:35:37.720
he would do something

00:35:38.120 --> 00:35:39.640
and even hurt others.

00:35:40.040 --> 00:35:41.500
Before I came to Chang'an,

00:35:41.640 --> 00:35:43.100
before I came to Chang'an.

00:35:44.440 --> 00:35:45.960
I think a person should

00:35:46.480 --> 00:35:47.640
live for himself.

00:35:48.120 --> 00:35:51.050
you should never give up until you achieve your goal.

00:35:51.840 --> 00:35:52.720
In our place,

00:35:53.080 --> 00:35:54.440
This is called a competition.

00:35:54.440 --> 00:35:55.440
What?

00:35:58.840 --> 00:35:59.880
Your trick

00:36:00.960 --> 00:36:02.360
to win people's support.

00:36:02.560 --> 00:36:03.320
Does it work?

00:36:03.800 --> 00:36:04.520
You saw it.

00:36:05.040 --> 00:36:07.240
These people are yelling to beat her up.

00:36:07.400 --> 00:36:08.060
Screaming.

00:36:09.520 --> 00:36:11.240
I'll be beaten to death

00:36:11.600 --> 00:36:12.600
What should we do?

00:36:14.320 --> 00:36:14.960
That's why

00:36:15.360 --> 00:36:17.880
Xiao Zheng asked us to wait here.

00:36:18.320 --> 00:36:19.800
If someone hits her later,

00:36:20.000 --> 00:36:21.600
you can go ahead

00:36:22.440 --> 00:36:23.640
to everyone.

00:36:23.640 --> 00:36:25.800
Pretend to beat her up

00:36:25.960 --> 00:36:28.620
and tell her to get rid of the evil for the people.

00:36:29.440 --> 00:36:30.970
Your wife is quite cunning.

00:36:31.880 --> 00:36:33.480
Acting without real things.

00:36:34.240 --> 00:36:37.280
You know how to do this?

00:36:38.880 --> 00:36:39.440
Got it.

00:36:41.240 --> 00:36:41.920
What?

00:36:42.400 --> 00:36:43.600
Apologize in public.

00:36:43.720 --> 00:36:44.850
That's right, boss.

00:36:45.240 --> 00:36:47.040
Apologize on the street in the fireworks alley.

00:36:47.040 --> 00:36:48.240
and repeat

00:36:48.240 --> 00:36:49.440
what I did wrong.

00:36:49.640 --> 00:36:51.280
Your attitude of admitting your mistake is quite sincere.

00:36:51.280 --> 00:36:52.740
Some people say it's okay.

00:36:52.760 --> 00:36:54.440
Some want to beat her up.

00:36:55.640 --> 00:36:56.440
Hit her.

00:36:57.120 --> 00:36:57.600
Let's go! Let's go!

00:36:57.600 --> 00:36:58.640
Don't worry.

00:36:58.920 --> 00:36:59.640
Don't worry.

00:36:59.640 --> 00:37:00.760
She's a girl.

00:37:00.920 --> 00:37:02.480
No one can do it.

00:37:03.120 --> 00:37:04.480
After I came to Chang'an,

00:37:04.480 --> 00:37:05.480
I started to think

00:37:05.960 --> 00:37:07.360
The vicious competition

00:37:07.840 --> 00:37:09.960
and make people use of each other.

00:37:10.320 --> 00:37:13.160
making people lose trust.

00:37:13.280 --> 00:37:14.540
Without true friends,

00:37:15.320 --> 00:37:16.960
we become more hostile.

00:37:17.560 --> 00:37:20.800
Everyday, we fight endlessly

00:37:21.040 --> 00:37:23.700
What I do is getting more and more unreasonable.

00:37:24.360 --> 00:37:25.960
You don't even care about others' feelings.

00:37:25.960 --> 00:37:26.760
Go down.

00:37:27.000 --> 00:37:27.920
Go down.

00:37:27.960 --> 00:37:28.560
Get down.

00:37:29.720 --> 00:37:30.560
I really

00:37:31.440 --> 00:37:32.480
deserve

00:37:33.120 --> 00:37:34.580
to be respected by anyone.

00:37:35.160 --> 00:37:35.960
What?

00:37:38.600 --> 00:37:40.920
I used to yearn for fame and fortune.

00:37:41.760 --> 00:37:43.600
But now I'm really scared.

00:37:44.080 --> 00:37:45.440
In the future,

00:37:45.840 --> 00:37:47.120
If only fame and profit

00:37:47.640 --> 00:37:48.840
how cold would it be?

00:37:50.240 --> 00:37:52.240
That's why I stopped making excuses

00:37:52.240 --> 00:37:54.640
saying that there's no way out in Chang'an.

00:37:54.720 --> 00:37:57.040
I had no choice but to do bad things.

00:37:58.560 --> 00:38:01.120
How can there be so many things that can't be forced?

00:38:01.120 --> 00:38:03.080
I'm just too selfish.

00:38:03.960 --> 00:38:04.960
That makes sense.

00:38:05.040 --> 00:38:06.480
What she said is quite pitiful.

00:38:06.480 --> 00:38:07.920
She's reflecting on herself.

00:38:07.920 --> 00:38:08.480
Go down.

00:38:08.800 --> 00:38:09.400
Go down.

00:38:09.560 --> 00:38:10.400
Maybe

00:38:11.440 --> 00:38:12.920
I can't be a good person.

00:38:14.320 --> 00:38:16.440
But I will try not to be a bad person.

00:38:17.080 --> 00:38:19.080
I'll try my best

00:38:19.640 --> 00:38:21.320
I'm really

00:38:21.960 --> 00:38:23.000
really sorry.

00:38:24.800 --> 00:38:25.560
I'm sorry.

00:38:27.040 --> 00:38:28.520
Get down.

00:38:34.160 --> 00:38:34.960
No way.

00:38:35.440 --> 00:38:36.700
Do I deserve a beating?

00:38:37.040 --> 00:38:37.640
Get down.

00:38:38.120 --> 00:38:38.760
Go down.

00:38:39.160 --> 00:38:39.760
Get down.

00:38:41.400 --> 00:38:42.000
Come down.

00:38:44.040 --> 00:38:44.480
Go!

00:38:46.840 --> 00:38:49.480
Get down. Get down.

00:38:50.080 --> 00:38:50.720
Hit her.

00:38:50.960 --> 00:38:51.400
Yes.

00:38:51.400 --> 00:38:52.600
Hit her.

00:38:52.600 --> 00:38:54.000
Hit her! Hit her! Hit her!

00:38:54.320 --> 00:38:55.120
Hit her!

00:38:59.160 --> 00:38:59.800
Hit her.

00:39:00.000 --> 00:39:00.520
Hit her!

00:39:00.520 --> 00:39:01.600
You'll die a horrible death.

00:39:01.600 --> 00:39:03.040
Beat her! Beat her!

00:39:03.840 --> 00:39:04.400
Hit her.

00:39:04.520 --> 00:39:05.160
Hit her!

00:39:06.360 --> 00:39:07.040
Beat her up!

00:39:07.040 --> 00:39:07.520
Zheng!

00:39:07.840 --> 00:39:08.360
Beat her up!

00:39:08.360 --> 00:39:09.480
I'm the king of hell.

00:39:09.480 --> 00:39:10.610
Who dares to do this?

00:39:10.840 --> 00:39:11.440
Beat her!

00:39:11.760 --> 00:39:12.160
I...

00:39:12.520 --> 00:39:12.960
Beat her.

00:39:12.960 --> 00:39:13.840
Xu Ziqi!

00:39:13.960 --> 00:39:14.440
Beat her!

00:39:14.440 --> 00:39:15.160
Separate hatred.

00:39:15.160 --> 00:39:16.280
Hit her!

00:39:16.280 --> 00:39:17.800
Xu Ziqi!

00:39:18.280 --> 00:39:19.440
Why are you here?

00:39:19.520 --> 00:39:20.600
Why are you so violent?

00:39:20.600 --> 00:39:21.880
Sit down and talk.

00:39:21.960 --> 00:39:22.800
Let's go!

00:39:23.320 --> 00:39:24.250
Hit her! Hit her!

00:39:27.080 --> 00:39:27.440
Boss Xu.

00:39:27.440 --> 00:39:28.600
Zheng!

00:39:28.600 --> 00:39:29.080
Hit her!

00:39:29.320 --> 00:39:31.160
Aren't you going to hit Xiao Zheng?

00:39:31.160 --> 00:39:32.320
Why did you hit me?

00:39:32.320 --> 00:39:32.850
Chief Xu.

00:39:35.520 --> 00:39:36.360
Stop!

00:39:36.360 --> 00:39:36.720
Beat her!

00:39:36.720 --> 00:39:37.280
Ziqi

00:39:37.760 --> 00:39:38.440
Ziqi!

00:39:38.440 --> 00:39:38.970
Beat her!

00:39:39.240 --> 00:39:39.960
Ziqi

00:39:40.960 --> 00:39:41.600
Ziqi.

00:39:42.880 --> 00:39:44.920
Brother Xu, you misunderstood.

00:39:46.920 --> 00:39:48.080
My brothers

00:39:48.440 --> 00:39:50.400
to protect Zheng.

00:39:50.480 --> 00:39:51.440
But I didn't expect

00:39:51.440 --> 00:39:53.440
You're making Brother Xu all wet.

00:39:53.960 --> 00:39:54.760
Khagan.

00:39:55.760 --> 00:39:56.820
It doesn't matter.

00:39:57.160 --> 00:39:58.220
But Hua Xiao Zheng,

00:39:58.320 --> 00:39:59.440
What are you doing?

00:40:01.160 --> 00:40:02.520
I apologize.

00:40:03.080 --> 00:40:05.280
Didn't you hear what the separation said?

00:40:05.280 --> 00:40:07.410
Famous prostitute needs popularity.

00:40:07.880 --> 00:40:10.680
I'm being boycotted by all the people in Chang'an.

00:40:10.800 --> 00:40:12.160
How can I be popular?

00:40:13.080 --> 00:40:14.360
So I thought

00:40:14.720 --> 00:40:17.880
I should apologize to you sincerely.

00:40:18.320 --> 00:40:20.520
Maybe we can get rid of some resentment.

00:40:21.160 --> 00:40:22.080
Who knows?

00:40:22.960 --> 00:40:23.880
As you can see,

00:40:24.400 --> 00:40:25.880
how can the resentment

00:40:26.720 --> 00:40:28.520
can't be erased so easily.

00:40:31.720 --> 00:40:33.040
Boss!

00:40:33.960 --> 00:40:34.360
Brother!

00:40:34.360 --> 00:40:34.960
What's wrong?

00:40:34.960 --> 00:40:35.840
Good news.

00:40:36.240 --> 00:40:38.520
She's already in the top ten.

00:40:39.440 --> 00:40:40.000
Really?

00:40:40.360 --> 00:40:40.960
Really

00:40:41.240 --> 00:40:44.560
Everyone is praising her for being brave and responsible.

00:40:44.760 --> 00:40:45.240
Yes.

00:40:46.120 --> 00:40:46.600
Yes.

00:40:46.920 --> 00:40:48.360
Anyway, the voting is very active.

00:40:48.360 --> 00:40:49.880
That scene was popular.

00:40:49.960 --> 00:40:51.720
It was so loud and crowded.

00:40:52.280 --> 00:40:52.720
Good.

00:40:55.880 --> 00:40:57.040
If you are sincere, it will work.

00:40:57.040 --> 00:40:58.840
Voting is a big game.

00:40:59.120 --> 00:40:59.600
OK.

00:41:02.440 --> 00:41:03.280
Xu Ziqi.

00:41:03.920 --> 00:41:06.160
Why are you still looking at me like that?

00:41:06.160 --> 00:41:07.440
I did it.

00:41:07.960 --> 00:41:09.360
Who's looking at you?

00:41:09.760 --> 00:41:12.360
I hurt my neck just now.

00:41:12.960 --> 00:41:14.560
It's not convenient to turn.

00:41:15.440 --> 00:41:16.570
Who wants to see you?

00:41:17.600 --> 00:41:19.260
Brother Xu sprained his neck.

00:41:23.120 --> 00:41:23.920
No need.

00:41:24.080 --> 00:41:24.920
No need.

00:41:27.080 --> 00:41:27.720
Boss.

00:41:29.720 --> 00:41:31.440
There's a new notice on the notice board.

00:41:31.440 --> 00:41:33.240
The first round of the Oiran competition

00:41:33.240 --> 00:41:34.040
is out.

00:41:36.080 --> 00:41:36.640
Okay.

00:41:37.320 --> 00:41:38.400
Let's start.

00:41:41.960 --> 00:41:42.560
This...

00:41:43.600 --> 00:41:45.480
Brother Xu, don't you need my help?

00:41:45.480 --> 00:41:47.280
My brother is living a good life.

00:41:48.920 --> 00:41:49.850
I'm leaving too.

00:41:54.000 --> 00:41:55.000
Come, take a seat.

00:41:55.040 --> 00:41:56.170
What else did he say?

00:41:57.120 --> 00:41:57.760
She said

00:41:58.000 --> 00:41:59.660
your wife can change her past.

00:41:59.760 --> 00:42:01.160
Everyone thinks it's great.

00:42:01.160 --> 00:42:02.290
They all support us.

00:42:02.920 --> 00:42:03.320
OK.

00:42:10.320 --> 00:42:13.040
Great. It's just a competition.

00:42:13.040 --> 00:42:13.080
Visual.

00:42:13.080 --> 00:42:13.440
Pick eyes.

00:42:13.440 --> 00:42:14.560
It's not hard.

00:42:29.800 --> 00:42:31.000
Believe in yourself.

00:42:31.120 --> 00:42:32.180
and chase bravely.

00:42:35.520 --> 00:42:36.960
There's another line.

00:42:44.000 --> 00:42:45.280
Double dance.

00:42:52.480 --> 00:42:55.280
Who is the best dancer in Chang'an?

00:42:55.960 --> 00:42:57.720
The man who said the best dancer in Chang'an

00:42:57.720 --> 00:42:58.480
is you.

00:42:59.000 --> 00:42:59.880
Say it.

00:43:00.480 --> 00:43:03.000
Say something, Xu Ziqi.
