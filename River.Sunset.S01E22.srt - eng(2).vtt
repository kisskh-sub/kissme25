00:01:38.359 --> 00:01:39.159
Sir

00:01:41.079 --> 00:01:42.200
Received a telegram.

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:43.599
It's a plaintext telegram.

00:01:51.879 --> 00:01:53.480
Send a telegram immediately.

00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:55.480
To Commander Yuan of the 3rd Column.

00:01:55.480 --> 00:01:57.319
Tell them I will go today.

00:01:57.599 --> 00:01:59.120
Have him go to Huangyang Mountain's

00:01:59.120 --> 00:02:01.239
Provisional Seventh Detachment to meet me.

00:02:01.239 --> 00:02:01.879
Yes, sir. (Support Admin Watch on
kissasia.cam or kisskh.org)

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:14.919
Come, come, come.

00:02:14.919 --> 00:02:15.560
Move a bit this way.

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:16.400
Move a bit this way.

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:19.719
This...

00:02:20.479 --> 00:02:21.479
Folks.

00:02:21.879 --> 00:02:23.240
Let me read to you first.

00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:24.680
This notice here.

00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:28.599
To celebrate the Emperor's birthday,

00:02:28.599 --> 00:02:30.039
the Police Battalion

00:02:30.039 --> 00:02:33.199
will soon lift the sea ban,

00:02:33.599 --> 00:02:37.639
allowing young men to go out fishing,

00:02:37.639 --> 00:02:42.120
and agreeing that in early April,

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:46.080
a date will be chosen to go fishing.

00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:47.520
The sea ban has been on for four years.

00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:49.280
Is it real that they're suddenly lifting it?

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:49.879
Is it real?

00:02:49.879 --> 00:02:51.400
Of course it's real.

00:02:51.719 --> 00:02:53.360
This is a good thing.

00:02:53.479 --> 00:02:54.400
Really.

00:02:57.840 --> 00:02:58.560
Listen.

00:02:58.560 --> 00:02:59.199
Quiet.

00:02:59.199 --> 00:03:00.479
Everyone be quiet.

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:02.680
So everyone...

00:03:02.960 --> 00:03:03.800
now...

00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:05.080
put down the...

00:03:05.080 --> 00:03:07.000
farm work in your hands.

00:03:07.719 --> 00:03:08.599
Go home and...

00:03:08.879 --> 00:03:09.759
repair the boats,

00:03:10.159 --> 00:03:11.159
weave the nets,

00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:13.240
prepare for going out to sea.

00:03:13.240 --> 00:03:14.120
Okay?

00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:15.479
Okay!

00:03:15.479 --> 00:03:16.560
Go back and prepare well.

00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:17.319
Okay!

00:03:17.719 --> 00:03:20.159
Then hurry up and prepare.

00:03:20.159 --> 00:03:21.560
Heaven has opened its eyes!

00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:22.639
Repair the boats.

00:03:22.719 --> 00:03:23.879
Let's go.

00:03:25.080 --> 00:03:26.400
Attention, fellow villagers.

00:03:26.800 --> 00:03:27.479
Repair your fishing boats.

00:03:27.479 --> 00:03:28.400
Repair your fishing nets.

00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:30.159
Wait for the notice to set sail.

00:03:33.240 --> 00:03:34.919
Is Master Ye home?

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:39.400
Who is it?

00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:40.879
Si Po.

00:03:40.879 --> 00:03:41.520
Looking for our Master.

00:03:41.520 --> 00:03:42.759
What is it about?

00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:44.680
The sea ban is being lifted.

00:03:44.960 --> 00:03:46.840
I'm here to tell Master De.

00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:50.960
Then what are they here for?

00:03:52.719 --> 00:03:54.479
Mr. Fukuda is going door to door

00:03:54.479 --> 00:03:56.680
to register the list of people going to sea.

00:03:56.960 --> 00:03:58.319
In the future, what we catch at sea,

00:03:58.319 --> 00:03:59.400
those fish,

00:03:59.719 --> 00:04:02.000
Mr. Fukuda will buy them all.

00:04:03.759 --> 00:04:04.800
Then wait a moment.

00:04:04.800 --> 00:04:06.080
I'll go tell the Master.

00:04:08.599 --> 00:04:09.280
Go.

00:04:13.639 --> 00:04:14.879
Not here.

00:04:14.879 --> 00:04:15.960
Move aside.

00:04:30.279 --> 00:04:32.199
Mr. Fukuda,

00:04:32.800 --> 00:04:34.959
regarding Master Ye's situation,

00:04:35.319 --> 00:04:36.160
I know it all.

00:04:36.639 --> 00:04:37.680
Their family only has

00:04:37.680 --> 00:04:39.480
Longxia as the only young man.

00:04:39.480 --> 00:04:41.480
Just write him down.

00:04:41.480 --> 00:04:42.560
Hurry up.

00:04:42.560 --> 00:04:44.240
Go to the next house and register quickly.

00:04:44.240 --> 00:04:44.839
Alright.

00:04:44.920 --> 00:04:45.560
Old Li,

00:04:45.560 --> 00:04:46.480
take him there quickly.

00:04:46.480 --> 00:04:47.399
Right, right, right.

00:04:52.079 --> 00:04:52.720
Let's go.

00:04:53.720 --> 00:04:54.959
I will... with Master Ye...

00:04:54.959 --> 00:04:56.000
explain a bit more.

00:04:56.360 --> 00:04:57.160
You go first.

00:04:59.279 --> 00:05:00.199
Let's go.

00:05:07.040 --> 00:05:07.759
Bingchen.

00:05:10.199 --> 00:05:11.199
Master De.

00:05:11.199 --> 00:05:12.600
What's with all the gongs and drums?

00:05:12.879 --> 00:05:14.920
The Japanese are lifting the sea ban.

00:05:16.079 --> 00:05:16.920
Master De.

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:19.639
The Japanese on the island

00:05:19.639 --> 00:05:21.000
are secretly investigating

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:22.519
who is raising pigeons.

00:05:23.079 --> 00:05:24.920
Where would my family get pigeons?

00:05:32.639 --> 00:05:34.319
The Japanese are very cunning.

00:05:34.600 --> 00:05:36.399
Better to be careful.

00:05:43.720 --> 00:05:45.920
This is that

00:05:46.480 --> 00:05:48.040
notice lifting the sea ban.

00:06:00.800 --> 00:06:01.879
All right

00:06:06.040 --> 00:06:07.560
All right, you go ahead then

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:09.199
I'll take my leave

00:06:26.839 --> 00:06:30.040
What are you feeding with this corn?

00:06:31.199 --> 00:06:32.319
We eat it ourselves

00:06:32.560 --> 00:06:33.800
We eat it ourselves

00:06:34.680 --> 00:06:36.399
Don't you keep pigeons at home?

00:06:36.399 --> 00:06:36.720
Look for yourself

00:06:36.720 --> 00:06:37.800
See if we keep pigeons

00:06:38.519 --> 00:06:39.519
No, no

00:06:39.519 --> 00:06:40.680
No one keeps pigeons

00:06:41.879 --> 00:06:46.800
Then who in this village keeps pigeons?

00:06:47.319 --> 00:06:48.720
Who knows?

00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:49.839
No one does

00:06:52.120 --> 00:06:52.879
Let's go

00:06:57.399 --> 00:06:58.040
Dad

00:06:58.399 --> 00:06:59.000
You were looking for me?

00:06:59.000 --> 00:06:59.480
Yes

00:07:03.519 --> 00:07:05.600
Tang Bingchen just came and said...

00:07:07.560 --> 00:07:08.959
...that the Japanese have agreed...

00:07:08.959 --> 00:07:10.160
...to let the villagers go to sea

00:07:10.160 --> 00:07:10.839
I was just looking for you...

00:07:10.839 --> 00:07:11.759
...to talk about this

00:07:11.759 --> 00:07:12.639
Just now at the village entrance...

00:07:12.639 --> 00:07:13.639
...I saw the notice

00:07:13.639 --> 00:07:14.879
The villagers are discussing it too

00:07:15.759 --> 00:07:16.879
What do you think?

00:07:17.319 --> 00:07:17.920
Dad

00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:19.959
Can we take this opportunity...

00:07:19.959 --> 00:07:21.360
...to move the Major out?

00:07:21.800 --> 00:07:23.480
And have Uncle over in Macau...

00:07:23.480 --> 00:07:24.480
...pick him up

00:07:25.160 --> 00:07:26.000
Should we send Uncle...

00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:27.000
...a message?

00:07:28.959 --> 00:07:30.759
Actually, Tang Bingchen told me today...

00:07:30.759 --> 00:07:31.800
...that the Japanese...

00:07:33.360 --> 00:07:34.800
...are investigating the pigeons

00:07:35.879 --> 00:07:36.480
No wonder

00:07:37.240 --> 00:07:38.519
Just now when I passed the village entrance...

00:07:38.519 --> 00:07:40.639
...I saw the Japanese asking questions

00:07:41.160 --> 00:07:43.120
Luckily they don't suspect us yet

00:07:43.120 --> 00:07:44.160
But from now on...

00:07:45.240 --> 00:07:47.000
...we must be careful

00:07:47.319 --> 00:07:48.079
Okay

00:07:48.519 --> 00:07:48.920
Dad

00:07:48.920 --> 00:07:50.079
Then what about the Major?

00:07:51.279 --> 00:07:52.959
We must plan before we act

00:07:53.680 --> 00:07:55.720
Before the situation becomes clear...

00:07:57.240 --> 00:07:58.879
...don't rush to tell your Uncle

00:07:59.199 --> 00:08:00.480
Let me think about it

00:08:01.120 --> 00:08:01.720
All right

00:08:01.720 --> 00:08:02.480
Okay

00:08:06.519 --> 00:08:07.759
Sir

00:08:08.240 --> 00:08:09.720
Pack up immediately

00:08:10.040 --> 00:08:11.480
We're returning to Zhongshan now

00:08:11.480 --> 00:08:12.360
Yes, sir

00:08:54.720 --> 00:08:55.360
Your Excellency

00:08:55.360 --> 00:08:55.919
Mm

00:08:55.919 --> 00:08:57.960
The men we sent out have returned to report

00:08:58.000 --> 00:08:58.879
that early this morning,

00:08:58.879 --> 00:09:00.039
the master of Anlan Tang summoned

00:09:00.039 --> 00:09:02.559
all the branch leaders for a meeting.

00:09:02.600 --> 00:09:04.159
They haven't come out yet.

00:09:06.480 --> 00:09:08.759
Anlan Tang is quite active, isn't it?

00:09:09.159 --> 00:09:11.919
Do we know what they are discussing?

00:09:12.480 --> 00:09:13.519
Since we haven't yet

00:09:13.519 --> 00:09:15.240
infiltrated their inner circle,

00:09:15.240 --> 00:09:16.559
it's not quite clear for now.

00:09:17.919 --> 00:09:18.639
A few days ago,

00:09:18.639 --> 00:09:19.759
that group that appeared at Anlan Tang,

00:09:19.759 --> 00:09:21.279
have you identified them?

00:09:22.279 --> 00:09:23.360
According to preliminary findings,

00:09:23.360 --> 00:09:25.200
in recent days, Anlan Tang has indeed

00:09:25.200 --> 00:09:26.919
seen the arrival of a group of mysterious figures.

00:09:27.240 --> 00:09:28.279
The leader brought along

00:09:28.279 --> 00:09:30.279
a dozen guards dressed in black.

00:09:30.279 --> 00:09:31.320
Very imposing.

00:09:32.279 --> 00:09:34.320
Who are they?

00:09:35.240 --> 00:09:37.480
We estimate they are from the mainland.

00:09:38.320 --> 00:09:40.320
They might be related to the Chiang government.

00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:43.480
You say "estimate"?

00:09:46.320 --> 00:09:48.639
Intelligence work absolutely does not allow

00:09:48.639 --> 00:09:49.879
the use of such terms.

00:09:49.879 --> 00:09:50.360
Yes, sir.

00:09:50.360 --> 00:09:51.360
I will go verify it immediately.

00:09:52.759 --> 00:09:55.320
Oshima Hiroshi of the 6th Air Base

00:09:55.320 --> 00:09:59.240
is a very strong-willed man.

00:10:00.519 --> 00:10:02.679
Unless things are extremely difficult,

00:10:02.679 --> 00:10:04.960
he would not ask for our help.

00:10:05.480 --> 00:10:07.399
Can't you find a way

00:10:07.399 --> 00:10:08.720
inside Anlan Tang?

00:10:09.799 --> 00:10:11.240
There is a candidate

00:10:11.240 --> 00:10:12.679
I was just about to report to you.

00:10:13.480 --> 00:10:15.080
You should have said so earlier.

00:10:19.720 --> 00:10:21.320
Who is he?

00:10:22.120 --> 00:10:23.519
This man is called Rat.

00:10:24.039 --> 00:10:25.639
He used to be in the Yashan area of the 8th District,

00:10:25.639 --> 00:10:26.960
the most famous hooligan.

00:10:27.480 --> 00:10:28.519
Not only is he dark-skinned,

00:10:28.519 --> 00:10:30.799
but his methods are ruthless and his heart even blacker.

00:10:31.320 --> 00:10:32.639
After we occupied the 8th District,

00:10:32.639 --> 00:10:33.720
he defected to

00:10:33.720 --> 00:10:35.200
Yuan Dai's 3rd Column,

00:10:35.200 --> 00:10:37.200
and developed excellent marksmanship.

00:10:37.559 --> 00:10:38.639
But later, he couldn't stand

00:10:38.639 --> 00:10:39.919
the constraints of the 3rd Column.

00:10:40.279 --> 00:10:42.799
He ran away to Macau.

00:10:42.799 --> 00:10:44.639
Ye Zhaogeng saved him.

00:10:44.639 --> 00:10:46.519
Now he is under Anlan Tang,

00:10:46.799 --> 00:10:47.919
Go on.

00:10:49.639 --> 00:10:51.960
Ye Zhaogeng valued his precise marksmanship

00:10:52.360 --> 00:10:53.600
and saw him as useful,

00:10:53.600 --> 00:10:54.480
so he gave him a position

00:10:54.480 --> 00:10:55.519
as a branch leader.

00:10:55.519 --> 00:10:56.240
Currently,

00:10:56.600 --> 00:10:57.519
he manages Anlan Tang's

00:10:57.519 --> 00:10:59.279
fishing boats and pier affairs.

00:11:00.879 --> 00:11:01.480
In that case,

00:11:01.480 --> 00:11:03.159
this man is somewhat dangerous.

00:11:04.080 --> 00:11:07.039
Is he loyal to Anlan Tang?

00:11:07.639 --> 00:11:11.159
Ye Zhaogeng cares for him greatly,

00:11:11.159 --> 00:11:12.200
and he only listens to

00:11:12.200 --> 00:11:13.960
Ye Zhaogeng's orders.

00:11:16.120 --> 00:11:17.080
Why do you think this man

00:11:17.080 --> 00:11:18.639
can be won over by us?

00:11:18.840 --> 00:11:20.960
Although loyal,

00:11:21.639 --> 00:11:22.879
he smokes opium,

00:11:22.879 --> 00:11:24.480
likes women,

00:11:24.480 --> 00:11:25.879
and gambles frequently.

00:11:25.879 --> 00:11:27.639
He currently owes the Yongli Casino

00:11:27.639 --> 00:11:29.480
a gambling debt of 200,000 yuan.

00:11:29.480 --> 00:11:31.559
He still has quite a few weaknesses.

00:11:32.039 --> 00:11:32.919
Mm.

00:11:33.559 --> 00:11:34.600
Good.

00:11:36.159 --> 00:11:38.000
Take the action squad to

00:11:38.360 --> 00:11:39.000
thoroughly monitor

00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:42.399
Anlan Tang and the Military Intelligence's Macau Station.

00:11:42.799 --> 00:11:43.720
Yes, sir.

00:11:44.519 --> 00:11:45.320
Also,

00:11:45.919 --> 00:11:48.120
go to Yongli Casino immediately,

00:11:48.120 --> 00:11:49.799
transfer all of Rat's gambling debts

00:11:49.799 --> 00:11:52.240
to our name,

00:11:53.200 --> 00:11:56.159
and secure this man.

00:11:56.960 --> 00:11:57.679
Yes, sir.

00:12:54.720 --> 00:12:56.039
Who is in charge of this ward?

00:12:56.519 --> 00:12:57.480
Dr. Ozu.

00:12:58.320 --> 00:12:59.080
I see.

00:12:59.759 --> 00:13:00.639
Keep watch outside.

00:13:00.639 --> 00:13:02.000
I need a word with him.

00:13:08.039 --> 00:13:08.840
Witt.

00:13:10.879 --> 00:13:11.720
Witt.

00:13:21.480 --> 00:13:22.399
Don't move.

00:13:28.159 --> 00:13:29.480
Feeling any better?

00:13:30.519 --> 00:13:31.720
Much better.

00:13:34.679 --> 00:13:36.000
I received news.

00:13:36.519 --> 00:13:37.279
The second Believer...

00:13:37.279 --> 00:13:38.320
...died in the crash.

00:13:43.759 --> 00:13:45.360
Tomorrow we'll have a chance...

00:13:45.679 --> 00:13:47.120
...to leave Sanzao Island.

00:13:48.080 --> 00:13:49.759
I planned to take you with me.

00:13:50.879 --> 00:13:52.480
But in your current condition...

00:13:53.320 --> 00:13:54.279
...rash action would only...

00:13:54.279 --> 00:13:55.639
...put you in greater danger.

00:13:57.759 --> 00:13:58.159
So I think...

00:13:58.159 --> 00:13:59.480
...I should send the intel out first.

00:13:59.720 --> 00:14:01.159
When you're better...

00:14:01.159 --> 00:14:01.679
...I'll find a way...

00:14:01.679 --> 00:14:02.960
...to get you off the island.

00:14:07.279 --> 00:14:08.399
How will you send it?

00:14:10.559 --> 00:14:11.240
I'll use the investigation...

00:14:11.240 --> 00:14:13.240
...of the Osumi Mineo crash site...

00:14:13.240 --> 00:14:14.559
...to go to Huangyang Mountain.

00:14:17.200 --> 00:14:17.960
Our people will be...

00:14:17.960 --> 00:14:18.919
...lying in wait there.

00:14:19.279 --> 00:14:21.000
There will be a firefight.

00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:21.840
In the chaos...

00:14:21.840 --> 00:14:23.840
...I'll hand the intel to our people.

00:14:35.360 --> 00:14:40.360
The content is on pages 24 to 34.

00:14:51.480 --> 00:14:54.679
Get it out safely.

00:14:56.080 --> 00:14:58.159
Send it to Quzhou Airport.

00:15:00.039 --> 00:15:02.000
But you must promise me one thing.

00:15:03.480 --> 00:15:05.279
If something goes wrong...

00:15:06.879 --> 00:15:09.639
...you must detonate it immediately.

00:15:10.799 --> 00:15:12.039
I promise.

00:15:18.480 --> 00:15:19.480
Aren't you worried I'll take it...

00:15:19.480 --> 00:15:20.480
...and never come back?

00:15:24.080 --> 00:15:25.039
See you later.

00:15:56.240 --> 00:15:57.240
Who is in charge?

00:15:57.519 --> 00:15:58.080
Sir.

00:15:58.080 --> 00:15:58.879
It is I.

00:15:59.919 --> 00:16:01.240
I need a doctor...

00:16:01.240 --> 00:16:02.000
...to come with me tomorrow...

00:16:02.000 --> 00:16:03.159
...on a mission.

00:16:03.159 --> 00:16:03.879
We have already received...

00:16:03.879 --> 00:16:04.919
...orders from HQ.

00:16:04.919 --> 00:16:06.080
We are arranging a doctor.

00:16:06.559 --> 00:16:08.080
Which one is Dr. Ozu?

00:16:08.519 --> 00:16:09.480
I am.

00:16:11.320 --> 00:16:12.360
We've met.

00:16:12.360 --> 00:16:12.919
Yes.

00:16:12.919 --> 00:16:13.600
Very well.

00:16:13.799 --> 00:16:14.919
Assign him.

00:16:15.120 --> 00:16:16.080
Yes, sir.

00:16:16.080 --> 00:16:17.519
Dr. Ozu will go.

00:16:17.519 --> 00:16:18.320
Tomorrow morning...

00:16:18.320 --> 00:16:19.799
...report to the Airport Garrison.

00:16:19.840 --> 00:16:20.720
Yes, sir.

00:16:26.480 --> 00:16:28.279
Not bad, Dr. Ozu.

00:16:28.279 --> 00:16:29.919
Catching the Colonel's eye.

00:16:29.919 --> 00:16:32.320
But if you leave, your patients...

00:16:32.320 --> 00:16:32.879
...especially that Private...

00:16:32.879 --> 00:16:34.879
...named Jiexin, what about him?

00:16:35.639 --> 00:16:36.879
I'll only be away for a few days.

00:16:36.879 --> 00:16:37.679
I'll ask Nurse Tang...

00:16:37.679 --> 00:16:38.799
...to look after him.

00:16:38.799 --> 00:16:39.639
All right.

00:16:40.080 --> 00:16:40.759
Get back to work.

00:16:40.759 --> 00:16:41.240
Yes.

00:17:02.720 --> 00:17:03.639
Let's talk inside.

00:17:26.319 --> 00:17:27.480
Use your memory.

00:17:27.519 --> 00:17:29.480
Take pages twenty-four to thirty-four,

00:17:29.480 --> 00:17:31.359
and memorize all their content.

00:17:31.359 --> 00:17:32.599
It must be accurate.

00:17:32.599 --> 00:17:33.960
Down to every single line.

00:17:33.960 --> 00:17:35.079
Every single word.

00:17:38.000 --> 00:17:39.559
Then what is this for?

00:17:39.559 --> 00:17:41.119
I've looked at it.

00:17:41.119 --> 00:17:43.400
The first nine pages seem to hide a

00:17:43.400 --> 00:17:45.279
wireless beacon for the plane's landing.

00:17:46.240 --> 00:17:48.519
The last page hides the plane's

00:17:48.519 --> 00:17:50.319
codes and call signs.

00:17:50.319 --> 00:17:52.720
Remember, for tomorrow's operation,

00:17:52.720 --> 00:17:54.200
in case something goes wrong,

00:17:54.400 --> 00:17:55.279
all the intelligence

00:17:55.279 --> 00:17:57.279
must be carried out in your head.

00:17:58.599 --> 00:17:59.799
You just said,

00:18:00.119 --> 00:18:01.160
"in case something goes wrong,"

00:18:01.160 --> 00:18:02.160
what does that mean?

00:18:03.640 --> 00:18:04.960
I said "in case."

00:18:06.880 --> 00:18:08.240
I don't want that to happen.

00:18:09.160 --> 00:18:10.640
I hope you'll be safe and sound.

00:18:12.519 --> 00:18:14.039
I hope I'll be okay too.

00:18:15.920 --> 00:18:16.759
I promise you,

00:18:17.240 --> 00:18:18.799
I'll do my best to protect myself,

00:18:19.240 --> 00:18:20.119
complete the mission,

00:18:20.119 --> 00:18:21.519
and come back to you as soon as possible.

00:18:24.160 --> 00:18:25.640
But I have to say it again.

00:18:26.480 --> 00:18:26.960
If tomorrow,

00:18:26.960 --> 00:18:28.359
something goes wrong on my end,

00:18:28.880 --> 00:18:29.559
remember,

00:18:29.920 --> 00:18:31.240
do whatever it takes

00:18:31.480 --> 00:18:32.200
to get the intelligence

00:18:32.200 --> 00:18:34.119
into the hands of someone you trust.

00:18:34.119 --> 00:18:35.400
Complete our mission.

00:18:36.039 --> 00:18:37.039
Can you do that?

00:18:39.759 --> 00:18:41.160
You must do it.

00:18:43.880 --> 00:18:45.839
You have the afternoon and evening.

00:18:46.160 --> 00:18:47.599
I'm going to the Anti-Aircraft Squadron now

00:18:47.599 --> 00:18:48.880
to arrange things for tomorrow.

00:18:49.240 --> 00:18:51.680
I'll come get the Bible before the operation.

00:20:11.920 --> 00:20:12.839
Darn it

00:20:13.359 --> 00:20:14.799
This Wumu Ichiro

00:20:14.799 --> 00:20:15.960
is really pushing his luck

00:20:16.200 --> 00:20:17.079
Captain

00:20:17.480 --> 00:20:19.279
If I had been there

00:20:19.279 --> 00:20:20.279
I would have jammed my gun

00:20:20.279 --> 00:20:22.160
into that woman and Kewen's mouths

00:20:22.160 --> 00:20:24.480
and seen if he still argued

00:20:24.480 --> 00:20:25.279
Captain

00:20:28.200 --> 00:20:29.599
The opponent is stronger than we imagined

00:20:29.759 --> 00:20:30.559
And his public identity

00:20:30.559 --> 00:20:31.759
seems to be our current

00:20:31.799 --> 00:20:33.079
biggest obstacle

00:20:33.079 --> 00:20:34.160
Report

00:20:36.640 --> 00:20:37.279
Report

00:20:37.279 --> 00:20:39.079
Telegram from Macau, China

00:20:39.359 --> 00:20:40.240
Dismissed

00:20:46.559 --> 00:20:47.119
From the Macau, China Tokko

00:20:47.119 --> 00:20:48.480
Colonel Eizawa sent a wire

00:20:50.240 --> 00:20:50.799
A group has appeared in Macau, China

00:20:50.799 --> 00:20:52.119
of rather mysterious figures

00:20:53.359 --> 00:20:54.480
This group went to Anlan Tang

00:20:54.480 --> 00:20:55.640
They were very imposing

00:20:56.359 --> 00:20:59.480
The leader had over a dozen guards

00:21:00.599 --> 00:21:01.400
Does this group have any connection

00:21:01.400 --> 00:21:02.559
to our base?

00:21:02.839 --> 00:21:04.079
This group seems to be Juntong personnel

00:21:04.480 --> 00:21:05.759
But today, this group suddenly disappeared

00:21:05.759 --> 00:21:07.799
It seems they returned to Zhongshan territory

00:21:11.880 --> 00:21:12.880
Captain

00:21:13.599 --> 00:21:15.160
I think this group

00:21:15.160 --> 00:21:16.759
is definitely linked to the two people

00:21:16.759 --> 00:21:17.839
who smuggled onto the island from Anlan Tang

00:21:17.839 --> 00:21:20.480
Why did they return to Zhongshan?

00:21:22.680 --> 00:21:23.400
Sasaki

00:21:23.720 --> 00:21:24.119
Yes

00:21:24.119 --> 00:21:25.160
Go check with the Base Operations Section

00:21:25.160 --> 00:21:25.960
if in the past two days within Zhongshan

00:21:25.960 --> 00:21:27.079
we have had any operations

00:21:27.079 --> 00:21:27.960
Yes

00:21:34.160 --> 00:21:35.200
Tomorrow morning

00:21:35.200 --> 00:21:37.079
we will take a boat from the Patrol Boat Detachment

00:21:37.319 --> 00:21:40.000
via the Niwan secret passage

00:21:40.079 --> 00:21:41.319
Finally

00:21:41.319 --> 00:21:43.319
we will arrive near Dachikan

00:21:43.920 --> 00:21:44.920
and land there

00:21:45.160 --> 00:21:46.200
Then proceed on foot to

00:21:46.200 --> 00:21:48.400
the crash site on Huangyang Mountain

00:21:48.880 --> 00:21:49.759
Commander Fujita

00:21:49.759 --> 00:21:51.480
specifically for this operation

00:21:51.480 --> 00:21:52.640
has equipped us with a radio

00:21:52.640 --> 00:21:53.920
a radio operator

00:21:53.920 --> 00:21:55.920
and a team doctor

00:21:55.920 --> 00:21:56.480
I hope everyone

00:21:56.480 --> 00:21:57.680
will be fully prepared

00:21:57.680 --> 00:21:58.319
One more thing

00:21:58.319 --> 00:22:00.079
I must emphasize to you that

00:22:00.079 --> 00:22:01.559
before the operation

00:22:01.559 --> 00:22:03.200
any news regarding this operation

00:22:03.200 --> 00:22:04.480
must not be revealed to

00:22:04.480 --> 00:22:05.680
any of the participants

00:22:05.680 --> 00:22:07.559
The time to convey orders is

00:22:07.559 --> 00:22:09.039
after boarding tomorrow morning

00:22:09.359 --> 00:22:10.400
Is that clear?

00:22:11.759 --> 00:22:12.720
Yes

00:22:12.880 --> 00:22:13.880
Dismissed

00:22:22.960 --> 00:22:23.599
Colonel

00:22:25.599 --> 00:22:29.240
Thank you very much, Sir,

00:22:29.279 --> 00:22:33.000
for your trust in us.

00:22:33.480 --> 00:22:34.160
Oh.

00:22:36.279 --> 00:22:38.279
My squadron

00:22:38.279 --> 00:22:40.880
since transferring from Taiwan, China to the 6th Air Base,

00:22:41.200 --> 00:22:41.839
the men haven't taken a single step

00:22:41.839 --> 00:22:43.119
off this small island.

00:22:43.759 --> 00:22:46.400
Thank you very much, Colonel,

00:22:46.799 --> 00:22:48.480
for giving us this opportunity.

00:22:48.480 --> 00:22:49.079
I can see that.

00:22:49.079 --> 00:22:49.920
After receiving the mission,

00:22:49.920 --> 00:22:51.319
the officers were all very excited.

00:22:53.039 --> 00:22:54.640
Tomorrow might be tough for everyone.

00:22:54.640 --> 00:22:56.799
The crash site is halfway up the mountain.

00:22:56.960 --> 00:22:58.480
There is a difficult mountain path to traverse.

00:22:58.480 --> 00:22:59.240
So prepare plenty of

00:22:59.240 --> 00:23:00.480
tools for clearing the path.

00:23:00.480 --> 00:23:01.119
Yes, sir.

00:23:01.119 --> 00:23:02.000
I'll tell them to get ready.

00:23:02.000 --> 00:23:03.480
After arriving at the crash site,

00:23:03.480 --> 00:23:05.160
set up sentries around the perimeter.

00:23:05.160 --> 00:23:06.640
We will conduct an on-site investigation.

00:23:06.640 --> 00:23:07.640
So ensure the investigation tools

00:23:07.640 --> 00:23:09.039
are also fully prepared.

00:23:09.519 --> 00:23:10.799
How long do we need to stay

00:23:10.799 --> 00:23:12.400
at the crash site?

00:23:12.400 --> 00:23:13.240
According to my plan,

00:23:13.240 --> 00:23:14.480
just one day.

00:23:14.480 --> 00:23:15.480
We withdraw by evening.

00:23:15.920 --> 00:23:16.720
Yes, sir.

00:23:16.880 --> 00:23:17.759
I'll go instruct them.

00:23:17.759 --> 00:23:18.480
Mm.

00:23:23.720 --> 00:23:24.680
Captain Akino.

00:23:24.960 --> 00:23:25.880
Yes.

00:23:26.079 --> 00:23:27.160
Thank you for your hard work.

00:23:59.319 --> 00:24:02.160
Seeing the ink on Akino Kawami's glove,

00:24:02.400 --> 00:24:03.839
Wumu realized

00:24:03.839 --> 00:24:05.400
that not only was the Police Battalion

00:24:05.400 --> 00:24:07.160
relentlessly pursuing him,

00:24:07.359 --> 00:24:09.720
but even the outwardly gentle Fujita

00:24:09.720 --> 00:24:11.880
was acting in the shadows.

00:24:12.279 --> 00:24:14.680
However, for Fujita,

00:24:14.920 --> 00:24:16.599
compared to Wumu's identity,

00:24:16.720 --> 00:24:19.279
he was more afraid the Palace special envoy's

00:24:19.279 --> 00:24:21.880
investigation into Osumi Mineo's death

00:24:22.359 --> 00:24:23.359
would bring him

00:24:23.559 --> 00:24:25.839
unpredictable trouble.

00:24:28.799 --> 00:24:30.240
Where do you think that person from the cave

00:24:30.240 --> 00:24:32.039
is hiding right now?

00:24:33.880 --> 00:24:38.359
I'm not sure where he might be hiding.

00:24:38.759 --> 00:24:39.319
Please.

00:24:39.880 --> 00:24:40.880
Thanks.

00:24:41.480 --> 00:24:42.480
However,

00:24:42.480 --> 00:24:45.799
what feels very obvious is that

00:24:46.279 --> 00:24:48.680
it seems this American

00:24:49.960 --> 00:24:53.799
is right under our noses,

00:24:54.400 --> 00:24:58.799
yet we just can't catch him.

00:25:00.119 --> 00:25:00.799
If that

00:25:00.799 --> 00:25:01.880
small smuggling boat from Macau, China

00:25:02.480 --> 00:25:04.599
came to pick up that downed American,

00:25:04.880 --> 00:25:07.039
after this failed operation,

00:25:07.880 --> 00:25:08.559
they will definitely have

00:25:08.559 --> 00:25:09.720
a next attempt.

00:25:11.119 --> 00:25:12.000
Moreover,

00:25:13.119 --> 00:25:15.079
arranging such an action will be urgent.

00:25:16.519 --> 00:25:17.519
Captain,

00:25:20.279 --> 00:25:21.400
are you saying

00:25:21.640 --> 00:25:24.079
the Juntong operation from Macau, China today

00:25:24.279 --> 00:25:25.000
is related to

00:25:25.000 --> 00:25:26.599
this American on our island?

00:25:27.519 --> 00:25:28.519
It's hard to say right now.

00:25:35.920 --> 00:25:37.039
It looks like

00:25:38.279 --> 00:25:40.200
between the island and Macau, China,

00:25:41.319 --> 00:25:43.039
there is a very close

00:25:43.519 --> 00:25:46.480
communication channel.

00:26:08.519 --> 00:26:09.200
Colonel.

00:26:10.519 --> 00:26:13.359
Huangyang Mountain is just ahead.

00:26:20.720 --> 00:26:21.839
Prepare to go ashore.

00:26:22.119 --> 00:26:22.880
Yes, sir.

00:26:23.799 --> 00:26:24.799
Tell everyone.

00:26:25.640 --> 00:26:27.039
Prepare to go ashore.

00:26:31.920 --> 00:26:33.480
Have you been to this place before?

00:26:33.559 --> 00:26:34.640
Yes.

00:26:35.119 --> 00:26:36.400
Are you familiar with the terrain?

00:26:37.000 --> 00:26:38.200
Yes.

00:26:39.400 --> 00:26:40.720
Are you all locals?

00:26:41.519 --> 00:26:42.480
Yes, we are.

00:26:45.079 --> 00:26:46.039
Commander Yuan.

00:26:46.319 --> 00:26:47.160
Here.

00:26:49.359 --> 00:26:50.160
Wait a minute.

00:26:50.160 --> 00:26:51.079
Have the brothers set up an ambush at...

00:26:51.079 --> 00:26:52.079
...this location.

00:26:52.319 --> 00:26:53.400
Let the Japs in.

00:26:54.480 --> 00:26:55.480
After the Japs enter...

00:26:55.480 --> 00:26:56.559
I have one requirement.

00:26:57.160 --> 00:26:58.279
Don't seek to wipe them out.

00:26:58.799 --> 00:27:00.480
Just scatter them.

00:27:01.559 --> 00:27:02.279
Scatter them?

00:27:02.279 --> 00:27:02.839
Yes.

00:27:03.799 --> 00:27:04.720
Chief Shen.

00:27:05.680 --> 00:27:06.880
The Japs' firepower...

00:27:06.880 --> 00:27:08.400
...is much stronger than ours.

00:27:08.400 --> 00:27:10.039
What if we can't scatter them?

00:27:11.119 --> 00:27:12.119
My current intelligence...

00:27:12.119 --> 00:27:13.720
...doesn't say how many Japs are coming.

00:27:14.480 --> 00:27:15.799
Anyway, deploy as many men...

00:27:15.799 --> 00:27:16.680
...as possible.

00:27:16.839 --> 00:27:18.519
We must overwhelm them with our momentum.

00:27:19.000 --> 00:27:20.039
How many men can you mobilize?

00:27:21.119 --> 00:27:22.480
How many men can you mobilize?

00:27:22.480 --> 00:27:23.759
The Provisional Seventh Detachment...

00:27:24.000 --> 00:27:25.680
...the Communist troop I mentioned.

00:27:25.680 --> 00:27:26.880
Should we call them over too?

00:27:26.880 --> 00:27:27.640
Forget about that.

00:27:28.160 --> 00:27:29.880
This is a classified operation.

00:27:29.880 --> 00:27:31.039
Don't let them participate.

00:27:31.319 --> 00:27:32.240
Apart from them...

00:27:32.240 --> 00:27:33.119
...how many men can come?

00:27:33.400 --> 00:27:35.400
Besides the Provisional Seventh Detachment...

00:27:35.400 --> 00:27:37.400
...the Fifth and Sixth Detachments have arrived.

00:27:38.319 --> 00:27:39.400
The Fourth and Eighth Detachments...

00:27:39.400 --> 00:27:40.559
...are on their way.

00:27:40.799 --> 00:27:41.920
They'll arrive very soon.

00:27:42.039 --> 00:27:42.640
How many men?

00:27:42.680 --> 00:27:43.319
Don't worry.

00:27:43.319 --> 00:27:44.559
At least a few hundred.

00:27:45.519 --> 00:27:46.160
Hmm.

00:27:47.359 --> 00:27:48.039
Fine.

00:27:48.200 --> 00:27:49.480
Go arrange it quickly.

00:27:49.559 --> 00:27:50.640
I'll go check the terrain.

00:27:51.000 --> 00:27:51.759
Okay.

00:28:04.359 --> 00:28:05.359
Excuse me.

00:28:06.799 --> 00:28:08.319
I asked the Base Operations Section.

00:28:08.319 --> 00:28:09.319
At nine o'clock this morning...

00:28:09.319 --> 00:28:10.119
...Colonel Wumu led some men...

00:28:10.119 --> 00:28:11.480
...to the Huangyang Mountain area.

00:28:11.640 --> 00:28:13.720
To the site of Admiral Osumi's crash...

00:28:13.720 --> 00:28:14.880
...to re-survey and measure it.

00:28:14.880 --> 00:28:16.480
Wait, wait, wait.

00:28:16.799 --> 00:28:18.559
Are you joking?

00:28:19.240 --> 00:28:20.240
Sasaki.

00:28:20.839 --> 00:28:22.559
Does Commander Fujita know about this?

00:28:22.559 --> 00:28:23.160
It was approved by the Commander.

00:28:23.160 --> 00:28:23.920
Approved?

00:28:25.880 --> 00:28:28.319
What a coincidence.

00:28:29.799 --> 00:28:30.599
The Juntong agents...

00:28:30.599 --> 00:28:32.079
...rushed back to Zhongshan from Macau.

00:28:33.799 --> 00:28:34.640
Our special envoy...

00:28:34.640 --> 00:28:35.920
...is also rushing to Zhongshan from the island.

00:28:37.519 --> 00:28:38.480
Captain.

00:28:38.680 --> 00:28:41.640
Then what should we do?

00:28:52.559 --> 00:28:55.119
What exactly are they doing there?

00:28:59.920 --> 00:29:02.200
Could it be that...

00:29:02.839 --> 00:29:06.000
...we should go to Huangyang Mountain too?

00:29:09.599 --> 00:29:10.880
The mantis stalks the cicada...

00:29:13.079 --> 00:29:14.799
...with the oriole behind.

00:29:14.799 --> 00:29:15.799
Exactly.

00:29:17.319 --> 00:29:18.640
We are the oriole.

00:29:19.960 --> 00:29:20.960
Understood.

00:29:23.839 --> 00:29:24.839
Sasaki.

00:29:24.839 --> 00:29:25.839
Yes.

00:29:26.519 --> 00:29:28.079
There is one more crucial matter.

00:29:41.480 --> 00:29:42.480
Understood.

00:29:52.599 --> 00:29:55.680
What exactly are they doing there?

00:30:30.200 --> 00:30:31.279
Report.

00:30:32.720 --> 00:30:33.359
Report, Excellency.

00:30:33.359 --> 00:30:34.960
The crash site is just ahead.

00:30:35.160 --> 00:30:35.839
Good.

00:30:48.319 --> 00:30:48.920
How is it going?

00:30:49.039 --> 00:30:49.759
Sir.

00:30:49.759 --> 00:30:50.559
It's almost ready.

00:30:53.519 --> 00:30:54.119
Over there.

00:30:54.119 --> 00:30:55.119
Add another machine gun.

00:30:55.240 --> 00:30:56.000
Yes, sir.

00:30:57.359 --> 00:30:59.000
Deploy another squad over there.

00:30:59.000 --> 00:30:59.680
Yes, sir.

00:31:00.880 --> 00:31:01.680
Chief Shen.

00:31:02.279 --> 00:31:04.039
That is the plane's crash site.

00:31:17.640 --> 00:31:18.920
Coming up from the foot of the mountain.

00:31:18.920 --> 00:31:20.599
Is that the only road?

00:31:21.480 --> 00:31:22.200
Yes.

00:31:22.640 --> 00:31:23.559
To enter this valley.

00:31:23.559 --> 00:31:24.680
That is the only road.

00:31:25.480 --> 00:31:26.559
Pass on my order.

00:31:26.559 --> 00:31:28.319
After the Japanese enter the encirclement,

00:31:29.240 --> 00:31:31.920
our men are only allowed to kill Japanese soldiers.

00:31:32.359 --> 00:31:34.079
Do not shoot the Japanese officers.

00:31:34.079 --> 00:31:35.559
Nor are you allowed to use bayonets

00:31:35.559 --> 00:31:36.519
to stab Japanese officers.

00:31:37.880 --> 00:31:39.559
You are not allowed to kill Japanese officers.

00:31:40.000 --> 00:31:42.160
Then how am I supposed to fight this battle?

00:31:42.160 --> 00:31:43.480
Just pass on my order.

00:32:00.480 --> 00:32:01.480
Pass the order down.

00:32:02.680 --> 00:32:04.519
When the Japanese enter the encirclement,

00:32:04.839 --> 00:32:06.240
only kill the soldiers.

00:32:06.759 --> 00:32:08.680
Do not kill the Japanese officers.

00:32:08.759 --> 00:32:09.640
And absolutely no bayonets

00:32:09.640 --> 00:32:10.799
to stab the Japanese officers to death.

00:32:10.880 --> 00:32:12.000
Must capture them alive.

00:32:12.000 --> 00:32:12.720
Yes, sir.

00:32:17.720 --> 00:32:18.720
Chief Shen.

00:32:18.960 --> 00:32:21.079
Why can't we kill the Jap officers?

00:32:34.039 --> 00:32:35.079
Report.

00:32:37.759 --> 00:32:38.319
Excellency.

00:32:38.319 --> 00:32:39.039
We've arrived.

00:32:39.039 --> 00:32:40.079
It's just ahead.

00:32:40.759 --> 00:32:41.519
Understood.

00:32:59.839 --> 00:33:00.680
They're coming.

00:33:04.519 --> 00:33:05.279
Should we fire?

00:33:05.759 --> 00:33:06.359
Don't fire yet.

00:33:06.359 --> 00:33:06.839
Hold steady.

00:33:06.839 --> 00:33:07.880
Let them come in.

00:33:18.640 --> 00:33:19.319
Thank you for your hard work.

00:33:19.319 --> 00:33:20.240
We've finally arrived.

00:33:20.319 --> 00:33:21.400
You've worked hard too.

00:33:21.400 --> 00:33:22.119
Let's go.

00:33:55.599 --> 00:33:57.160
More than a year has passed.

00:33:57.559 --> 00:33:59.480
and still, not a blade of grass grows here.

00:34:00.039 --> 00:34:01.880
It shows that when the plane crashed here...

00:34:01.880 --> 00:34:03.839
how intense the fire was.

00:34:04.480 --> 00:34:07.480
It is said that on the day of the crash last year...

00:34:07.480 --> 00:34:08.400
the fire on Huangyang Mountain

00:34:08.400 --> 00:34:10.559
continued to burn for nearly a day.

00:34:11.480 --> 00:34:13.000
A large patch of green trees on this slope...

00:34:13.000 --> 00:34:13.880
were all in this disaster...

00:34:13.880 --> 00:34:15.280
burned down.

00:34:16.039 --> 00:34:17.760
It burned for so long.

00:34:21.960 --> 00:34:24.480
The circumstances of the crash...

00:34:25.159 --> 00:34:27.199
were even more tragic.

00:34:27.840 --> 00:34:29.280
Nine people lost their lives.

00:34:29.679 --> 00:34:31.039
Two generals.

00:34:32.119 --> 00:34:32.960
If you didn't see it with your own eyes,

00:34:32.960 --> 00:34:34.159
this crash site,

00:34:35.039 --> 00:34:37.480
you wouldn't have such a feeling.

00:34:41.159 --> 00:34:41.639
Colonel.

00:34:41.639 --> 00:34:42.559
Take cover, quickly!

00:34:43.320 --> 00:34:44.400
Who fired that shot?

00:34:44.639 --> 00:34:46.480
Anyone firing without orders will be court-martialed!

00:34:46.480 --> 00:34:47.519
Who fired?

00:34:47.519 --> 00:34:49.280
Do not fire without my order!

00:34:50.280 --> 00:34:51.199
All squads.

00:34:51.199 --> 00:34:52.239
Prepare for combat.

00:34:52.760 --> 00:34:53.679
There are enemies nearby.

00:34:53.960 --> 00:34:54.639
Yes, sir.

00:35:03.159 --> 00:35:05.079
Everyone take cover.

00:35:56.599 --> 00:35:57.239
Fire!

00:36:04.000 --> 00:36:04.760
Yuan Dai!

00:36:04.760 --> 00:36:05.800
Don't fire!

00:36:05.800 --> 00:36:07.119
Those are the Japs' scouts.

00:36:07.119 --> 00:36:08.519
Used for pathfinding.

00:36:21.239 --> 00:36:22.840
Ahead are the Chiang government's troops.

00:36:25.199 --> 00:36:25.920
Fire!

00:36:29.119 --> 00:36:31.639
Protect the Colonel!

00:37:04.320 --> 00:37:05.000
Wang Jia.

00:37:05.000 --> 00:37:06.320
Take a few brothers with you.

00:37:06.320 --> 00:37:07.480
Good marksmen.

00:37:07.639 --> 00:37:08.599
That Japanese officer

00:37:08.599 --> 00:37:09.480
and the Japs next to him,

00:37:09.480 --> 00:37:10.599
take them out for me.

00:37:32.079 --> 00:37:33.559
Watch your cover.

00:37:33.559 --> 00:37:34.559
Charge!

00:37:34.719 --> 00:37:36.320
Wipe them out!

00:38:14.760 --> 00:38:15.760
Brothers!

00:38:16.119 --> 00:38:17.320
Charge!

00:38:19.719 --> 00:38:20.880
Charge!

00:38:27.719 --> 00:38:28.599
Brothers!

00:38:28.599 --> 00:38:29.599
Go!

00:38:30.960 --> 00:38:33.480
Kill!

00:38:37.119 --> 00:38:39.119
Charge!

00:38:40.760 --> 00:38:44.320
Charge!

00:39:10.199 --> 00:39:11.159
Protect the radio!

00:39:11.360 --> 00:39:12.760
It must not fall into enemy hands!

00:39:12.760 --> 00:39:13.760
Yes!

00:40:56.159 --> 00:40:57.599
Wumu knew

00:40:57.599 --> 00:40:59.119
that one more hard push

00:40:59.119 --> 00:41:01.639
would allow a rendezvous with Chief Shen.

00:41:02.079 --> 00:41:03.159
At the very least,

00:41:03.159 --> 00:41:05.679
it could buy them two minutes.

00:41:06.280 --> 00:41:07.679
With that time,

00:41:07.679 --> 00:41:09.039
it would be enough.

00:41:31.000 --> 00:41:32.519
Watch out!

00:41:35.800 --> 00:41:36.800
At this moment,

00:41:36.800 --> 00:41:38.159
Wumu knew clearly

00:41:38.519 --> 00:41:39.320
that this mission,

00:41:39.320 --> 00:41:41.559
when the Special Police Unit's gunfire

00:41:41.559 --> 00:41:42.760
rang out,

00:41:42.760 --> 00:41:44.079
had already failed.

00:41:44.280 --> 00:41:46.000
He had to take action

00:41:46.119 --> 00:41:48.679
to eliminate Oshima Hiroshi's suspicion.

00:41:52.920 --> 00:41:54.159
Captain!

00:41:54.320 --> 00:41:55.480
Captain!

00:41:55.480 --> 00:41:56.719
Over here!

00:41:59.920 --> 00:42:00.920
Let's go!

00:42:02.840 --> 00:42:03.599
Colonel!

00:42:04.000 --> 00:42:05.000
After them!

00:42:17.119 --> 00:42:18.320
Hurry, go!

00:42:18.320 --> 00:42:19.920
Go, go!

00:42:27.039 --> 00:42:28.000
After them!

00:42:28.719 --> 00:42:29.480
After them!
