00:01:38.552 --> 00:01:39.591
I left everything behind

00:01:39.672 --> 00:01:41.672
to build Yuehai City with you

00:01:41.791 --> 00:01:44.151
to reach a new height in my life.

00:01:45.192 --> 00:01:46.151
But now...

00:01:46.912 --> 00:01:47.311
I...

00:01:53.711 --> 00:01:55.752
I... I...

00:01:55.912 --> 00:01:58.231
E-Enough. I understand.

00:01:58.552 --> 00:01:58.912
I...

00:01:58.951 --> 00:02:00.672
Xie, after all these years,

00:02:00.672 --> 00:02:03.632
how could I not understand you?

00:02:03.992 --> 00:02:06.231
Why are you acting like a child?

00:02:07.472 --> 00:02:08.631
Let's not talk about...

00:02:08.631 --> 00:02:09.191
Don't...

00:02:09.272 --> 00:02:10.911
Let's not talk about

00:02:11.631 --> 00:02:12.352
Li.

00:02:12.672 --> 00:02:13.591
But you three.

00:02:14.232 --> 00:02:16.311
I can't guarantee

00:02:16.672 --> 00:02:18.871
which one of you will be the Town Mayor.

00:02:19.512 --> 00:02:21.552
But Li Qiuping certainly won't

00:02:22.072 --> 00:02:23.232
take that position.

00:02:24.711 --> 00:02:26.552
I'm impressed. I knew I could trust you.

00:02:26.792 --> 00:02:28.711
But what if they assign her here?

00:02:29.352 --> 00:02:29.871
Mr. Zheng.

00:02:30.672 --> 00:02:32.552
Phone call from the county.

00:02:33.631 --> 00:02:34.672
See? Speak of the devil.

00:02:35.151 --> 00:02:36.072
They're calling you.

00:02:48.431 --> 00:02:48.792
Hello?

00:02:50.272 --> 00:02:50.751
Guan.

00:02:56.072 --> 00:02:57.631
Guan. Mr. Guan.

00:02:58.072 --> 00:02:58.952
I disagree.

00:02:59.272 --> 00:03:00.672
I firmly oppose this.

00:03:12.232 --> 00:03:12.751
It's decided?

00:03:16.992 --> 00:03:18.552
The Town Mayor is coming.

00:03:19.992 --> 00:03:21.311
Come on, take it easy.

00:03:21.392 --> 00:03:23.431
I believe the higher-ups
made this decision

00:03:23.512 --> 00:03:25.311
out of careful consideration...

00:03:55.832 --> 00:03:58.072
How do you feel about Li Qiuping
being the Town Mayor?

00:03:59.392 --> 00:04:00.312
You know how I feel.

00:04:01.176 --> 00:04:01.911
(Petition)

00:04:01.911 --> 00:04:02.392
Sign this.

00:04:06.232 --> 00:04:07.232
Petition.

00:04:08.072 --> 00:04:09.911
Mr. Zhao and esteemed leaders,

00:04:09.911 --> 00:04:13.832
please withdraw Li Qiuping's appointment
as Town Mayor of Yuehai.

00:04:15.751 --> 00:04:16.592
Zheng Decheng.

00:04:17.271 --> 00:04:18.552
Mr. Zheng, personally,

00:04:18.592 --> 00:04:20.592
I don't have a problem
with who becomes Town Mayor.

00:04:20.592 --> 00:04:23.592
Xie Chunlai.

00:04:24.672 --> 00:04:25.352
Will you sign it?

00:04:26.871 --> 00:04:27.311
Come on.

00:04:27.631 --> 00:04:29.792
We shouldn't
hinder Yuehai's development.

00:04:29.792 --> 00:04:30.672
The higher-ups...

00:04:30.751 --> 00:04:32.056
Lin Dongfu, what do you say?

00:04:32.472 --> 00:04:33.511
Does she know anything

00:04:33.712 --> 00:04:35.472
about engineering or road construction?

00:04:36.311 --> 00:04:37.672
I oppose the appointment.

00:04:38.152 --> 00:04:38.631
But

00:04:39.951 --> 00:04:41.912
I'm also against Xie Chunlai.

00:04:43.232 --> 00:04:43.712
It's okay.

00:04:43.712 --> 00:04:44.712
I'm against you as well.

00:04:44.751 --> 00:04:47.071
Come on, we'll settle this later.

00:05:01.792 --> 00:05:02.592
Wait, Mr. Zheng.

00:05:02.912 --> 00:05:04.311
I truly believe

00:05:04.672 --> 00:05:06.232
this isn't a good idea.

00:05:06.472 --> 00:05:07.472
We're all cadres.

00:05:07.511 --> 00:05:09.672
We shouldn't
violate the procedure, right?

00:05:09.831 --> 00:05:10.912
Discipline, you know?

00:05:11.191 --> 00:05:12.631
Procedure is extremely important.

00:05:19.992 --> 00:05:21.831
(Collective signing
of withdrawal petition)

00:05:21.831 --> 00:05:22.311
Zhang.

00:05:23.352 --> 00:05:24.631
Do you know where Mr. Guan is?

00:05:24.871 --> 00:05:25.831
He's in a meeting.

00:05:25.951 --> 00:05:26.831
Busy day.

00:05:26.912 --> 00:05:27.472
Thanks.

00:05:27.552 --> 00:05:28.032
No problem.

00:05:31.896 --> 00:05:34.200
(Conference room)

00:05:36.511 --> 00:05:38.152
Decheng, what's wrong?

00:05:39.592 --> 00:05:40.152
Guan.

00:05:40.631 --> 00:05:41.751
Do you have a minute?

00:05:42.032 --> 00:05:42.472
Yeah.

00:05:42.511 --> 00:05:44.831
It's about the candidates
for the Town Mayor position.

00:05:45.511 --> 00:05:46.871
You see...

00:05:48.232 --> 00:05:49.152
Save your breath.

00:05:49.672 --> 00:05:50.232
Get out.

00:05:50.271 --> 00:05:51.232
This isn't appropriate.

00:05:51.792 --> 00:05:52.271
Guan.

00:05:52.751 --> 00:05:53.311
Zheng Decheng.

00:05:53.712 --> 00:05:55.152
How dare you pull this trick?

00:05:55.672 --> 00:05:57.352
I told you clearly on the phone.

00:05:57.592 --> 00:05:58.992
This is an appointment.

00:05:59.592 --> 00:06:01.232
By higher-ups. Do you understand?

00:06:01.511 --> 00:06:03.712
How dare you organize a joint petition?

00:06:04.912 --> 00:06:07.592
Do you have no respect
for discipline and principle?

00:06:08.511 --> 00:06:10.152
I do. But she's the wrong choice.

00:06:10.152 --> 00:06:10.751
You can't...

00:06:14.311 --> 00:06:15.112
Give me a break!

00:06:19.071 --> 00:06:19.352
Hello.

00:06:19.352 --> 00:06:19.792
Mr. Guan.

00:06:20.472 --> 00:06:21.271
Get ready.

00:06:22.431 --> 00:06:23.071
I'm busy.

00:06:23.712 --> 00:06:24.391
Get out of here.

00:06:42.352 --> 00:06:44.271
Your mom said she loved this, right?

00:06:44.672 --> 00:06:45.311
Yeah.

00:06:45.672 --> 00:06:47.032
She keeps talking about it.

00:06:47.271 --> 00:06:48.271
Good to know.

00:06:48.511 --> 00:06:50.112
I wouldn't want to look insincere.

00:06:52.071 --> 00:06:54.271
Do you really think this will work?

00:06:54.511 --> 00:06:56.232
A smile is the best defense.

00:06:56.592 --> 00:06:57.712
Do you have a better idea?

00:06:58.792 --> 00:07:01.311
You know, my dad is easy to deal with,

00:07:01.751 --> 00:07:03.112
but my mom won't budge.

00:07:04.152 --> 00:07:06.311
Then I'll threaten her.

00:07:06.631 --> 00:07:07.871
I'm going all out for you.

00:07:09.311 --> 00:07:09.831
Liu.

00:07:13.472 --> 00:07:14.912
You've got to back me up.

00:07:15.311 --> 00:07:16.352
If they disagree,

00:07:16.631 --> 00:07:17.631
just run away from home

00:07:17.951 --> 00:07:19.032
and stay at my place.

00:07:19.271 --> 00:07:21.112
Liu. Let's still try
to persuade them first.

00:07:22.871 --> 00:07:23.951
Don't use the key.

00:07:24.232 --> 00:07:24.912
Knock first.

00:07:25.071 --> 00:07:26.152
They need to see me.

00:07:26.792 --> 00:07:27.152
Okay.

00:07:44.871 --> 00:07:45.352
Ms. Liu.

00:07:45.831 --> 00:07:46.472
Li.

00:07:46.831 --> 00:07:47.391
You're back.

00:07:47.712 --> 00:07:48.511
Come on in.

00:07:50.672 --> 00:07:51.232
Mr. Zheng.

00:07:51.871 --> 00:07:52.751
Why are you here?

00:07:53.672 --> 00:07:54.112
Come in.

00:07:56.712 --> 00:07:56.992
Mr. Li.

00:07:56.992 --> 00:07:58.511
You weren't at the office.

00:07:59.271 --> 00:08:02.152
So I asked for your home address.

00:08:02.472 --> 00:08:03.472
I just came here

00:08:03.712 --> 00:08:04.831
and you're back.

00:08:06.152 --> 00:08:07.751
You came to see me? What for?

00:08:08.271 --> 00:08:09.431
I wanted to talk to you.

00:08:09.552 --> 00:08:11.071
Mom, Dad.

00:08:11.552 --> 00:08:13.311
This is Zheng Decheng,
Secretary of Yuehai.

00:08:14.751 --> 00:08:16.751
I've met Uncle and Auntie

00:08:17.552 --> 00:08:18.672
and introduced myself.

00:08:18.912 --> 00:08:21.191
But we had barely talked

00:08:21.672 --> 00:08:22.672
by the time you came.

00:08:23.112 --> 00:08:24.672
Call me Ms. Yan.

00:08:31.232 --> 00:08:32.312
Alright, Ms. Yan.

00:08:32.791 --> 00:08:34.232
Call me Mr. Li.

00:08:34.472 --> 00:08:35.151
Okay, Mr. Li.

00:08:35.151 --> 00:08:35.631
Alright.

00:08:36.031 --> 00:08:36.952
Is this about work?

00:08:37.352 --> 00:08:38.232
If it is,

00:08:38.352 --> 00:08:39.631
let's talk at the office.

00:08:40.671 --> 00:08:41.271
Well...

00:08:43.271 --> 00:08:44.031
Talk in private.

00:08:44.432 --> 00:08:45.791
I'll keep Mr. Li and Ms. Yan

00:08:45.832 --> 00:08:46.432
company.

00:08:47.432 --> 00:08:48.271
It's fine.

00:08:48.551 --> 00:08:49.712
Talk right here.

00:08:49.952 --> 00:08:50.472
It's fine.

00:08:50.791 --> 00:08:51.352
Your water.

00:08:51.871 --> 00:08:52.511
Thank you.

00:08:52.511 --> 00:08:53.072
No problem.

00:08:53.112 --> 00:08:53.712
Go ahead.

00:08:59.352 --> 00:09:00.712
Mr. Zheng, please sit.

00:09:01.112 --> 00:09:01.992
- Okay.
- Sit here.

00:09:03.871 --> 00:09:04.751
Ms. Liu, sit.

00:09:05.631 --> 00:09:06.671
You're the guest here.

00:09:06.952 --> 00:09:07.271
Okay.

00:09:10.151 --> 00:09:10.712
Mr. Zheng.

00:09:11.151 --> 00:09:12.592
What can I do for you?

00:09:18.511 --> 00:09:19.312
Li,

00:09:20.112 --> 00:09:21.511
I'm here to tell you

00:09:22.432 --> 00:09:23.592
that I can't keep my job.

00:09:24.871 --> 00:09:25.432
Why not?

00:09:26.151 --> 00:09:26.791
You know,

00:09:27.112 --> 00:09:30.151
this job hasn't been easy for me.

00:09:30.992 --> 00:09:33.551
Scraping together funds wasn't easy.

00:09:34.072 --> 00:09:35.871
Building a city wasn't easy.

00:09:37.112 --> 00:09:39.631
But the main problem is

00:09:39.992 --> 00:09:42.312
that my three deputies are opposing it.

00:09:44.072 --> 00:09:45.551
You quit just because of that?

00:09:46.112 --> 00:09:46.992
What do they oppose?

00:09:48.232 --> 00:09:49.511
Your appointment.

00:09:59.911 --> 00:10:01.952
That doesn't make any sense.

00:10:02.352 --> 00:10:03.432
Why does my appointment

00:10:03.472 --> 00:10:05.511
have anything to do with your job?

00:10:05.911 --> 00:10:08.631
Because they all
want to be the Town Mayor.

00:10:10.751 --> 00:10:11.432
And?

00:10:11.751 --> 00:10:14.592
And they'll quit
if they don't stand a chance.

00:10:15.031 --> 00:10:15.712
If they quit,

00:10:16.031 --> 00:10:17.112
I can't build the city.

00:10:17.312 --> 00:10:18.192
In that case,

00:10:18.631 --> 00:10:20.631
I can't keep my job, right?

00:10:23.551 --> 00:10:24.151
Li,

00:10:25.072 --> 00:10:27.671
I'm begging you, okay?

00:10:28.031 --> 00:10:29.911
Please let me off the hook.

00:10:30.791 --> 00:10:34.671
I'll find a way to repay you, I promise.

00:10:35.992 --> 00:10:36.911
How about this?

00:10:37.232 --> 00:10:39.472
I'll recommend you to be the Secretary

00:10:39.791 --> 00:10:42.112
in the neighboring town
to be the one in charge.

00:10:42.151 --> 00:10:42.832
No need.

00:10:43.232 --> 00:10:45.192
If they quit, I'll help you.

00:10:45.911 --> 00:10:48.592
Mr. Zheng, I'm assigned to Yuehai
to support you.

00:10:48.871 --> 00:10:49.511
Rest assured.

00:10:49.712 --> 00:10:50.511
I'm still young.

00:10:50.871 --> 00:10:52.791
I have ample time and energy.

00:10:53.232 --> 00:10:55.712
I'll devote myself fully
to assisting your work.

00:11:00.312 --> 00:11:00.832
Yes.

00:11:01.751 --> 00:11:02.432
You're young.

00:11:03.511 --> 00:11:05.031
You're a delicate young lady.

00:11:05.871 --> 00:11:07.312
You know Yuehai Town.

00:11:07.751 --> 00:11:08.511
It's dirt-poor.

00:11:09.031 --> 00:11:10.031
Life is quite hard there.

00:11:10.352 --> 00:11:11.992
Scruffy guys like us

00:11:12.391 --> 00:11:15.031
barely eat decent meals
or get proper sleep.

00:11:15.352 --> 00:11:16.072
We keep running

00:11:16.511 --> 00:11:18.671
around the construction sites.

00:11:19.112 --> 00:11:20.511
You know...

00:11:20.511 --> 00:11:21.031
Mr. Zheng,

00:11:21.151 --> 00:11:23.151
you look down on Yuehai this much?

00:11:24.592 --> 00:11:26.072
I remember you once said

00:11:26.592 --> 00:11:30.511
that Yuehai has great potential
to be a thriving city.

00:11:31.072 --> 00:11:33.631
I don't think
it will remain poor for long.

00:11:37.911 --> 00:11:38.992
That's not what I meant.

00:11:44.871 --> 00:11:45.911
Let me be honest.

00:11:47.992 --> 00:11:49.631
Our veteran cadres in Yuehai

00:11:51.151 --> 00:11:51.952
have been working

00:11:52.671 --> 00:11:55.992
diligently for years,

00:11:56.391 --> 00:11:58.312
dedicating their lives.

00:11:58.832 --> 00:11:59.871
They finally

00:12:00.511 --> 00:12:01.992
have a chance for promotion

00:12:02.791 --> 00:12:03.871
and then you came

00:12:04.551 --> 00:12:05.551
to be the Town Mayor.

00:12:06.031 --> 00:12:08.391
Put yourself in their shoes.

00:12:08.712 --> 00:12:12.151
So how do you think
they are feeling now?

00:12:14.271 --> 00:12:14.791
Li.

00:12:16.151 --> 00:12:18.312
You're only in your thirties, right?

00:12:18.631 --> 00:12:19.952
No, you're not even thirty.

00:12:20.871 --> 00:12:22.112
The future is yours.

00:12:23.871 --> 00:12:24.952
So what?

00:12:26.832 --> 00:12:27.911
"So what?"

00:12:28.511 --> 00:12:30.432
What about those veterans?

00:12:31.031 --> 00:12:32.671
Young lady.

00:12:32.751 --> 00:12:34.031
I thought you were kind.

00:12:34.391 --> 00:12:36.031
How can you be so heartless?

00:12:36.511 --> 00:12:37.832
No matter what you think,

00:12:37.911 --> 00:12:39.952
I am the so-called "Little Woman".

00:12:40.992 --> 00:12:41.712
What is that?

00:12:42.271 --> 00:12:42.871
Little Woman.

00:12:43.432 --> 00:12:43.952
English.

00:12:46.031 --> 00:12:47.271
He knows English?

00:12:47.871 --> 00:12:48.472
Mr. Zheng.

00:12:48.712 --> 00:12:49.952
Let's cut to the chase.

00:12:50.192 --> 00:12:52.551
You're the one
who doesn't want me there, right?

00:12:53.271 --> 00:12:54.432
Well, let me tell you.

00:12:54.712 --> 00:12:57.151
I've been involved
in Yuehai's planning from the start.

00:12:57.391 --> 00:12:59.072
I've always wanted to go there.

00:12:59.751 --> 00:13:01.472
I'm definitely going.

00:13:02.112 --> 00:13:05.592
And your days of dictatorial rule
in Yuehai are numbered.

00:13:06.192 --> 00:13:07.592
If you keep trying to stop me,

00:13:08.072 --> 00:13:11.432
I won't just be competing
for the Town Mayor position.

00:13:11.592 --> 00:13:13.151
I'll be coming for your job.

00:13:14.712 --> 00:13:17.432
You stubborn lady.
Why won't you listen to reason?

00:13:21.271 --> 00:13:21.592
Fine.

00:13:22.271 --> 00:13:24.072
Even if you don't care about others,

00:13:24.391 --> 00:13:26.391
at least think about your parents.

00:13:27.271 --> 00:13:28.271
If you work in Yuehai,

00:13:29.312 --> 00:13:30.312
who will take care

00:13:30.472 --> 00:13:31.312
of your parents?

00:13:31.832 --> 00:13:32.391
Right?

00:13:32.832 --> 00:13:33.551
I believe

00:13:33.952 --> 00:13:34.992
they wouldn't agree

00:13:35.391 --> 00:13:38.151
for you to work in Yuehai, right?

00:14:01.592 --> 00:14:02.072
Liu Dan.

00:14:02.911 --> 00:14:04.391
I haven't seen you for ages.

00:14:07.391 --> 00:14:08.791
Once Qiuping goes to Yuehai,

00:14:09.352 --> 00:14:10.352
you must visit often.

00:14:12.631 --> 00:14:13.151
Of course.

00:14:18.911 --> 00:14:20.232
So this is your new leader?

00:14:20.832 --> 00:14:23.151
Auntie, I'm not her leader.

00:14:23.511 --> 00:14:25.031
We're just colleagues.

00:14:25.312 --> 00:14:25.992
I told you.

00:14:26.751 --> 00:14:27.992
Call me Ms. Yan.

00:14:28.992 --> 00:14:29.992
Alright, Ms. Yan.

00:14:30.352 --> 00:14:31.911
First, I'm still young.

00:14:32.911 --> 00:14:34.551
Second, I don't need being looked after.

00:14:35.712 --> 00:14:36.352
Mr. Zheng,

00:14:37.072 --> 00:14:38.511
once Qiuping is in Yuehai,

00:14:38.952 --> 00:14:40.992
please look out for her.

00:14:45.271 --> 00:14:46.871
Of course.

00:14:56.072 --> 00:14:56.992
When are you leaving?

00:14:57.952 --> 00:14:59.072
I'll see you off.

00:15:00.472 --> 00:15:02.432
Sweetie, I will see you off, too.

00:15:02.911 --> 00:15:04.592
We won't stand in the way.

00:15:05.432 --> 00:15:06.671
For truly great figures,

00:15:06.911 --> 00:15:07.832
look to this age alone.

00:15:08.712 --> 00:15:10.871
Go there and give it your all.

00:15:16.432 --> 00:15:19.112
Alright then. See you in Yuehai.

00:15:19.871 --> 00:15:22.472
Let's unite as one
and progress together.

00:15:22.911 --> 00:15:23.791
Progress together.

00:15:23.791 --> 00:15:24.151
Okay.

00:15:24.751 --> 00:15:25.352
Mr. Zheng.

00:15:26.151 --> 00:15:28.432
Take these with you and give them out.

00:15:28.911 --> 00:15:31.151
Consider it a gift from me.

00:15:31.432 --> 00:15:32.911
This is inappropriate.

00:15:32.911 --> 00:15:33.832
Just take them.

00:15:34.112 --> 00:15:34.871
It's the thought

00:15:35.192 --> 00:15:36.271
that counts.

00:15:36.472 --> 00:15:37.671
Besides, these

00:15:37.871 --> 00:15:39.031
are quite valuable.

00:15:39.391 --> 00:15:40.832
This is Qiuping's gesture.

00:15:41.112 --> 00:15:41.751
I'll carry them

00:15:41.992 --> 00:15:42.791
and see you off.

00:15:43.031 --> 00:15:43.432
Let's go.

00:15:43.592 --> 00:15:44.791
Alright, thank you.

00:15:44.871 --> 00:15:45.911
Well... I'm off.

00:15:45.911 --> 00:15:46.911
- Uncle, Auntie.
- Goodbye.

00:15:46.992 --> 00:15:48.592
Mr. Li, Ms. Yan.

00:15:48.911 --> 00:15:49.312
Okay.

00:15:50.031 --> 00:15:50.472
Bye.

00:15:50.712 --> 00:15:51.112
Bye.

00:15:52.151 --> 00:15:52.992
I need to thank you.

00:15:53.631 --> 00:15:55.151
You did what I wanted to do.

00:15:56.151 --> 00:15:56.871
What did I do?

00:15:57.751 --> 00:15:58.511
Good job.

00:16:01.271 --> 00:16:02.031
G-Goodbye.

00:16:08.832 --> 00:16:09.312
Look.

00:16:09.832 --> 00:16:11.791
Mr. Zheng brought so many treats.

00:16:13.192 --> 00:16:14.151
Where is he?

00:16:14.432 --> 00:16:15.352
- Yeah.
- In the restroom.

00:16:15.992 --> 00:16:16.832
So many snacks.

00:16:17.271 --> 00:16:18.031
So it's good news.

00:16:20.671 --> 00:16:21.112
Yeah.

00:16:21.671 --> 00:16:22.271
I bet

00:16:22.472 --> 00:16:23.751
there is good news.

00:16:24.312 --> 00:16:25.432
That's our Secretary.

00:16:26.592 --> 00:16:27.671
He is so thoughtful.

00:16:27.832 --> 00:16:28.671
He knows what I like.

00:16:29.151 --> 00:16:29.791
What is this?

00:16:29.832 --> 00:16:30.232
Candy.

00:16:30.271 --> 00:16:30.992
I-I love candy.

00:16:31.072 --> 00:16:31.631
- Come on.
- Come on.

00:16:31.671 --> 00:16:32.751
I didn't buy those.

00:16:33.391 --> 00:16:34.432
You didn't?

00:16:34.551 --> 00:16:35.232
Then who did?

00:16:35.352 --> 00:16:36.271
I got it.

00:16:36.911 --> 00:16:37.671
These are from

00:16:37.751 --> 00:16:38.472
a fellow villager.

00:16:38.592 --> 00:16:39.832
Everyone likes Mr. Zheng.

00:16:40.072 --> 00:16:40.631
Come on.

00:16:42.112 --> 00:16:42.791
Candy.

00:16:43.551 --> 00:16:46.432
♪We toast to victory together♪

00:16:47.952 --> 00:16:49.072
Candy.

00:16:50.031 --> 00:16:51.391
The new Town Mayor of Yuehai,

00:16:51.432 --> 00:16:52.280
Li Qiuping.

00:16:56.600 --> 00:16:57.312
She bought these.

00:17:01.271 --> 00:17:01.832
Take it.

00:17:02.151 --> 00:17:02.952
Go away.

00:17:05.472 --> 00:17:06.872
So it's finalized.

00:17:09.872 --> 00:17:11.311
Ms. Li is quite capable.

00:17:13.632 --> 00:17:14.311
She knows

00:17:14.831 --> 00:17:18.751
that an army marches on its stomach.

00:17:21.672 --> 00:17:24.952
These pastries are really nice.

00:17:28.551 --> 00:17:29.152
Everyone.

00:17:29.672 --> 00:17:31.071
Tomorrow is the ceremony.

00:17:31.511 --> 00:17:33.432
Keep working on your current tasks.

00:17:33.751 --> 00:17:35.351
We'll visit the band first, okay?

00:17:35.392 --> 00:17:36.031
Got it.

00:17:36.031 --> 00:17:36.311
Okay.

00:17:36.311 --> 00:17:36.912
Okay.

00:17:36.912 --> 00:17:37.551
Keep it up.

00:17:37.551 --> 00:17:40.536
(Yuehai Town People's Government,
Yuehai Town Committee)

00:17:42.511 --> 00:17:43.551
- So dangerous, Xie.
- What's up?

00:17:44.111 --> 00:17:45.031
Won't you wait

00:17:45.111 --> 00:17:45.791
for Ms. Li?

00:17:46.031 --> 00:17:47.152
You've got this.

00:17:49.551 --> 00:17:50.791
Me? Alone?

00:17:51.591 --> 00:17:52.712
What's wrong?

00:18:07.791 --> 00:18:08.311
Xie.

00:18:08.831 --> 00:18:11.311
I know you feel wronged about this.

00:18:11.392 --> 00:18:11.872
No, no.

00:18:11.872 --> 00:18:13.351
E-Enough. I know you do.

00:18:13.751 --> 00:18:14.831
I did promise you

00:18:15.031 --> 00:18:16.071
that position.

00:18:16.591 --> 00:18:18.111
I broke my word.

00:18:19.192 --> 00:18:20.152
I owe you an apology.

00:18:20.992 --> 00:18:21.511
I'm sorry.

00:18:21.632 --> 00:18:22.912
I know. It's not your fault.

00:18:23.071 --> 00:18:24.152
No. It is my fault.

00:18:24.311 --> 00:18:24.831
It is.

00:18:25.831 --> 00:18:26.351
I'm sorry.

00:18:33.992 --> 00:18:37.392
You need to face this, okay?

00:18:38.071 --> 00:18:38.472
What?

00:18:38.831 --> 00:18:39.511
Face it.

00:18:40.311 --> 00:18:40.751
Okay?

00:18:41.071 --> 00:18:42.192
- Okay.
- Okay.

00:18:42.432 --> 00:18:42.791
Okay.

00:18:58.111 --> 00:18:58.551
Xie.

00:19:00.831 --> 00:19:01.551
Rest assured.

00:19:02.952 --> 00:19:03.952
Li Qiuping

00:19:04.952 --> 00:19:06.952
has never known hardship.

00:19:07.351 --> 00:19:08.192
She's not like us.

00:19:08.872 --> 00:19:10.232
What is Yuehai like?

00:19:10.872 --> 00:19:11.872
Poor environment.

00:19:12.192 --> 00:19:13.591
How can she handle this?

00:19:13.632 --> 00:19:14.432
She can't handle it.

00:19:14.632 --> 00:19:15.392
Yeah.

00:19:15.791 --> 00:19:17.472
You mean, she won't stay long?

00:19:17.872 --> 00:19:18.712
I didn't say that.

00:19:18.952 --> 00:19:19.800
So what do you mean?

00:19:22.712 --> 00:19:24.031
I mean,

00:19:25.992 --> 00:19:28.192
Ms. Li will be here.

00:19:28.551 --> 00:19:30.311
You need to host her properly.

00:19:30.551 --> 00:19:31.992
Tend to her basic needs.

00:19:32.712 --> 00:19:34.472
Make sure she isn't mistreated

00:19:34.912 --> 00:19:37.511
and fully express our hospitality.

00:19:38.351 --> 00:19:40.992
But, don't overdo it.

00:19:42.472 --> 00:19:44.192
She won't be mistreated.

00:19:44.791 --> 00:19:45.511
I won't overdo it.

00:20:20.152 --> 00:20:20.712
Tied it up?

00:20:21.432 --> 00:20:22.912
Okay, don't let go.

00:20:24.672 --> 00:20:25.712
Let's do it right.

00:20:37.192 --> 00:20:37.672
Hello.

00:20:38.632 --> 00:20:39.751
Vendors aren't allowed.

00:20:39.872 --> 00:20:40.472
Move along.

00:20:43.311 --> 00:20:44.111
You misunderstood.

00:20:44.351 --> 00:20:45.791
I'm not a vendor, I'm...

00:20:47.831 --> 00:20:49.071
Hurry, come on.

00:20:49.271 --> 00:20:49.672
It's okay.

00:20:49.672 --> 00:20:50.192
Come on.

00:20:52.912 --> 00:20:53.511
Mr. Xie.

00:20:53.831 --> 00:20:54.472
We meet again.

00:20:55.551 --> 00:20:56.831
Our warmest welcome.

00:20:57.152 --> 00:20:58.031
This is Mayor Li.

00:20:58.351 --> 00:20:58.831
Mayor?

00:20:59.031 --> 00:21:00.551
This is Zhang, our publicity staff.

00:21:00.831 --> 00:21:01.831
Are you crazy?

00:21:02.031 --> 00:21:02.472
Sorry.

00:21:02.672 --> 00:21:03.311
It's alright.

00:21:03.551 --> 00:21:04.031
It's okay.

00:21:04.031 --> 00:21:05.351
Will you forgive him?

00:21:06.031 --> 00:21:06.831
Let's start over.

00:21:07.031 --> 00:21:07.632
Come on.

00:21:07.912 --> 00:21:08.511
Start over.

00:21:08.511 --> 00:21:09.192
It's fine.

00:21:09.392 --> 00:21:10.351
- But...
- It's okay.

00:21:10.712 --> 00:21:11.791
We were prepared.

00:21:11.912 --> 00:21:13.791
Look. Just a moment.

00:21:15.271 --> 00:21:15.672
Look.

00:21:19.912 --> 00:21:20.432
Ms. Li.

00:21:20.791 --> 00:21:22.751
We warmly welcome Ms. Li.

00:21:24.351 --> 00:21:25.111
Come here.

00:21:31.432 --> 00:21:31.992
Ms. Li.

00:21:33.192 --> 00:21:34.311
Heavy burden, huh?

00:21:35.192 --> 00:21:36.952
It's a heavy burden for all of us.

00:21:39.632 --> 00:21:40.872
Well said, Ms. Li.

00:21:41.351 --> 00:21:42.192
I could have

00:21:42.192 --> 00:21:43.031
sent a vehicle.

00:21:44.271 --> 00:21:45.712
We have vehicles?

00:21:46.031 --> 00:21:46.511
Well, no.

00:21:46.591 --> 00:21:48.472
I would have picked you up
with my motorcycle.

00:21:49.831 --> 00:21:51.192
I wouldn't let you walk here.

00:21:51.751 --> 00:21:53.751
If I didn't walk here,
you'd have to carry me.

00:21:56.912 --> 00:21:57.432
Wait.

00:21:57.432 --> 00:21:57.952
Don't.

00:21:58.271 --> 00:21:58.712
Okay.

00:22:00.912 --> 00:22:01.672
There's more?

00:22:10.791 --> 00:22:13.912
- Welcome!
- Welcome!

00:22:14.192 --> 00:22:14.992
Okay, stop.

00:22:18.591 --> 00:22:19.271
Welcome!

00:22:19.672 --> 00:22:20.152
Ms. Li.

00:22:20.551 --> 00:22:21.392
Time is tight.

00:22:21.712 --> 00:22:23.311
Everyone's busy with the ceremony

00:22:23.751 --> 00:22:24.632
tomorrow.

00:22:24.992 --> 00:22:25.831
It's a token gesture

00:22:26.192 --> 00:22:27.511
and a rehearsal.

00:22:27.712 --> 00:22:28.472
But of course,

00:22:28.472 --> 00:22:29.912
we must give you a warm welcome.

00:22:29.912 --> 00:22:31.632
We have to do what's proper, right?

00:22:32.712 --> 00:22:33.992
It is indeed a token gesture.

00:22:35.031 --> 00:22:36.311
Thank you so much, Mr. Xie.

00:22:36.472 --> 00:22:37.031
Meng, come on.

00:22:37.392 --> 00:22:38.912
Share Ms. Li's burden.

00:22:39.111 --> 00:22:39.432
Got it.

00:22:39.672 --> 00:22:40.088
No need.

00:22:40.351 --> 00:22:41.511
I've got this.

00:22:41.511 --> 00:22:42.031
All set.

00:22:42.472 --> 00:22:43.511
Ms. Li, let me help you.

00:22:43.952 --> 00:22:44.872
It's fine. I got this.

00:22:45.311 --> 00:22:45.712
- Wait.
- Let's go.

00:22:46.472 --> 00:22:46.872
This way.

00:22:47.192 --> 00:22:47.712
That way?

00:22:48.952 --> 00:22:49.392
This way.

00:22:49.712 --> 00:22:50.511
Where are we going?

00:22:50.632 --> 00:22:51.511
Binjiang Guesthouse.

00:22:52.472 --> 00:22:53.271
Guesthouse?

00:22:53.551 --> 00:22:54.751
You stay at the guesthouse?

00:22:55.192 --> 00:22:56.071
We live here.

00:22:57.311 --> 00:22:58.992
Mr. Zheng, Mr. Lin, Mr. Tan,

00:22:59.111 --> 00:23:00.591
Mr. Xie, I, and Qingtian

00:23:00.591 --> 00:23:01.351
live in the dorm.

00:23:01.551 --> 00:23:02.831
I'll stay with you.

00:23:03.111 --> 00:23:03.551
I...

00:23:04.551 --> 00:23:05.992
We haven't cleaned up the room.

00:23:06.271 --> 00:23:07.071
It's a mess.

00:23:07.351 --> 00:23:08.551
The guesthouse is better.

00:23:08.831 --> 00:23:09.432
It's fine.

00:23:09.591 --> 00:23:10.992
I can clean it up myself.

00:23:11.591 --> 00:23:12.311
It's too small.

00:23:13.791 --> 00:23:14.912
What?

00:23:15.472 --> 00:23:17.111
Ms. Li, you want to stay in the dorm?

00:23:18.831 --> 00:23:19.952
They ate everything.

00:23:22.111 --> 00:23:23.192
Am I late?

00:23:23.632 --> 00:23:24.511
Is there no food left?

00:23:25.632 --> 00:23:26.511
You must be Ms. Li.

00:23:28.071 --> 00:23:29.152
I'm so sorry.

00:23:29.152 --> 00:23:30.712
Dinner time has passed.

00:23:31.311 --> 00:23:32.271
That's all there is.

00:23:32.271 --> 00:23:32.791
That's all?

00:23:32.992 --> 00:23:34.271
Ms. Li, here for dinner?

00:23:36.751 --> 00:23:37.031
Well...

00:23:37.632 --> 00:23:38.071
All gone.

00:23:39.872 --> 00:23:40.432
Come on.

00:23:42.031 --> 00:23:43.111
Ms. Xiao, what's going on?

00:23:43.591 --> 00:23:44.751
Didn't I tell you

00:23:44.791 --> 00:23:45.632
to prepare more?

00:23:45.952 --> 00:23:46.992
The ceremony is tomorrow.

00:23:47.031 --> 00:23:48.192
Can you handle this?

00:23:49.751 --> 00:23:51.071
I did make extra.

00:23:51.311 --> 00:23:52.551
You only took two portions.

00:23:53.351 --> 00:23:54.351
One extra bun here,

00:23:54.551 --> 00:23:55.472
one extra scoop there,

00:23:55.511 --> 00:23:56.311
everything's gone.

00:23:58.152 --> 00:23:59.152
Well, Ms. Li.

00:23:59.392 --> 00:24:01.551
Everyone was exhausted today.

00:24:01.712 --> 00:24:02.992
Some didn't even get lunch.

00:24:03.511 --> 00:24:04.551
So they ate everything.

00:24:04.591 --> 00:24:05.712
You might be a bit late.

00:24:06.271 --> 00:24:06.831
Right, Xiaoli.

00:24:06.952 --> 00:24:07.992
Come here.

00:24:08.712 --> 00:24:09.872
We're so sorry.

00:24:10.311 --> 00:24:10.791
Yeah?

00:24:10.992 --> 00:24:11.751
Tell me.

00:24:11.992 --> 00:24:13.872
Is Ms. Xiao's cooking good or not?

00:24:14.551 --> 00:24:15.031
Be honest.

00:24:15.392 --> 00:24:16.152
Everything is gone.

00:24:16.472 --> 00:24:17.271
It must be good.

00:24:18.551 --> 00:24:20.392
I'm telling you, it's really not good.

00:24:20.472 --> 00:24:21.912
You're lucky you didn't get any.

00:24:22.432 --> 00:24:24.271
Meng Xiaoli.
Take Ms. Li to a restaurant.

00:24:24.351 --> 00:24:24.591
Go on.

00:24:24.992 --> 00:24:25.688
Hasn't she eaten?

00:24:25.831 --> 00:24:26.351
No.

00:24:26.351 --> 00:24:27.111
Ms. Li, let's go.

00:24:27.392 --> 00:24:28.111
No need.

00:24:29.071 --> 00:24:30.712
Can I use the kitchen?

00:24:31.472 --> 00:24:32.192
This is yours.

00:24:32.392 --> 00:24:32.952
Go ahead.

00:24:41.992 --> 00:24:42.872
Need help, Ms. Li?

00:24:43.632 --> 00:24:44.071
No need.

00:25:18.031 --> 00:25:18.831
Smells amazing.

00:25:18.872 --> 00:25:19.472
It's hot.

00:25:20.591 --> 00:25:21.311
Want a bite?

00:25:22.071 --> 00:25:22.712
Just one bite.

00:25:22.992 --> 00:25:23.672
Don't.

00:25:23.672 --> 00:25:24.591
I want to try it.

00:25:24.632 --> 00:25:25.152
Just eat.

00:25:25.271 --> 00:25:25.672
It's okay.

00:25:33.351 --> 00:25:34.152
It's good.

00:25:35.351 --> 00:25:36.031
Ms. Xiao, here.

00:25:37.232 --> 00:25:38.392
Much tastier than yours.

00:25:44.831 --> 00:25:45.751
Stop eating her food.

00:25:45.912 --> 00:25:46.712
She hasn't eaten.

00:25:47.432 --> 00:25:47.952
No, thanks.

00:25:48.152 --> 00:25:48.712
One bite.

00:25:49.031 --> 00:25:49.712
It's good.

00:25:50.031 --> 00:25:50.751
I'm full.

00:25:52.111 --> 00:25:53.912
You double-checked these?

00:25:54.152 --> 00:25:54.791
Yeah.

00:26:03.712 --> 00:26:05.472
We should all match tomorrow.

00:26:06.831 --> 00:26:07.392
White shirts.

00:26:07.672 --> 00:26:08.031
Alright?

00:26:09.031 --> 00:26:09.872
Stop

00:26:10.031 --> 00:26:12.472
emphasizing the dressing code.

00:26:12.712 --> 00:26:13.872
It's pointless.

00:26:13.912 --> 00:26:14.831
How is it pointless?

00:26:14.872 --> 00:26:16.551
We're discussing important issues.

00:26:16.791 --> 00:26:18.912
Don't distract us.
There's so much work...

00:26:19.071 --> 00:26:20.031
Uniform clothing

00:26:20.111 --> 00:26:22.152
represents our collective spirit.

00:26:22.192 --> 00:26:22.791
We know that.

00:26:22.791 --> 00:26:24.192
We'll be in white shirts in photos.

00:26:24.192 --> 00:26:25.432
How do we do that?

00:26:25.751 --> 00:26:27.511
We will dress up for the ceremony.

00:26:27.712 --> 00:26:29.872
You don't need to demand anything.

00:26:29.872 --> 00:26:30.392
Tan.

00:26:30.472 --> 00:26:30.712
Okay.

00:26:30.751 --> 00:26:31.992
Just be clean and neat.

00:26:32.152 --> 00:26:33.551
Let's get back to business.

00:26:33.591 --> 00:26:34.632
There's another thing.

00:26:34.672 --> 00:26:37.591
Mr. Tan estimated 4,000 people,
but there will be more people.

00:26:37.632 --> 00:26:38.632
How do you know?

00:26:38.712 --> 00:26:39.472
On what basis?

00:26:39.591 --> 00:26:41.712
Only 5,000 people came
to the Spring Festival

00:26:41.791 --> 00:26:42.751
market.

00:26:42.791 --> 00:26:43.791
You can't refer to that.

00:26:44.031 --> 00:26:46.791
Don't underestimate the enthusiasm
of the Yuehai people.

00:26:46.952 --> 00:26:48.872
Everyone should be vigilant

00:26:48.912 --> 00:26:50.152
and responsible.

00:26:50.392 --> 00:26:52.872
So, let's double-check the procedures.

00:26:53.031 --> 00:26:53.712
Let's continue.

00:26:53.992 --> 00:26:55.031
It's important.

00:26:55.031 --> 00:26:55.992
The procedure.

00:26:56.111 --> 00:26:56.432
Yeah.

00:26:56.432 --> 00:26:57.071
The procedure.

00:26:57.952 --> 00:27:01.432
- First, the band performs.
- Right.

00:27:01.632 --> 00:27:03.712
Brass band plus gongs and drums.

00:27:03.791 --> 00:27:05.031
After both bands play...

00:27:05.111 --> 00:27:05.831
Wait a moment.

00:27:05.912 --> 00:27:07.551
After both bands play...

00:27:07.632 --> 00:27:07.952
Wait.

00:27:08.271 --> 00:27:10.712
Then flower presentation,
ribbon-cutting. The leader's speech.

00:27:10.791 --> 00:27:11.632
Mr. Xie.

00:27:11.912 --> 00:27:12.992
We need to applaud.

00:27:13.712 --> 00:27:14.392
Mr. Xie.

00:27:15.111 --> 00:27:15.551
Right?

00:27:15.591 --> 00:27:16.712
- Say something.
- Without this,

00:27:17.031 --> 00:27:18.152
- how can he...
- I feel

00:27:18.232 --> 00:27:20.031
- The town fellows...
- that's completely wrong.

00:27:20.311 --> 00:27:21.031
Aren't you...

00:27:21.271 --> 00:27:23.311
The people need to applaud.

00:27:23.392 --> 00:27:23.751
They...

00:27:24.031 --> 00:27:24.992
We're talking...

00:27:25.271 --> 00:27:25.912
Come out here.

00:27:25.912 --> 00:27:26.432
Get them

00:27:26.511 --> 00:27:26.992
hyped.

00:27:27.152 --> 00:27:27.952
Mr. Zheng.

00:27:28.392 --> 00:27:31.311
- Mr. Zheng.
- Stack these boxes in a row, okay?

00:27:31.311 --> 00:27:33.351
Mr. Zheng. Xie is being difficult again.

00:27:34.192 --> 00:27:35.071
Why so many pigeons?

00:27:35.192 --> 00:27:35.912
Extra food?

00:27:36.152 --> 00:27:37.712
You only think about eating.

00:27:37.952 --> 00:27:39.831
I had Qian Changyuan buy these pigeons.

00:27:40.351 --> 00:27:41.872
We'll release doves of peace

00:27:42.111 --> 00:27:43.271
at the ceremony.

00:27:43.392 --> 00:27:44.031
For the vibe.

00:27:44.192 --> 00:27:44.872
Okay.

00:27:44.872 --> 00:27:45.311
Mr. Zheng.

00:27:45.351 --> 00:27:46.432
You're mixing things up.

00:27:46.551 --> 00:27:47.392
Doves of peace?

00:27:47.432 --> 00:27:48.511
That's so irrelevant.

00:27:48.511 --> 00:27:49.432
This is good.

00:27:49.712 --> 00:27:51.071
Call them doves of prosperity.

00:27:51.071 --> 00:27:51.511
Exactly.

00:27:51.791 --> 00:27:52.992
Doves of prosperity.

00:27:53.511 --> 00:27:54.632
Great minds think alike.

00:27:58.111 --> 00:27:58.831
Li.

00:27:59.071 --> 00:28:00.031
When did you get here?

00:28:00.232 --> 00:28:00.831
Why didn't I...

00:28:01.632 --> 00:28:02.872
I mean, Ms. Li.

00:28:04.392 --> 00:28:06.031
Why didn't any of you tell me?

00:28:06.751 --> 00:28:07.632
You left early.

00:28:07.672 --> 00:28:08.071
Yeah.

00:28:09.632 --> 00:28:10.472
Come on in.

00:28:10.472 --> 00:28:11.071
Come in.

00:28:11.071 --> 00:28:12.152
Let me introduce you.

00:28:12.432 --> 00:28:13.432
Formally.

00:28:14.912 --> 00:28:15.311
Come on.

00:28:15.472 --> 00:28:16.511
Hurry up.

00:28:17.992 --> 00:28:19.111
Hurry up. Stand there.

00:28:20.152 --> 00:28:20.751
Applause.

00:28:21.311 --> 00:28:21.831
Alright.

00:28:22.351 --> 00:28:23.192
Let's

00:28:23.591 --> 00:28:25.351
formally welcome Ms. Li.

00:28:26.031 --> 00:28:26.952
Li Qiuping

00:28:26.992 --> 00:28:29.952
is a highly educated graduate
of Dongjiang University.

00:28:30.472 --> 00:28:31.511
She's the only graduate

00:28:31.551 --> 00:28:33.831
from a top-tier university
in our entire county.

00:28:34.392 --> 00:28:35.791
She was a secretary in the county.

00:28:36.232 --> 00:28:38.432
She's highly educated and talented.

00:28:38.712 --> 00:28:40.071
She speaks foreign languages.

00:28:40.672 --> 00:28:41.591
Li Qiuping.

00:28:41.672 --> 00:28:44.432
Why don't you introduce yourself
in a foreign language?

00:28:44.751 --> 00:28:45.192
Okay?

00:28:45.271 --> 00:28:46.031
- Applaud.
- Alright!

00:28:46.071 --> 00:28:46.912
- Alright!
- Alright!

00:28:52.992 --> 00:28:54.551
I know none of you welcome me.

00:28:54.672 --> 00:28:56.952
Nor do you believe
I can be a good Town Mayor.

00:28:57.672 --> 00:28:58.351
But if you think

00:28:58.432 --> 00:29:00.952
I'll leave after just a few days,

00:29:01.111 --> 00:29:02.432
then you're underestimating me.

00:29:03.071 --> 00:29:05.551
I'm staying put right here.

00:29:08.952 --> 00:29:09.368
That's it?

00:29:09.912 --> 00:29:10.271
Alright.

00:29:10.591 --> 00:29:11.071
Alright.

00:29:12.712 --> 00:29:15.111
Ms. Li speaks great English.

00:29:16.351 --> 00:29:16.831
Ms. Li.

00:29:17.351 --> 00:29:17.831
Bravo.

00:29:18.311 --> 00:29:19.192
What did you say?

00:29:21.031 --> 00:29:22.111
It means "good".

00:29:22.152 --> 00:29:22.992
You're acquainted.

00:29:23.912 --> 00:29:24.672
You speak English?

00:29:25.511 --> 00:29:26.672
What did Ms. Li say?

00:29:27.872 --> 00:29:30.311
I don't know.
Because she didn't speak English.

00:29:30.952 --> 00:29:32.071
It sounded like French.

00:29:32.111 --> 00:29:32.872
French?

00:29:33.351 --> 00:29:33.751
Yeah.

00:29:34.591 --> 00:29:35.271
That's amazing.

00:29:35.791 --> 00:29:37.392
She isn't an easy one to handle.

00:29:37.992 --> 00:29:40.511
I won't repeat tomorrow's work plan.

00:29:40.791 --> 00:29:41.912
Finish your work

00:29:41.992 --> 00:29:42.992
and rest early.

00:29:43.192 --> 00:29:45.232
Get ready to win
our first battle tomorrow.

00:29:45.432 --> 00:29:45.712
Okay.

00:29:45.912 --> 00:29:46.511
- Okay.
- That's it.

00:29:46.751 --> 00:29:47.912
- Okay.
- Okay.

00:29:49.152 --> 00:29:50.031
That's it?

00:29:56.912 --> 00:29:57.432
Mr. Zheng.

00:29:57.831 --> 00:29:58.751
About my assignment...

00:29:58.872 --> 00:30:00.392
Li, give me a second.

00:30:03.632 --> 00:30:04.912
Let me emphasize something.

00:30:05.311 --> 00:30:06.831
We'll leave at 4 AM tomorrow.

00:30:06.992 --> 00:30:08.712
So go to sleep, alright?

00:30:08.912 --> 00:30:09.912
- Okay.
- Okay.

00:30:10.152 --> 00:30:10.551
Yeah?

00:30:10.632 --> 00:30:11.152
Mr. Zheng,

00:30:11.152 --> 00:30:11.912
what should I do

00:30:11.952 --> 00:30:13.432
at the ceremony tomorrow?

00:30:13.551 --> 00:30:14.712
Take care of the leaders

00:30:14.952 --> 00:30:16.432
from the county tomorrow.

00:30:16.791 --> 00:30:17.232
Okay.

00:30:17.511 --> 00:30:18.472
One more thing.

00:30:18.872 --> 00:30:20.392
At the end of the ceremony,

00:30:20.551 --> 00:30:22.111
release the doves.

00:30:22.271 --> 00:30:22.992
Okay, no problem.

00:30:23.351 --> 00:30:25.912
Everyone seems so busy tonight...

00:30:26.311 --> 00:30:27.912
Forget it. You just came.

00:30:28.111 --> 00:30:30.192
It's a long journey. Just get some rest.

00:30:30.351 --> 00:30:30.952
Ms. Zheng.

00:30:31.071 --> 00:30:32.311
We need to check the accounts.

00:30:32.311 --> 00:30:33.392
Let's talk inside.

00:30:33.432 --> 00:30:33.831
Come on.

00:30:41.111 --> 00:30:43.271
16, 17, 18,

00:30:43.271 --> 00:30:44.152
- Meng.
- 19, 20...

00:30:44.591 --> 00:30:45.712
Meng, let me help you.

00:30:45.751 --> 00:30:46.472
No need, Ms. Li.

00:30:46.511 --> 00:30:47.271
I'm almost done.

00:30:47.591 --> 00:30:48.351
No need.

00:30:48.672 --> 00:30:49.511
Thank you.

00:30:53.311 --> 00:30:54.952
One, two, three.

00:30:55.472 --> 00:30:55.872
Yu.

00:30:56.712 --> 00:30:57.632
It's fine, Ms. Li.

00:30:57.712 --> 00:30:58.192
All set.

00:30:58.432 --> 00:30:59.031
Let's go.

00:31:10.632 --> 00:31:11.912
Mr. Xie, don't be shy.

00:31:12.111 --> 00:31:12.912
I can help you.

00:31:12.992 --> 00:31:13.591
Yeah.

00:31:13.672 --> 00:31:15.071
Look after the leaders.

00:31:15.111 --> 00:31:15.992
I got this.

00:31:17.472 --> 00:31:18.432
Be careful with it.

00:31:20.672 --> 00:31:21.111
Coming.

00:31:22.432 --> 00:31:22.872
Catch it.

00:31:23.992 --> 00:31:24.271
Okay.

00:31:26.751 --> 00:31:27.311
Excuse me.

00:31:27.311 --> 00:31:28.591
Yes, I called before.

00:31:28.632 --> 00:31:30.912
I'm Tan Guangming. Can't find it?

00:31:31.632 --> 00:31:33.952
Alright, please call this number
if you have any news.

00:31:34.712 --> 00:31:35.351
Okay, bye.

00:31:41.591 --> 00:31:42.672
You want to make a call?

00:31:43.831 --> 00:31:44.728
Business or private?

00:31:44.831 --> 00:31:45.311
Private.

00:31:46.551 --> 00:31:46.952
Come on.

00:31:48.432 --> 00:31:49.311
L-Listen.

00:31:49.392 --> 00:31:50.311
For personal calls,

00:31:50.432 --> 00:31:52.751
both making and receiving calls
are charged.

00:31:54.311 --> 00:31:56.271
How much per minute then?

00:31:56.672 --> 00:31:58.152
- Where are you calling?
- The provincial capital.

00:31:58.672 --> 00:31:59.952
Fifty cents per minute.

00:32:00.632 --> 00:32:01.511
Okay, no problem.

00:32:02.111 --> 00:32:02.591
Ms. Li.

00:32:03.632 --> 00:32:04.432
Once you're done,

00:32:04.472 --> 00:32:05.632
please write down

00:32:06.111 --> 00:32:08.111
where you called and how long you talked

00:32:08.192 --> 00:32:09.152
on that notebook.

00:32:09.351 --> 00:32:11.111
Then just put the money in the drawer.

00:32:11.912 --> 00:32:12.751
Okay, thanks.

00:32:23.472 --> 00:32:23.791
Hello?

00:32:24.271 --> 00:32:24.591
Hello?

00:32:24.952 --> 00:32:27.071
Qiuping? How was your first day?

00:32:27.311 --> 00:32:29.791
Did you impress everyone?

00:32:30.271 --> 00:32:31.271
I'm doing fine here.

00:32:32.031 --> 00:32:34.271
Everyone's been very welcoming.

00:32:35.152 --> 00:32:36.392
The ceremony is tomorrow.

00:32:36.672 --> 00:32:37.712
Wish me luck.

00:32:40.351 --> 00:32:41.192
I have to go.

00:32:41.791 --> 00:32:42.311
Love you.

00:32:43.031 --> 00:32:43.551
Bye.

00:32:43.992 --> 00:32:44.511
Love you too.

00:32:44.751 --> 00:32:45.192
Bye.

00:33:41.351 --> 00:33:42.872
Lin, I'm brushing my teeth.

00:33:43.232 --> 00:33:43.831
Just a second.

00:33:46.351 --> 00:33:47.712
We're not eating anything again.

00:33:48.511 --> 00:33:49.464
Why brush your teeth?

00:33:50.392 --> 00:33:51.351
It's my routine.

00:33:51.432 --> 00:33:53.351
- Mind your own business, okay?
- Okay.

00:34:00.591 --> 00:34:04.351
Are you pressured
because Ms. Li brought so many books?

00:34:05.632 --> 00:34:07.311
I'm busy during the day,

00:34:07.351 --> 00:34:08.151
but free at night.

00:34:08.191 --> 00:34:08.591
Good.

00:34:08.591 --> 00:34:09.631

00:34:13.591 --> 00:34:14.511
Impressive.

Done.

Here we go.

00:34:20.191 --> 00:34:21.711
It looks like a college dorm.

00:34:23.071 --> 00:34:24.912
She's here to stay for long.

00:34:26.792 --> 00:34:27.711
Nice flow.

it is incredibly lively.

The government
built a city out of this town.

Mom, I dreamed I found money.

00:35:31.352 --> 00:35:32.511

- Lots of money.

00:35:32.832 --> 00:35:34.472

Xuemei.

00:40:39.151 --> 00:40:40.511
You got so much land again?

00:40:41.111 --> 00:40:42.952
That one plot isn't enough for me.

00:40:43.191 --> 00:40:45.656
We have a home and a factory.
But workers still need dorms.

00:40:47.071 --> 00:40:47.511
You did

00:40:48.392 --> 00:40:49.111
the right thing.

Faster, please.

00:41:07.392 --> 00:41:08.151
