00:00:20.432 --> 00:00:24.260
=His Chosen Favor=

00:00:24.356 --> 00:00:27.204
(Regret
is the Most Beautiful Confession)

00:00:27.332 --> 00:00:27.926
=Episode 23= (Support Admin Watch on
kissasia.cam or kisskh.org)

00:00:27.926 --> 00:00:31.446
(Obsessing with refining
the elixir of immortality,)

00:00:31.446 --> 00:00:33.326
(Xiao Nandu gradually descended
into madness,)

00:00:33.326 --> 00:00:36.286
(not even sparing those closest to him.)

00:00:36.286 --> 00:00:37.006
(Now)

00:00:37.006 --> 00:00:39.486
(he extended his hands to Lu Zhen'er.)

00:00:41.726 --> 00:00:43.886
Traitor! How dare you betray me!

00:00:44.006 --> 00:00:45.486
I intended to spare you

00:00:45.486 --> 00:00:47.486
to reign eternally
as Empress alongside me.

00:00:47.886 --> 00:00:49.726
But you refused!

00:00:49.726 --> 00:00:51.646
I can no longer spare you.

00:00:52.446 --> 00:00:53.286
What are you doing?

00:00:54.326 --> 00:00:55.166
Rest assured.

00:00:55.846 --> 00:00:57.286
Your destiny is so good.

00:00:57.286 --> 00:00:59.166
We shall still be together,

00:00:59.646 --> 00:01:02.166
just in a different form.

00:01:08.166 --> 00:01:08.926
Your...

00:01:08.926 --> 00:01:09.846
Your hair!

00:01:17.686 --> 00:01:19.806
Guards! Bind her!

00:01:21.926 --> 00:01:22.926
Let go.

00:01:27.646 --> 00:01:29.686
You have the fate of a phoenix by birth,

00:01:29.686 --> 00:01:31.446
so claim you and claim the realm.

00:01:31.446 --> 00:01:34.966
If you had submitted willingly,

00:01:34.966 --> 00:01:37.126
I might have let you live.

00:01:37.126 --> 00:01:38.806
Yet again and again,

00:01:38.806 --> 00:01:40.486
you challenge my limits,

00:01:41.406 --> 00:01:45.006
so I must refine you into an elixir.

00:01:45.006 --> 00:01:46.526
This way,

00:01:46.526 --> 00:01:48.526
I'll forever possess you.

00:01:49.046 --> 00:01:51.446
(So this was the reason
for the bewitching consort's favor.)

00:01:51.726 --> 00:01:53.366
May your body

00:01:53.366 --> 00:01:55.646
yield a potent elixir,

00:01:55.646 --> 00:01:58.086
like your dear sister Yindan.

00:02:00.046 --> 00:02:00.766
What did you say?

00:02:00.766 --> 00:02:01.886
You forgot again?

00:02:03.086 --> 00:02:03.966
Zhen'er,

00:02:04.766 --> 00:02:06.926
you're always forgetful.

00:02:06.926 --> 00:02:08.206
Whimsical one moment,

00:02:08.206 --> 00:02:09.312
and unpredictable the next.

00:02:09.646 --> 00:02:11.326
You have changed suddenly,

00:02:11.326 --> 00:02:13.126
always like someone else.

00:02:13.966 --> 00:02:14.726
You

00:02:15.926 --> 00:02:17.326
killed Yindan?

00:02:17.326 --> 00:02:18.246
Yes.

00:02:18.686 --> 00:02:20.246
You also killed her parents?

00:02:20.606 --> 00:02:21.766
Yes.

00:02:21.766 --> 00:02:22.606
Why?

00:02:22.606 --> 00:02:25.046
Her father refined
the elixir of immortality for you.

00:02:25.046 --> 00:02:26.526
Why did you kill him?

00:02:26.886 --> 00:02:27.766
And what

00:02:29.086 --> 00:02:30.486
did Yindan do wrong?

00:02:30.726 --> 00:02:32.726
Excessive kindness is her fault.

00:02:33.326 --> 00:02:35.246
Whoever hinders my immortality

00:02:35.246 --> 00:02:36.446
must die.

00:02:37.966 --> 00:02:39.806
Yindan needn't have died,

00:02:40.046 --> 00:02:41.006
but she erred fatally

00:02:41.006 --> 00:02:43.526
by trying to expose my identity.

00:02:43.766 --> 00:02:45.686
How absurd!

00:02:46.086 --> 00:02:49.206
Still, elixirs refined
from such a pure soul

00:02:49.206 --> 00:02:50.886
possess a unique potency,

00:02:50.886 --> 00:02:52.646
distinct from those of others.

00:02:53.006 --> 00:02:54.086
Xiao Yicheng,

00:02:55.046 --> 00:02:56.166
you beast!

00:02:56.526 --> 00:02:57.806
You'll face retribution!

00:02:58.006 --> 00:02:59.526
Divine retribution awaits you!

00:02:59.526 --> 00:03:00.366
I've

00:03:01.206 --> 00:03:02.926
governed Beizhao diligently,

00:03:02.926 --> 00:03:05.526
saving millions from suffering.

00:03:05.526 --> 00:03:07.886
I merely seek immortality.

00:03:07.886 --> 00:03:09.206
So what?

00:03:09.206 --> 00:03:12.006
Using their bodies for elixirs

00:03:12.006 --> 00:03:13.326
is a small price.

00:03:13.326 --> 00:03:15.526
I can also refine them all,

00:03:15.526 --> 00:03:16.606
right?

00:03:16.846 --> 00:03:18.726
For your delusional immortality,

00:03:18.726 --> 00:03:20.366
you refine humans into elixirs.

00:03:20.366 --> 00:03:22.086
It's cannibalism!

00:03:22.086 --> 00:03:24.326
Elixir of immortality doesn't exist!

00:03:24.326 --> 00:03:25.846
It does!

00:03:26.326 --> 00:03:27.966
I'm on the verge of success!

00:03:29.006 --> 00:03:30.006
You're mad!

00:03:31.086 --> 00:03:31.966
Utterly mad!

00:03:34.966 --> 00:03:36.006
Zhen'er,

00:03:36.926 --> 00:03:39.086
once you understood me.

00:03:39.926 --> 00:03:41.206
Now,

00:03:42.486 --> 00:03:44.126
you disappoint me deeply.

00:03:44.726 --> 00:03:45.806
Enough.

00:03:46.126 --> 00:03:48.726
You adore my son Xiao Wenjing.

00:03:50.086 --> 00:03:51.366
Then I shall mercifully

00:03:51.366 --> 00:03:53.086
have him kill you.

00:03:54.446 --> 00:03:56.206
To die by his hand

00:03:56.846 --> 00:03:59.206
will be your delight.

00:04:00.086 --> 00:04:00.886
Wenjing!

00:04:13.446 --> 00:04:14.486
Xiao Wenjing!

00:04:16.966 --> 00:04:18.046
Kill her!

00:04:18.726 --> 00:04:19.726
Xiao Wenjing,

00:04:20.246 --> 00:04:21.806
I'm Lu Zhen'er!

00:04:24.246 --> 00:04:25.486
Xiao Wenjing,

00:04:26.166 --> 00:04:27.686
it's me, Lu Zhen'er! Xiao Wenjing!

00:04:31.166 --> 00:04:32.166
Xiao Wenjing,

00:04:34.126 --> 00:04:35.326
I'm Lu Zhen'er.

00:04:37.646 --> 00:04:39.006
Kill her.

00:04:42.446 --> 00:04:44.726
Look at me. I'm Lu Zhen'er.

00:05:04.926 --> 00:05:06.046
Xiao Wenjing.

00:05:07.366 --> 00:05:08.926
Your Majesty. Your Majesty.

00:05:08.926 --> 00:05:10.086
Let me go! Save Xiao Wenjing!

00:05:10.086 --> 00:05:10.566
Just go.

00:05:12.406 --> 00:05:13.966
Let me go!

00:05:15.046 --> 00:05:17.286
Nice to meet you.

00:05:22.606 --> 00:05:23.806
(Lu,)

00:05:23.806 --> 00:05:25.326
(in this final moment,)

00:05:25.326 --> 00:05:26.686
(I thought of you.)

00:05:28.766 --> 00:05:30.806
(Remember the first time
you said this to me.)

00:05:30.806 --> 00:05:34.806
Nice to meet you.

00:05:34.806 --> 00:05:36.966
(I never had that feeling before.)

00:05:38.326 --> 00:05:39.686
(I'm sorry.)

00:05:39.686 --> 00:05:41.806
(There are things I never told you.)

00:05:42.766 --> 00:05:43.806
So,

00:05:43.806 --> 00:05:45.766
that person in bed wasn't you, right?

00:05:45.766 --> 00:05:46.766
Of course not.

00:05:46.766 --> 00:05:49.246
(When I teased you
about your heart fluttering,)

00:05:49.646 --> 00:05:51.606
(you might have captured me.)

00:05:52.846 --> 00:05:53.766
Xiao Wenjing,

00:05:53.886 --> 00:05:55.406
you were the first one

00:05:55.406 --> 00:05:56.686
who will stand up for me.

00:05:57.926 --> 00:05:59.806
(You considered me your best friend,)

00:06:00.366 --> 00:06:02.846
(but I turned the pages of the comic,)

00:06:03.326 --> 00:06:05.024
(and spread an inescapable net for you,)

00:06:05.846 --> 00:06:07.726
(yet you bravely moved forward.)

00:06:07.726 --> 00:06:08.726
My fate

00:06:08.726 --> 00:06:10.326
is written by me.

00:06:11.486 --> 00:06:13.646
(When you pricked my fingers, I felt)

00:06:14.606 --> 00:06:16.606
(your unwavering trust in me.)

00:06:17.886 --> 00:06:19.126
You're good.

00:06:19.406 --> 00:06:21.206
I gave you everything you have now.

00:06:22.006 --> 00:06:23.686
I was a fool
to expect anything from you.

00:06:24.006 --> 00:06:26.686
(I sent you to the Laundry Service)

00:06:27.086 --> 00:06:28.646
(because I had hopelessly fallen)

00:06:28.646 --> 00:06:30.646
(for you, although you
killed me ten lifetimes.)

00:06:31.646 --> 00:06:32.486
Sister.

00:06:32.486 --> 00:06:34.006
(When Yindan died)

00:06:34.006 --> 00:06:35.766
(and you wept bitterly, I understood)

00:06:36.606 --> 00:06:37.486
(in this life,)

00:06:38.966 --> 00:06:40.326
(you have someone to protect,)

00:06:41.046 --> 00:06:42.646
(so do I.)

00:06:44.246 --> 00:06:45.766
(So this time,)

00:06:47.126 --> 00:06:48.966
(I do it willingly.)

00:06:52.526 --> 00:06:53.846
Let me go!

00:06:54.406 --> 00:06:55.726
Let me go!

00:06:56.006 --> 00:06:57.286
Your Majesty.

00:06:57.286 --> 00:06:58.686
Fu An, save Xiao Wenjing!

00:06:58.686 --> 00:07:00.126
Your Majesty, no need.

00:07:00.286 --> 00:07:01.246
Xiao Wenjing will die.

00:07:01.566 --> 00:07:03.686
He knew he would die.

00:07:06.566 --> 00:07:07.726
What did you say?

00:07:07.806 --> 00:07:08.966
Before deciding to wake you,

00:07:08.966 --> 00:07:10.686
he decided to die for you.

00:07:10.966 --> 00:07:12.846
His Majesty gave me the poison

00:07:12.846 --> 00:07:15.006
on the arrow he ordered me to shoot.

00:07:15.366 --> 00:07:17.486
His Majesty cannot survive.

00:07:28.526 --> 00:07:30.726
I don't believe it!

00:07:30.726 --> 00:07:31.296
Your Majesty.

00:07:32.046 --> 00:07:33.526
Xiao Wenjing!

00:07:35.126 --> 00:07:36.606
Xiao Wenjing!

00:07:47.326 --> 00:07:48.126
Your Majesty.

00:08:01.926 --> 00:08:03.206
Xiao Wenjing!

00:08:04.526 --> 00:08:05.326
Xiao Wenjing!

00:08:07.126 --> 00:08:08.086
I'll find Xiao Wenjing!

00:08:08.086 --> 00:08:08.646
Your Majesty,

00:08:09.566 --> 00:08:10.846
His Majesty has passed away.

00:08:11.966 --> 00:08:13.166
The Zichen Hall exploded.

00:08:13.646 --> 00:08:15.206
His Majesty and Xiao Yicheng

00:08:15.206 --> 00:08:16.446
were blown to pieces.

00:08:16.446 --> 00:08:18.966
Impossible! I don't believe it.

00:08:19.366 --> 00:08:22.006
His Majesty knew Xiao Yicheng
would refine him into elixirs,

00:08:22.206 --> 00:08:24.886
so he poisoned himself long ago.

00:08:25.046 --> 00:08:26.086
He knew this would happen.

00:08:26.686 --> 00:08:28.486
As long as he jumped
into the alchemy furnace,

00:08:28.486 --> 00:08:29.726
it would explode immediately.

00:08:30.046 --> 00:08:32.206
He was prepared long ago to perish

00:08:32.206 --> 00:08:33.966
together with Xiao Yicheng.

00:08:35.126 --> 00:08:37.566
I don't believe it.

00:08:37.566 --> 00:08:40.406
His Majesty instructed me,

00:08:40.406 --> 00:08:41.646
saying that

00:08:41.646 --> 00:08:43.206
he gave you an edict of succession.

00:08:44.166 --> 00:08:46.086
After he and Xiao Yicheng die,

00:08:46.086 --> 00:08:47.606
with the edict of succession,

00:08:47.606 --> 00:08:49.286
you can directly ascend to the throne.

00:08:49.606 --> 00:08:50.886
You will be Beizhao's

00:08:51.646 --> 00:08:52.846
first Empress Regnant.

00:08:54.926 --> 00:08:56.286
He had it all planned.

00:08:58.566 --> 00:08:59.926
He planned everything.

00:08:59.926 --> 00:09:00.686
Yes.

00:09:06.246 --> 00:09:06.966
Your Majesty.

00:09:10.606 --> 00:09:12.406
What else did he say?

00:09:12.806 --> 00:09:13.646
His Majesty said,

00:09:14.166 --> 00:09:15.566
he is willing to die

00:09:15.566 --> 00:09:17.366
for Your Majesty.

00:09:17.366 --> 00:09:18.606
Don't be sad.

00:09:19.526 --> 00:09:20.966
In the next life,

00:09:20.966 --> 00:09:22.766
he'll surely treat Your Majesty well.

00:09:32.606 --> 00:09:34.686
But in this life,

00:09:35.886 --> 00:09:38.206
I also want to be with Xiao Wenjing.

00:09:38.886 --> 00:09:39.766
My condolences.

00:09:45.408 --> 00:09:49.141
(A month ago)

00:09:52.086 --> 00:09:54.006
Tomorrow, I'll lose my memory.

00:09:54.006 --> 00:09:56.486
I might never remember who she is.

00:09:57.046 --> 00:09:58.166
With the tiger tally,

00:09:58.166 --> 00:09:59.246
protect her well.

00:10:00.046 --> 00:10:01.286
Don't let her get hurt.

00:10:02.006 --> 00:10:03.366
Even if I try to harm her,

00:10:03.366 --> 00:10:04.606
you must never allow it.

00:10:05.926 --> 00:10:10.246
When she becomes Empress Regnant,
assist her faithfully.

00:10:10.366 --> 00:10:12.006
She's fallen so far,

00:10:12.006 --> 00:10:13.806
why do you still treat her so well?

00:10:14.846 --> 00:10:15.926
That's not her.

00:10:15.926 --> 00:10:17.006
How could it not be her?

00:10:19.646 --> 00:10:21.326
You'll understand when she returns.

00:10:21.806 --> 00:10:23.286
Is it really worth

00:10:23.286 --> 00:10:24.486
treating her like this?

00:10:27.326 --> 00:10:28.126
She's worth it.

00:10:29.686 --> 00:10:30.846
After I die,

00:10:30.846 --> 00:10:32.544
have her mourn for me for three years.

00:10:34.086 --> 00:10:34.766
Never mind.

00:10:36.726 --> 00:10:37.486
One year.

00:10:38.206 --> 00:10:39.326
During this year,

00:10:40.886 --> 00:10:42.286
don't let her go to another man.

00:10:42.286 --> 00:10:43.566
She won't.

00:10:45.406 --> 00:10:47.726
If after a year,
she doesn't go to someone,

00:10:49.846 --> 00:10:51.246
help her find a few good ones.

00:10:52.006 --> 00:10:52.646
Your Majesty.

00:10:53.766 --> 00:10:55.606
In this life,

00:10:55.606 --> 00:10:57.086
one always needs companionship.

00:10:57.366 --> 00:10:58.486
With her temperament,

00:10:59.606 --> 00:11:01.166
prolonged loneliness will make her ill.

00:11:01.806 --> 00:11:03.246
Understood.

00:11:06.006 --> 00:11:06.766
Fu An,

00:11:09.646 --> 00:11:10.326
take care.

00:11:13.446 --> 00:11:16.126
I see Your Majesty off.

00:11:16.126 --> 00:11:19.206
I'll take my leave.

00:11:21.046 --> 00:11:22.166
(Lu Zhen'er,)

00:11:24.286 --> 00:11:25.526
