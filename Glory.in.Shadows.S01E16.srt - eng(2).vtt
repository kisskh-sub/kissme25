00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:14.400
Old Madam!

00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:15.760
Bad news!

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:18.590
Concubine Qin died suddenly.

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:20.920
Her Ladyship suspects
Concubine Tang of killing her.

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:22.120
In a fit of rage,

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:23.710
Her Ladyship beat Concubine Tang to death!

00:01:25.790 --> 00:01:27.200
Shen Yaochu!

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:29.760
She never gave me a moment's peace!

00:01:37.040 --> 00:01:37.880
Hurry, hurry.

00:01:41.150 --> 00:01:41.990
Stop right there!

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:45.680
Old Madam.

00:01:46.040 --> 00:01:47.120
What are you carrying?

00:01:48.760 --> 00:01:49.600
They are...

00:01:49.780 --> 00:01:50.640
They are...

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:51.480
Move.

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:16.310
Mother!

00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:18.280
Concubine Tang and Concubine Qin

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:19.640
are truly dead.

00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:21.150
What a nuisance!

00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:22.400
Out of the way!

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:23.520
Carry them away.

00:02:31.630 --> 00:02:32.710
Shen Yaochu,

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:35.430
Concubine Qin was no virtuous lady.

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:36.520
She deserved to die.

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:38.190
But what did Concubine Tang do

00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:39.430
for you to kill her?

00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:41.310
Concubine Tang

00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:44.470
killed Concubine Qin.

00:02:44.870 --> 00:02:45.800
She killed herself in fear.

00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:47.470
Is that so?

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:51.360
Her wound shows she was killed!

00:02:52.190 --> 00:02:53.030
Shen,

00:02:53.590 --> 00:02:55.030
you are vicious and jealous.

00:02:55.520 --> 00:02:56.590
Concubine Qin is dead.

00:02:56.750 --> 00:02:57.960
Must you kill Concubine Tang?

00:02:58.840 --> 00:03:00.190
If you don't believe me,

00:03:00.190 --> 00:03:01.590
I have no other recourse.

00:03:01.960 --> 00:03:02.800
Guards!

00:03:03.190 --> 00:03:04.630
Shen attempted murder.

00:03:05.030 --> 00:03:05.870
Seize her!

00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:07.680
Seize me?

00:03:10.960 --> 00:03:12.590
For the sake of your future grandson,

00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:14.200
Old Madam,

00:03:14.470 --> 00:03:16.030
you'd best stay out of this.

00:03:16.430 --> 00:03:17.270
You...

00:03:18.080 --> 00:03:19.870
How dare you threaten me with your child?

00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:21.120
That's right.

00:03:22.150 --> 00:03:23.150
If not for the child,

00:03:23.150 --> 00:03:24.710
how would I dare challenge you?

00:03:25.750 --> 00:03:26.800
How dare you!

00:03:27.470 --> 00:03:28.430
In my view,

00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:30.710
a dead concubine is just

00:03:30.870 --> 00:03:31.870
a dead concubine.

00:03:32.430 --> 00:03:34.190
As long as I give birth to
the legitimate son,

00:03:34.430 --> 00:03:35.590
what does it matter if a few

00:03:35.910 --> 00:03:36.750
more concubines die?

00:03:37.470 --> 00:03:38.310
Do you agree,

00:03:38.800 --> 00:03:39.640
Old Madam?

00:03:41.080 --> 00:03:42.470
I take my leave.

00:04:14.870 --> 00:04:15.840
I'm not dead?

00:04:16.800 --> 00:04:18.120
No, you're alive.

00:04:18.750 --> 00:04:20.070
That wound is also fake.

00:04:21.040 --> 00:04:23.240
We used a feigned-death drug
to get you out.

00:04:23.950 --> 00:04:25.750
This was supposed to be your grave.

00:04:32.290 --> 00:04:33.160
Your Ladyship,

00:04:33.160 --> 00:04:34.600
you believe that I didn't kill her?

00:04:34.870 --> 00:04:36.190
We never suspected you.

00:04:37.560 --> 00:04:38.400
But why...

00:04:39.190 --> 00:04:40.190
I don't understand at all?

00:04:40.480 --> 00:04:42.160
Someone colluded with Qin
to cause trouble.

00:04:42.390 --> 00:04:43.230
Today we set a trap

00:04:43.360 --> 00:04:44.800
to draw out the mastermind,

00:04:45.040 --> 00:04:46.560
but he shifted the blame onto you.

00:04:47.800 --> 00:04:49.480
Though you had conflicts with Qin Ruoyi,

00:04:50.360 --> 00:04:51.480
your heart is not evil.

00:04:51.950 --> 00:04:53.270
You would never commit murder.

00:04:53.750 --> 00:04:56.000
So, the murder must be someone else.

00:04:56.680 --> 00:04:57.630
So,

00:04:58.000 --> 00:04:59.560
you pretended to fall for it

00:04:59.800 --> 00:05:01.190
just to confuse the enemy

00:05:01.190 --> 00:05:02.680
and make him lower his guard, right?

00:05:05.480 --> 00:05:06.320
I see.

00:05:06.750 --> 00:05:08.680
Thank goodness you
thought of faking my death.

00:05:09.040 --> 00:05:10.950
Otherwise, I truly would
have died wrongfully.

00:05:11.800 --> 00:05:13.600
So, what should I do now?

00:05:14.600 --> 00:05:15.750
To mislead the mastermind,

00:05:16.040 --> 00:05:17.390
you need to remain dead for a while.

00:05:17.560 --> 00:05:18.680
Do not appear in public

00:05:18.920 --> 00:05:19.800
and alert the enemy.

00:05:20.070 --> 00:05:21.270
This is also out of your safety.

00:05:22.310 --> 00:05:23.150
Also...

00:05:25.510 --> 00:05:27.190
Do you remember my promise?

00:05:28.390 --> 00:05:29.600
To let you leave the Li Manor

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:31.680
and seek the wider world.

00:05:33.720 --> 00:05:34.560
Your Ladyship...

00:05:40.750 --> 00:05:41.800
Once this turmoil passes,

00:05:42.270 --> 00:05:43.920
General and I will
send you out of the city.

00:05:44.430 --> 00:05:46.000
Go wherever you wish,

00:05:46.270 --> 00:05:47.110
do whatever you wish,

00:05:47.680 --> 00:05:48.830
follow your own heart.

00:05:49.600 --> 00:05:50.440
But

00:05:50.800 --> 00:05:52.000
you cannot use

00:05:52.310 --> 00:05:53.390
the name of Tang Yuzhu.

00:05:55.750 --> 00:05:57.160
What does a name matter?

00:05:58.040 --> 00:05:59.430
If I stayed in the manor forever,

00:05:59.920 --> 00:06:01.430
people would call me Concubine Tang.

00:06:01.560 --> 00:06:02.830
Who would remember my name?

00:06:03.680 --> 00:06:05.190
Now that I have changed my fate,

00:06:05.600 --> 00:06:07.240
why not give myself a new name?

00:06:07.560 --> 00:06:08.600
Glad you think that way.

00:06:09.920 --> 00:06:11.510
For now, stay hidden.

00:06:11.800 --> 00:06:12.680
When it's over,

00:06:13.040 --> 00:06:14.120
we will come for you.

00:06:15.160 --> 00:06:16.000
Oh, right.

00:06:16.360 --> 00:06:17.750
I just remembered something.

00:06:17.920 --> 00:06:19.190
I don't know if it will help you.

00:06:19.630 --> 00:06:20.750
Before I lost consciousness,

00:06:21.160 --> 00:06:22.310
I smelled a certain fragrance.

00:06:25.800 --> 00:06:27.430
Are you here to make fun of me too?

00:06:28.270 --> 00:06:29.110
Of course.

00:06:29.750 --> 00:06:30.630
What's happened to you...

00:06:38.190 --> 00:06:39.270
That was a woman?

00:06:39.830 --> 00:06:41.160
She was slender,

00:06:41.560 --> 00:06:42.480
not built like a man.

00:06:43.070 --> 00:06:45.360
That woman in black sprinkled
some spices on me,

00:06:45.720 --> 00:06:47.040
and I passed out completely.

00:06:47.560 --> 00:06:49.240
When I came to, I remembered nothing.

00:06:49.240 --> 00:06:50.190
Only now do I recall

00:06:50.720 --> 00:06:52.600
her distinct fragrance,

00:06:52.830 --> 00:06:55.070
the scent of
Fragrant Concubine Treading on Snow.

00:07:00.600 --> 00:07:01.600
So far, those who died

00:07:02.160 --> 00:07:04.190
of Fan Scorpion Poison include my mother,

00:07:04.430 --> 00:07:06.040
Shopkeeper Liu, and Qin Ruoyi.

00:07:07.480 --> 00:07:09.680
These three seem to have no connection,

00:07:10.360 --> 00:07:11.360
but on closer thought,

00:07:12.070 --> 00:07:12.920
they're all tied to me.

00:07:15.040 --> 00:07:16.680
I once thought Qin Ruoyi poisoned them,

00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:19.190
but now she has died from the same poison.

00:07:19.950 --> 00:07:20.790
So, behind all this,

00:07:21.360 --> 00:07:22.510
there must be a hidden manipulator.

00:07:24.720 --> 00:07:25.560
General,

00:07:26.600 --> 00:07:27.870
do you remember what Qin Ruoyi

00:07:28.160 --> 00:07:29.480
said to Scholar Kong?

00:07:31.310 --> 00:07:32.240
She was right.

00:07:35.270 --> 00:07:36.830
My child must die.

00:07:38.070 --> 00:07:40.240
Could that woman mentioned by Qin Ruoyi

00:07:40.630 --> 00:07:42.950
be the woman in black Yuzhu spoke of?

00:07:44.360 --> 00:07:46.480
This person can move freely in Li Manor

00:07:46.750 --> 00:07:47.800
and bears you ill will.

00:07:48.600 --> 00:07:49.440
Who could it be?

00:07:52.480 --> 00:07:53.750
Could it be...

00:07:56.070 --> 00:07:56.920
Old Madam?

00:07:58.240 --> 00:07:59.360
Old Madam.

00:08:04.750 --> 00:08:06.510
General, I have urgent news.

00:08:07.720 --> 00:08:08.680
It's fine, go ahead.

00:08:09.430 --> 00:08:10.510
Recently, our men intercepted

00:08:10.510 --> 00:08:11.720
letters to and from Lord Qin.

00:08:12.070 --> 00:08:14.270
One letter in particular
requires your inspection.

00:08:15.310 --> 00:08:16.950
You act the general's wife well,

00:08:17.430 --> 00:08:18.600
avoiding military talk.

00:08:19.630 --> 00:08:20.950
If you have military duties,

00:08:21.120 --> 00:08:22.040
I will return home.

00:08:24.780 --> 00:08:28.060
(The plot to assassinate Li Jingchuan
may be exposed. Urgent cleanup is needed.)

00:08:32.240 --> 00:08:33.720
Take a look. It's not military matters.

00:08:43.080 --> 00:08:44.510
The one secretly corresponding

00:08:44.510 --> 00:08:45.600
with Lord Qin is Old Madam?

00:08:47.550 --> 00:08:48.790
So your assassination attempt

00:08:48.790 --> 00:08:50.080
was also Old Madam's doing.

00:08:51.320 --> 00:08:52.480
From now on,

00:08:53.120 --> 00:08:54.480
we share a common enemy.

00:08:57.510 --> 00:08:58.510
Do you have a plan?

00:08:59.510 --> 00:09:00.910
She is my mother in name.

00:09:01.440 --> 00:09:02.670
I still cannot act against her.

00:09:04.360 --> 00:09:05.510
In that case,

00:09:06.960 --> 00:09:07.800
let me handle it.

00:09:08.440 --> 00:09:09.280
What will you do?

00:09:10.480 --> 00:09:12.670
Qin Ruoyi and Tang Yuzhu dead today.

00:09:13.120 --> 00:09:14.240
Given Old Madam's temper,

00:09:14.390 --> 00:09:15.510
she will surely punish me.

00:09:16.910 --> 00:09:18.200
Then why don't we

00:09:20.440 --> 00:09:21.440
advance by retreating?

00:09:24.420 --> 00:09:26.100
(Li Manor)

00:09:27.510 --> 00:09:28.390
Shen,

00:09:29.080 --> 00:09:31.120
why did you kill Concubine Tang?

00:09:31.120 --> 00:09:32.630
(Stability Ensures Peace)

00:09:32.630 --> 00:09:33.470
Old Madam,

00:09:34.480 --> 00:09:35.670
I've made it clear.

00:09:36.120 --> 00:09:37.910
Concubine Tang killed herself in fear,

00:09:38.200 --> 00:09:39.080
none of my business.

00:09:39.960 --> 00:09:41.390
Do you take me for blind?

00:09:42.240 --> 00:09:44.000
Her wound shows she was killed!

00:09:44.910 --> 00:09:46.630
Anyway, you won't find her body.

00:09:47.510 --> 00:09:48.390
What did you say?

00:09:56.350 --> 00:09:57.240
Brother!

00:09:57.240 --> 00:09:58.080
Wan'er.

00:09:58.080 --> 00:09:58.960
Brother,

00:09:58.960 --> 00:09:59.810
Mother is questioning

00:09:59.810 --> 00:10:01.080
Sister-in-law over the deaths

00:10:01.080 --> 00:10:01.920
of the two concubines.

00:10:01.930 --> 00:10:02.790
I don't know why

00:10:02.790 --> 00:10:04.320
sister-in-law treated them so cruelly.

00:10:04.480 --> 00:10:05.390
You should go!

00:10:14.360 --> 00:10:15.200
Old Madam.

00:10:15.480 --> 00:10:16.320
General.

00:10:16.670 --> 00:10:17.630
Jingchuan,

00:10:17.630 --> 00:10:19.630
I know you favor Shen,

00:10:20.120 --> 00:10:21.510
but this concerns human life.

00:10:22.030 --> 00:10:23.320
This must not be taken lightly.

00:10:23.790 --> 00:10:24.910
Human life?

00:10:26.600 --> 00:10:27.630
Did you really kill her?

00:10:27.790 --> 00:10:28.630
I did not.

00:10:29.720 --> 00:10:31.550
After killing Concubine Qin,
Concubine Tang

00:10:31.550 --> 00:10:33.200
killed herself in fear, not me.

00:10:34.480 --> 00:10:36.670
Wan'er and I both saw it clearly.

00:10:37.120 --> 00:10:38.720
Concubine Tang was murdered.

00:10:39.870 --> 00:10:41.000
You, as the Primary Wife,

00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:42.270
are so vicious.

00:10:42.840 --> 00:10:44.750
Our household has
no place for the likes of you.

00:10:45.720 --> 00:10:46.670
What evidence do you have?

00:10:47.630 --> 00:10:48.790
You can't even find the body.

00:10:49.320 --> 00:10:50.320
How do you convict me?

00:10:50.960 --> 00:10:52.960
You had the body moved away.

00:10:53.440 --> 00:10:54.600
Of course I couldn't find it.

00:10:57.030 --> 00:10:57.870
Old Madam,

00:10:58.360 --> 00:10:59.840
I did not spend much time with Tang,

00:11:00.440 --> 00:11:01.390
but I know very well

00:11:01.390 --> 00:11:03.080
she didn't have the nerve to kill anyone.

00:11:04.840 --> 00:11:05.720
Shen Yaochu!

00:11:07.030 --> 00:11:08.840
I treated you well all this time,

00:11:08.840 --> 00:11:09.750
yet you commit murder!

00:11:10.240 --> 00:11:11.080
General,

00:11:12.670 --> 00:11:14.910
you once said you only love me.

00:11:16.750 --> 00:11:18.360
Concubine Tang is dead, so be it.

00:11:19.080 --> 00:11:20.840
Now no one will disturb us anymore.

00:11:21.200 --> 00:11:22.040
Ridiculous!

00:11:22.200 --> 00:11:23.150
What nonsense is that!

00:11:23.150 --> 00:11:24.480
(Stability Ensures Peace)

00:11:24.480 --> 00:11:26.030
No matter how jealous you act,

00:11:26.030 --> 00:11:26.870
I don't care.

00:11:27.750 --> 00:11:29.480
But you dared to kill an innocent person.

00:11:30.200 --> 00:11:31.630
Such cruelty makes you

00:11:31.630 --> 00:11:32.670
unfit to be my wife!

00:11:34.080 --> 00:11:35.550
What else can you do? Divorce me?

00:11:37.510 --> 00:11:38.750
Yes, I will divorce you.

00:11:42.670 --> 00:11:43.510
But...

00:11:44.240 --> 00:11:45.870
But I am carrying your child.

00:11:48.550 --> 00:11:49.390
If my child

00:11:49.390 --> 00:11:51.120
were to have such a vicious mother,

00:11:51.120 --> 00:11:52.750
I would rather not have this child!

00:11:55.000 --> 00:11:55.840
Pregnant?

00:11:57.600 --> 00:11:58.550
Shen,

00:11:59.750 --> 00:12:01.440
are you truly pregnant?

00:12:03.670 --> 00:12:06.510
You asked for an imperial physician
to take your pulse.

00:12:07.390 --> 00:12:09.600
Today, I'll summon an imperial physician

00:12:10.440 --> 00:12:13.080
and see what excuse you have left.
