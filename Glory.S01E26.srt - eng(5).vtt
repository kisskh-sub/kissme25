[Episode 26]

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:56.460
My Lord, I have failed you.

00:01:56.680 --> 00:01:58.479
I fell into Rong Shanbao's trap.

00:01:58.640 --> 00:01:59.590
My Lord, please rest assured.

00:01:59.590 --> 00:02:00.070
I will definitely

00:02:00.070 --> 00:02:00.970
deal with Yang Yitang.

00:02:00.970 --> 00:02:02.230
I absolutely will not allow him

00:02:02.230 --> 00:02:03.170
to stand in your way.

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:04.770
You have served me for years.

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:07.860
I've treated you well, haven't I?

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:08.520
Yes. (Support Admin Watch on
kissasia.cam or kisskh.org)

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:09.430
Yes.

00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:21.250
Do you understand what I'm saying?

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:26.710
I understand.

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:27.920
I understand.

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:29.140
I understand.

00:02:36.329 --> 00:02:38.000
[Linji Prefectural Office]

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:39.370
I was blinded

00:02:40.030 --> 00:02:41.070
by greed

00:02:42.290 --> 00:02:43.240
and took Yang Yitang's bribes

00:02:43.240 --> 00:02:44.700
behind Lord Jiang's back.

00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:48.060
It is well-known that Yang Yitang
holds deep resentment

00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:49.460
against the Rong family.

00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:51.829
The Rong family is wealthy enough
to rival a nation.

00:02:51.829 --> 00:02:53.400
I also wanted a share of that fortune.

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:54.400
Therefore, I secretly assisted him

00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:56.410
in seeking revenge
against the Rong family.

00:02:56.410 --> 00:02:58.220
Now that my crimes have been exposed,

00:02:58.220 --> 00:03:00.150
I have nothing to say in my defense.

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:01.740
So you are claiming

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:05.060
that Lord Jiang
was completely unaware of this?

00:03:06.410 --> 00:03:07.210
That's right.

00:03:08.060 --> 00:03:09.690
The bribes I accepted from Yang Yitang

00:03:09.690 --> 00:03:11.220
are hidden in my residence.

00:03:11.460 --> 00:03:13.090
You'll find them if you search my place.

00:03:13.090 --> 00:03:15.020
For an official to neglect his duty

00:03:15.570 --> 00:03:17.430
is to betray the Emperor's grace.

00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:19.630
I know my crimes deserve death,

00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:22.300
and I dare not implicate others.

00:03:22.940 --> 00:03:25.130
I only ask for

00:03:25.570 --> 00:03:27.170
some dignity after my death.

00:03:41.650 --> 00:03:42.850
You don't seem surprised

00:03:42.850 --> 00:03:44.310
by Zhang Zhong's suicide.

00:03:44.410 --> 00:03:46.370
Jiang Yiqian has served
as an official for 30 years.

00:03:46.370 --> 00:03:47.130
If he couldn't handle

00:03:47.130 --> 00:03:48.390
such a trivial matter,

00:03:48.570 --> 00:03:50.350
then his 30 years of service
would mean nothing.

00:03:50.350 --> 00:03:51.900
He understands
how the bureaucratic game works

00:03:51.900 --> 00:03:53.500
and how his superiors think.

00:03:54.130 --> 00:03:55.790
Even if he's under suspicion,

00:03:55.900 --> 00:03:58.100
that alone isn't enough to convict him.

00:03:58.440 --> 00:03:59.840
You allowed him to meddle

00:03:59.850 --> 00:04:00.980
in the Rong Mansion.

00:04:01.460 --> 00:04:03.060
Wasn't that all for nothing?

00:04:03.570 --> 00:04:04.780
I allowed his meddling

00:04:04.780 --> 00:04:06.240
because I had other plans.

00:04:06.300 --> 00:04:07.260
I also used him

00:04:07.570 --> 00:04:09.460
to purge the traitors
within the Rong family.

00:04:09.460 --> 00:04:10.710
Yang Yitang has confessed

00:04:10.710 --> 00:04:12.240
to conspiring with Yunshu.

00:04:12.460 --> 00:04:14.690
Since this matter concerns your family,

00:04:14.690 --> 00:04:16.060
do you wish to handle it yourself,

00:04:16.060 --> 00:04:18.350
or should I intervene and make the arrest?

00:04:18.350 --> 00:04:19.550
But I must remind you—

00:04:19.790 --> 00:04:21.720
the current manager of the Rong family

00:04:21.720 --> 00:04:22.400
is her.

00:04:23.300 --> 00:04:24.230
There is no rush.

00:04:24.690 --> 00:04:25.950
She'll invite me back.

00:04:27.450 --> 00:04:29.210
Now that Jiang Yiqian
has revealed his true nature,

00:04:29.210 --> 00:04:30.420
I'm afraid

00:04:30.420 --> 00:04:32.330
he’ll be even more ruthless
in seeking revenge.

00:04:32.330 --> 00:04:34.010
You must be extremely cautious.

00:04:34.010 --> 00:04:36.210
If things get out of hand, come find me.

00:04:36.770 --> 00:04:37.860
Right now, Jiang Yiqian probably

00:04:37.860 --> 00:04:39.920
wants you dead more than anyone else.

00:04:40.500 --> 00:04:42.100
I'm just collateral damage,

00:04:42.630 --> 00:04:44.630
caught in the fight between you two.

00:04:44.890 --> 00:04:46.420
Since I've implicated you,

00:04:46.690 --> 00:04:47.740
why not punish me

00:04:48.250 --> 00:04:50.310
by keeping me as your personal guard?

00:04:52.330 --> 00:04:53.100
Lord Lu,

00:04:54.020 --> 00:04:55.740
you should now turn your attention

00:04:55.740 --> 00:04:57.000
to the Wei family case.

00:04:58.659 --> 00:04:59.370
Although the truth

00:04:59.370 --> 00:05:01.290
of the Wei family case has come to light,

00:05:01.290 --> 00:05:02.770
there are still some inconsistencies.

00:05:02.770 --> 00:05:03.250
First,

00:05:03.940 --> 00:05:05.740
if Jiang Yiqian didn't take bribes,

00:05:05.740 --> 00:05:07.370
why would he help the Yang family

00:05:07.370 --> 00:05:09.300
frame Wei Kejian
for the murder of his wife?

00:05:09.300 --> 00:05:11.180
Second, who is

00:05:11.570 --> 00:05:12.370
still harassing

00:05:12.370 --> 00:05:14.340
Madam Yang even after she's become a nun?

00:05:14.340 --> 00:05:16.180
If you think about it,

00:05:16.180 --> 00:05:18.380
both matters lead back to Jiang Yiqian.

00:05:18.550 --> 00:05:21.410
Rest assured,
I'll surely get to the bottom of this.

00:05:21.420 --> 00:05:24.020
The fox's tail will be exposed
sooner or later.

00:05:28.560 --> 00:05:30.740
Thank you, Lord Luo,
for uncovering the truth

00:05:30.740 --> 00:05:31.940
and clearing my name.

00:05:33.180 --> 00:05:34.510
A toast to you, Lord Luo.

00:05:41.560 --> 00:05:42.240
Well,

00:05:42.260 --> 00:05:44.260
it was simply my duty as an official.

00:05:44.930 --> 00:05:47.510
You've been stationed
in Linji for decades, Lord Jiang.

00:05:47.510 --> 00:05:49.170
Your truly put a lot of effort.

00:05:49.890 --> 00:05:52.570
But you should stay humble and cautious

00:05:53.180 --> 00:05:54.440
to secure your future.

00:05:55.930 --> 00:05:57.690
Thank you for your advice, Lord Luo.

00:05:57.690 --> 00:05:59.690
I will surely keep it firmly in mind.

00:06:01.890 --> 00:06:04.710
With the Yang Yitang
and Zhang Zhong cases resolved,

00:06:04.710 --> 00:06:05.840
Lord Luo, this time,

00:06:06.060 --> 00:06:07.860
you've solved another case

00:06:08.180 --> 00:06:09.620
during the Empress Dowager's
birthday celebration.

00:06:09.620 --> 00:06:12.130
Truly, it's the most capable people
who do the most work.

00:06:12.130 --> 00:06:13.190
Speaking of which,

00:06:14.100 --> 00:06:16.710
the Rong family's
hundred-year-old Tea King Tree

00:06:16.710 --> 00:06:18.510
is truly a wonder of nature.

00:06:18.750 --> 00:06:20.550
It's absolutely breathtaking.

00:06:21.370 --> 00:06:22.250
But...

00:06:23.620 --> 00:06:24.300
What is it?

00:06:26.420 --> 00:06:27.330
Forgive me,

00:06:28.180 --> 00:06:31.250
but the Rong family has recently
suffered a series of misfortunes.

00:06:31.250 --> 00:06:32.710
You should keep a close eye

00:06:32.980 --> 00:06:35.330
over the birthday tribute, Lord Luo.

00:06:36.010 --> 00:06:37.770
You cleared my name,

00:06:37.960 --> 00:06:40.050
so my warning is out of goodwill.

00:06:40.750 --> 00:06:43.330
The Rong family has long
held grudge against me.

00:06:43.330 --> 00:06:45.240
I'm worried they may stir up trouble

00:06:45.240 --> 00:06:46.770
over the birthday tribute,

00:06:47.230 --> 00:06:49.060
since they're unhappy with your verdict.

00:06:49.060 --> 00:06:50.659
You could be charged

00:06:50.659 --> 00:06:52.120
with dereliction of duty.

00:06:52.400 --> 00:06:54.060
Linji is a complex territory.

00:06:54.500 --> 00:06:55.770
I'm sure you'd prefer

00:06:55.890 --> 00:06:57.350
to settle things quickly,

00:06:57.830 --> 00:06:59.960
before they become more complicated.

00:07:02.860 --> 00:07:05.740
That's a fair point.

00:07:08.330 --> 00:07:08.740
Come.

00:07:09.500 --> 00:07:10.300
A toast to you.

00:07:27.500 --> 00:07:28.660
How's your health?

00:07:42.260 --> 00:07:42.790
Here.

00:07:42.930 --> 00:07:44.460
The drowned victim is here.

00:07:55.890 --> 00:07:56.690
Take him away.

00:07:58.940 --> 00:08:01.070
Have a drink first to warm yourself up.

00:08:07.140 --> 00:08:10.270
Thank you, My Lord,
for giving me a second chance at life.

00:08:13.250 --> 00:08:13.910
Please sit.

00:08:16.450 --> 00:08:17.690
As you instructed,

00:08:18.060 --> 00:08:20.400
I've warned Lord Luo
about the birthday tribute.

00:08:20.400 --> 00:08:22.060
Do you really want to stay here

00:08:22.510 --> 00:08:24.170
and not return to the capital?

00:08:24.420 --> 00:08:25.370
But I've heard

00:08:25.580 --> 00:08:26.900
that you and Lady Rong Yunshu

00:08:26.900 --> 00:08:27.960
are still engaged.

00:08:28.850 --> 00:08:30.690
Once I settle this old grievance,

00:08:30.690 --> 00:08:31.950
I'll leave this place.

00:08:32.630 --> 00:08:34.210
I treated her with sincerity,

00:08:34.210 --> 00:08:36.240
yet she discarded me like a worn shoe.

00:08:36.240 --> 00:08:36.900
Therefore,

00:08:37.760 --> 00:08:39.419
I will no longer lower myself.

00:08:39.750 --> 00:08:41.210
I will make her understand

00:08:41.549 --> 00:08:43.000
that I am not someone

00:08:43.460 --> 00:08:45.140
she can toy with.

00:08:45.700 --> 00:08:46.220
Good.

00:08:47.350 --> 00:08:48.810
That's how a man should be.

00:08:49.610 --> 00:08:52.210
So, what's your next move?

00:08:53.200 --> 00:08:56.040
The daughters of the Rong family
appear united but are divided within.

00:08:56.040 --> 00:08:58.700
We can first observe
their internal conflicts.

00:08:59.520 --> 00:09:00.790
When the time is right,

00:09:01.450 --> 00:09:03.370
we'll cut off the foundation
of the Rong family.

00:09:03.370 --> 00:09:03.970
By then,

00:09:05.490 --> 00:09:06.780
if you wish to take over

00:09:06.780 --> 00:09:07.710
the Rong family,

00:09:07.970 --> 00:09:09.230
it will be effortless.

00:09:11.040 --> 00:09:13.840
Mr. Bai, you are truly
a man of exceptional talent.

00:09:14.040 --> 00:09:16.440
I believe that once you enter officialdom,

00:09:16.450 --> 00:09:18.450
you will certainly reach the peak.

00:09:21.570 --> 00:09:22.020
Come.

00:09:31.350 --> 00:09:32.820
I miss Father.

00:09:36.190 --> 00:09:36.910
Li.

00:09:38.170 --> 00:09:38.810
Look.

00:09:39.900 --> 00:09:41.560
Look at these vast tea fields.

00:09:41.940 --> 00:09:42.920
One day,

00:09:43.420 --> 00:09:45.220
you will have your share as well.

00:09:47.210 --> 00:09:48.340
You're a bad person.

00:09:48.970 --> 00:09:50.450
I don't want to play with you anymore.

00:09:50.450 --> 00:09:52.180
I want to find Father.

00:09:53.020 --> 00:09:54.210
Li! Li!

00:09:55.260 --> 00:09:56.090
Li, come back!

00:10:23.960 --> 00:10:24.430
Yun...

00:10:29.260 --> 00:10:29.920
Lady Yunxi.

00:10:30.850 --> 00:10:31.780
Why are you here?

00:10:32.610 --> 00:10:33.730
Didn’t I tell you

00:10:33.730 --> 00:10:35.930
not to come near the Rong Mansion again?

00:10:37.310 --> 00:10:38.910
I prepared some mulian tofu.

00:10:38.970 --> 00:10:41.250
I remember it's your favorite.

00:10:42.420 --> 00:10:43.020
And Li,

00:10:43.580 --> 00:10:44.700
she likes it too.

00:10:58.420 --> 00:11:00.220
The Rong Mansion lacks nothing.

00:11:00.470 --> 00:11:02.000
If you dare come here again,

00:11:02.100 --> 00:11:03.500
I'll have you thrown out.

00:11:05.380 --> 00:11:06.040
Lady Yunxi.

00:11:08.420 --> 00:11:10.780
How is Li doing?

00:11:12.660 --> 00:11:14.210
Does she still need

00:11:14.210 --> 00:11:15.330
to hold someone's ear

00:11:15.330 --> 00:11:16.860
before she can fall asleep?

00:11:17.260 --> 00:11:18.660
Has she been eating well?

00:11:19.340 --> 00:11:21.040
She used to have such a sweet tooth.

00:11:21.040 --> 00:11:22.690
Every time I tried to feed her,

00:11:22.690 --> 00:11:25.090
I had to chase her
all around the courtyard.

00:11:25.570 --> 00:11:26.770
Has she grown taller?

00:11:28.140 --> 00:11:28.800
Does she...

00:11:30.970 --> 00:11:31.850
miss me?

00:11:37.870 --> 00:11:38.530
Lady Yunxi.

00:11:40.930 --> 00:11:42.590
May I just see her for a moment?

00:11:43.180 --> 00:11:44.910
I won't say a single word to her.

00:11:45.180 --> 00:11:47.110
A glimpse from afar will be enough.

00:11:49.830 --> 00:11:50.830
I miss her so much.

00:12:01.430 --> 00:12:02.030
An Cha,

00:12:02.850 --> 00:12:04.090
when you allowed Rong Shanbao

00:12:04.090 --> 00:12:04.970
to take Li away,

00:12:05.800 --> 00:12:07.160
you gave up on Li,

00:12:07.730 --> 00:12:08.860
and you gave up on me.

00:12:09.610 --> 00:12:10.610
Grandmother has no patience

00:12:10.610 --> 00:12:12.270
for those who refuse to let go.

00:12:12.450 --> 00:12:14.560
If you truly care for Li's well-being,

00:12:14.560 --> 00:12:16.420
then stay out of her life forever.

00:12:17.350 --> 00:12:18.490
Don't give people a reason

00:12:18.490 --> 00:12:19.420
to laugh at her.

00:13:12.540 --> 00:13:13.140
Miss,

00:13:13.660 --> 00:13:15.110
The method of harvesting the Tea King Tree

00:13:15.110 --> 00:13:16.420
is a family secret,
known only to the Rong family heads

00:13:16.420 --> 00:13:18.020
and passed down
from generation to generation.

00:13:18.020 --> 00:13:19.180
In the past, Lady Shanbao

00:13:19.180 --> 00:13:20.730
was the only one who took care of it.

00:13:20.730 --> 00:13:22.590
The roasting method that follows

00:13:22.610 --> 00:13:24.010
is also known only to her.

00:13:24.940 --> 00:13:26.800
With the Old Madam now bedridden,

00:13:27.140 --> 00:13:28.610
I'm afraid she is indispensable

00:13:28.610 --> 00:13:30.070
to this imperial tribute.

00:13:31.690 --> 00:13:33.290
The heads of the Rong family.

00:13:33.780 --> 00:13:34.420
Very well.

00:13:35.210 --> 00:13:36.740
Then go and invite her back.

00:13:37.780 --> 00:13:39.580
Station guards at Chongxi Hall.

00:13:39.850 --> 00:13:41.570
For Grandmother's well-being,

00:13:41.570 --> 00:13:42.810
no one is allowed to visit her

00:13:42.810 --> 00:13:44.020
except me.

00:14:00.850 --> 00:14:02.110
If you're not careful,

00:14:02.420 --> 00:14:03.610
the final result will be

00:14:03.610 --> 00:14:04.940
the leaves falling off.

00:14:11.450 --> 00:14:12.710
How dare you come here?

00:14:14.520 --> 00:14:16.070
That outfit suits you well.

00:14:16.350 --> 00:14:16.780
You!

00:14:30.690 --> 00:14:31.490
Yesterday, Lord Luo

00:14:31.490 --> 00:14:33.450
sent people to ask about the tribute.

00:14:33.450 --> 00:14:34.780
Only Shanbao knows

00:14:34.780 --> 00:14:36.020
how to harvest the Tea King Tree,

00:14:36.020 --> 00:14:37.210
which is why I came

00:14:37.210 --> 00:14:38.340
to ask you to return.

00:14:40.610 --> 00:14:42.660
So you came to ask for help.

00:14:43.420 --> 00:14:44.940
Presenting a tribute
to the Empress Dowager

00:14:44.940 --> 00:14:47.330
concerns the future
of the entire Rong family.

00:14:47.330 --> 00:14:48.380
Previously,

00:14:48.690 --> 00:14:51.150
Grandmother expelled you
from the mansion,

00:14:51.310 --> 00:14:52.790
but she is now ill.

00:14:53.420 --> 00:14:54.680
So I'm making the decision in her stead

00:14:54.680 --> 00:14:55.900
to bring you back home.

00:14:55.900 --> 00:14:58.230
I hope you'll think of the bigger picture.

00:14:59.910 --> 00:15:02.020
Since Yunshu is willing to compromise,

00:15:02.020 --> 00:15:03.550
I shall graciously accept.

00:15:03.900 --> 00:15:04.900
I wonder, Yunshu—

00:15:05.490 --> 00:15:06.950
have you found Mr. Bai yet?

00:15:09.140 --> 00:15:11.070
You don't need to worry about that.

00:15:13.970 --> 00:15:16.030
I'll leave the tea plantation to you.

00:15:16.810 --> 00:15:17.660
Please take care

00:15:17.660 --> 00:15:18.740
of Yunyin and Wanwan.

00:15:18.740 --> 00:15:19.540
Rest assured.

00:15:20.630 --> 00:15:22.630
I don't need anyone to look after me.

00:15:22.850 --> 00:15:23.570
As for you,

00:15:24.300 --> 00:15:25.630
you must stay cautious.

00:15:26.030 --> 00:15:27.890
You've already been fooled once.

00:15:28.310 --> 00:15:29.470
Beware those

00:15:29.490 --> 00:15:31.890
who appear kind
but have a serpent's heart.

00:16:03.850 --> 00:16:05.380
All of the Wei family's seized assets

00:16:05.380 --> 00:16:06.510
have been returned.

00:16:06.730 --> 00:16:07.690
Now it's the Wei family members

00:16:07.690 --> 00:16:09.020
who are taking care of him.

00:16:09.020 --> 00:16:11.350
They've consulted
countless doctors lately,

00:16:11.350 --> 00:16:14.080
yet his mental condition
hasn't improved at all.

00:16:15.090 --> 00:16:16.220
Do you know Yang Yun?

00:16:18.300 --> 00:16:19.590
No matter what you ask, My Lord,

00:16:19.590 --> 00:16:21.650
I'm afraid he won't be able to answer.

00:16:31.360 --> 00:16:33.470
What did Jiang Yiqian do to you?

00:16:43.760 --> 00:16:46.020
Wei has been mentally unstable for years.

00:16:46.020 --> 00:16:46.820
As you can see,

00:16:47.300 --> 00:16:48.330
he doesn't respond

00:16:48.330 --> 00:16:49.610
to any external stimuli.

00:16:49.610 --> 00:16:50.380
But the moment he heard

00:16:50.380 --> 00:16:51.850
the name "Jiang Yiqian,"

00:16:53.170 --> 00:16:54.660
he showed a look of terror.

00:16:56.120 --> 00:16:57.040
I suspect

00:16:58.180 --> 00:17:00.260
there might be a deeper secret
in Wei's old case.

00:17:00.260 --> 00:17:02.300
I'll interview
Wei's family members right now

00:17:02.300 --> 00:17:03.900
to see if I can find any clues.

00:17:10.490 --> 00:17:12.690
Has Bai Yingsheng still not been found?

00:17:14.140 --> 00:17:14.770
Not yet.

00:17:15.319 --> 00:17:16.050
I've already instructed my men

00:17:16.050 --> 00:17:17.450
to continue searching downstream.

00:17:17.450 --> 00:17:18.390
As soon as I hear anything,

00:17:18.390 --> 00:17:20.650
I'll report to you immediately, My Lord.

00:17:21.819 --> 00:17:24.140
My Lord, I also heard

00:17:24.530 --> 00:17:27.660
that Lady Rong Shanbao
has returned to the Rong Mansion.

00:17:34.640 --> 00:17:36.370
During your absence, Shanbao,

00:17:36.940 --> 00:17:39.270
did I take proper care
of the Tea King Tree?

00:17:40.620 --> 00:17:41.080
Not bad.

00:17:42.000 --> 00:17:43.940
Grandmother is bedridden
with a serious illness.

00:17:43.940 --> 00:17:45.210
For this imperial tribute,

00:17:45.210 --> 00:17:47.210
we'll have to count on you, Shanbao.

00:17:47.940 --> 00:17:49.470
But rest assured, Shanbao.

00:17:49.940 --> 00:17:51.470
I'll stay right by your side

00:17:51.770 --> 00:17:53.770
until the tea roasting is finished.

00:17:53.770 --> 00:17:55.370
You want to learn the method?

00:17:55.960 --> 00:17:57.290
Have you forgotten that

00:17:57.770 --> 00:17:59.250
the tea-making method

00:17:59.250 --> 00:18:01.010
belongs exclusively
to the heads of the family,

00:18:01.010 --> 00:18:02.530
and cannot be shared with outsiders?

00:18:02.530 --> 00:18:03.140
Shanbao,

00:18:03.580 --> 00:18:05.510
I am now the Rong family's manager.

00:18:05.730 --> 00:18:07.330
Why can't you pass it on to me?

00:18:07.860 --> 00:18:09.010
Have you asked Grandmother about this?

00:18:09.010 --> 00:18:09.940
As I said,

00:18:10.450 --> 00:18:12.380
I am now the Rong family's manager.

00:18:13.080 --> 00:18:15.340
Why is that so hard for you to understand?

00:18:16.940 --> 00:18:17.800
What will you do

00:18:19.010 --> 00:18:19.730
if I refuse?

00:18:20.420 --> 00:18:21.010
Shanbao,

00:18:21.660 --> 00:18:23.820
the moment you stepped back
into the Rong Mansion,

00:18:23.820 --> 00:18:25.480
you lost your right to choose.

00:18:25.970 --> 00:18:27.730
If anything goes wrong with the tribute,

00:18:27.730 --> 00:18:29.390
you alone will bear the blame.

00:18:30.050 --> 00:18:31.450
After all, everyone saw

00:18:31.730 --> 00:18:33.790
that I personally welcomed you back.

00:18:39.150 --> 00:18:39.740
Shanbao,

00:18:40.180 --> 00:18:41.780
you should think carefully.

00:18:41.940 --> 00:18:42.620
Will you choose

00:18:42.620 --> 00:18:44.550
to teach me the tea-making methods

00:18:44.730 --> 00:18:46.290
or delay the tribute

00:18:46.420 --> 00:18:47.680
and be arrested for it?

00:18:50.340 --> 00:18:51.740
You're competing with me

00:18:52.100 --> 00:18:53.770
for control of the Rong family.

00:18:53.770 --> 00:18:55.180
If the family falls, we all fall.

00:18:55.180 --> 00:18:56.210
If the tribute is delayed,

00:18:56.210 --> 00:18:57.820
the entire Rong family will suffer.

00:18:57.820 --> 00:18:58.730
Even if you win,

00:18:59.210 --> 00:19:01.270
what benefits would you gain from it?

00:19:01.970 --> 00:19:04.300
The one who cares more
is the one who loses.

00:19:05.650 --> 00:19:07.420
Shanbao, I know

00:19:07.690 --> 00:19:09.890
you value the Rong family more than I do.

00:19:35.290 --> 00:19:35.970
Miss Shen.

00:19:36.860 --> 00:19:39.140
Lady Yunxi said Li is here.

00:19:39.770 --> 00:19:41.500
Please, Miss Shen, do me a favor

00:19:42.020 --> 00:19:43.370
and allow me to say a few words to her.

00:19:43.370 --> 00:19:44.500
I want this one.

00:19:44.940 --> 00:19:45.600
Here you go.

00:19:46.530 --> 00:19:47.940
She's playing over there.

00:19:47.940 --> 00:19:48.960
This one is pretty too.

00:19:48.960 --> 00:19:49.680
Wanwan.

00:19:53.010 --> 00:19:54.210
Xiangling.

00:19:55.020 --> 00:19:56.420
Father.

00:19:58.730 --> 00:19:59.930
Thank you, Miss Shen.

00:20:04.900 --> 00:20:05.730
Father.

00:20:05.730 --> 00:20:06.290
Li.

00:20:07.830 --> 00:20:08.460
Li.

00:20:15.610 --> 00:20:17.970
Li, I miss you so much.

00:20:18.500 --> 00:20:19.600
Do you miss me?

00:20:19.860 --> 00:20:20.450
Yes.

00:20:24.000 --> 00:20:25.530
Yunxi must have been blind.

00:20:25.690 --> 00:20:26.860
How could she fall

00:20:26.860 --> 00:20:28.140
for such a weak man?

00:20:28.400 --> 00:20:29.600
Keep your voice down!

00:20:32.140 --> 00:20:33.740
Let's pick a bit of this, too.

00:20:37.530 --> 00:20:38.210
Wanwan.

00:20:39.860 --> 00:20:41.320
Is the tea tree a toy to you?

00:20:41.620 --> 00:20:42.480
Don't touch it!

00:20:43.950 --> 00:20:44.360
No!

00:20:45.180 --> 00:20:46.110
Stop it, you two.

00:20:46.450 --> 00:20:48.140
Why are you arguing with a kid?

00:20:48.140 --> 00:20:48.740
Come here!

00:20:48.900 --> 00:20:49.730
Be careful.

00:20:50.940 --> 00:20:52.100
You can't catch me.

00:20:52.540 --> 00:20:54.140
Sit down and have some water.

00:20:56.290 --> 00:20:56.920
Li,

00:20:57.420 --> 00:20:59.020
I want to take you somewhere.

00:21:00.090 --> 00:21:00.690
Come here.

00:21:01.520 --> 00:21:02.100
Are you coming or not?

00:21:02.100 --> 00:21:02.690
No!

00:21:03.530 --> 00:21:04.330
Rong Yunyin.

00:21:05.180 --> 00:21:06.420
Don't go too far.

00:21:06.690 --> 00:21:07.900
You can't catch me!

00:21:07.900 --> 00:21:08.500
Come here.

00:21:09.420 --> 00:21:10.020
Come here!

00:21:25.580 --> 00:21:26.380
Lady Shanbao.

00:21:31.290 --> 00:21:32.050
Lady Shanbao.

00:21:32.050 --> 00:21:33.180
We're here on Lady Yunshu's orders

00:21:33.180 --> 00:21:34.780
to secure Hualin Courtyard.

00:21:39.660 --> 00:21:42.050
Lady Yunshu personally
welcomed Lady Shanbao back home.

00:21:42.050 --> 00:21:42.620
There is no justification

00:21:42.620 --> 00:21:44.620
for keeping her confined like this!

00:21:44.820 --> 00:21:47.150
Yunshu won't allow me to see Grandmother.

00:21:47.250 --> 00:21:48.310
Mr. Yan, do you know

00:21:48.660 --> 00:21:50.120
how Grandmother is doing?

00:21:51.400 --> 00:21:52.060
Lady Yunshu

00:21:52.070 --> 00:21:54.380
hasn't actually stopped me from visiting.

00:21:54.380 --> 00:21:54.940
Every two days or so,

00:21:54.940 --> 00:21:56.540
I pay a visit to Chongxi Hall.

00:21:56.860 --> 00:21:57.860
Old Madam Rong...

00:21:58.490 --> 00:22:00.490
she is still unable to get out of bed,

00:22:00.580 --> 00:22:01.140
but she's speaking

00:22:01.140 --> 00:22:02.400
much more clearly now.

00:22:03.300 --> 00:22:05.050
While you were away from the Rong Mansion,

00:22:05.050 --> 00:22:05.690
I made sure

00:22:05.690 --> 00:22:07.620
to take good care of Old Madam Rong.

00:22:08.830 --> 00:22:09.430
Thank you.

00:22:11.730 --> 00:22:12.530
Lady Shanbao.

00:22:17.140 --> 00:22:17.620
If...

00:22:19.900 --> 00:22:21.230
you ever need my help...

00:22:21.610 --> 00:22:22.370
No need.

00:22:38.630 --> 00:22:40.530
Xiu Qiong, you may leave now.

00:22:49.050 --> 00:22:50.180
You can come out now.

00:23:05.240 --> 00:23:07.500
How did you know I was here, Lady Shanbao?

00:23:07.730 --> 00:23:09.330
Sneaking into my courtyard—

00:23:09.380 --> 00:23:11.410
you've grown increasingly rude lately.

00:23:11.410 --> 00:23:13.160
I came to pay a formal visit,

00:23:13.770 --> 00:23:14.660
but your servant

00:23:14.660 --> 00:23:15.460
drove me away.

00:23:15.820 --> 00:23:18.010
The more I thought about it,
the more uneasy I felt.

00:23:18.010 --> 00:23:19.340
I was worried about you,

00:23:19.530 --> 00:23:20.530
so I slipped in.

00:23:21.820 --> 00:23:22.290
I intended to leave

00:23:22.290 --> 00:23:23.690
once I knew you were safe.

00:23:24.210 --> 00:23:25.540
But you caught me first.

00:23:27.860 --> 00:23:28.460
By the way,

00:23:29.290 --> 00:23:30.490
where is your

00:23:30.490 --> 00:23:31.350
Steward Cheng?

00:23:31.730 --> 00:23:33.150
Whenever he hears that I'm here,

00:23:33.150 --> 00:23:35.480
he's always the first one
to chase me away.

00:23:37.770 --> 00:23:38.450
These days,

00:23:39.530 --> 00:23:41.460
has Jiang Yiqian tried to harm you?

00:23:42.820 --> 00:23:44.220
You're worried about me?

00:23:45.140 --> 00:23:45.740
Xiu Qiong.

00:23:45.800 --> 00:23:46.310
Wait.

00:23:48.210 --> 00:23:50.250
Jiang Yiqian has been very quiet lately.

00:23:50.250 --> 00:23:51.410
I deliberately made a show

00:23:51.410 --> 00:23:52.560
of summoning the Wei family members,

00:23:52.560 --> 00:23:54.360
but he hasn't made a single move.

00:23:55.400 --> 00:23:57.830
There's something I need your help with.

00:24:01.900 --> 00:24:03.030
Why are you smiling?

00:24:08.860 --> 00:24:11.720
Because you're actually willing
to ask for my help.

00:24:13.340 --> 00:24:14.070
That's nice.

00:24:17.940 --> 00:24:20.600
You were eavesdropping
on my conversation with Mr. Yan.

00:24:20.600 --> 00:24:22.460
I overheard it unintentionally.

00:24:23.940 --> 00:24:24.860
You said

00:24:24.940 --> 00:24:26.870
you needed my help with something?

00:24:27.420 --> 00:24:28.380
I'd like to see

00:24:28.620 --> 00:24:30.580
the inventory list
of the Wei family's seized assets,

00:24:30.580 --> 00:24:31.670
and the list of items

00:24:31.670 --> 00:24:32.870
that were returned

00:24:33.220 --> 00:24:34.680
after the case was closed.

00:24:36.050 --> 00:24:36.650
All right.

00:24:36.970 --> 00:24:38.870
I'll go to the office
and retrieve them for you.

00:24:38.870 --> 00:24:39.940
But Yunshu

00:24:39.940 --> 00:24:41.050
has confined you to the Rong Mansion

00:24:41.050 --> 00:24:42.210
and won't allow you to see anyone.

00:24:42.210 --> 00:24:43.820
Since you won't let me
sneak into your courtyard,

00:24:43.820 --> 00:24:45.080
once I get the records,

00:24:45.100 --> 00:24:47.300
how am I supposed to deliver them to you?

00:24:47.860 --> 00:24:48.790
It won't be long.

00:24:53.620 --> 00:24:54.620
Reading a book?

00:24:57.380 --> 00:24:59.380
Dear, listen to this.

00:24:59.490 --> 00:25:00.820
Do you want to hold this?

00:25:01.010 --> 00:25:01.450
Yes.

00:25:01.770 --> 00:25:03.180
Good. I'll put it here.

00:25:04.900 --> 00:25:05.660
Is it fun?

00:25:06.180 --> 00:25:06.980
Yes, it's fun.

00:25:07.690 --> 00:25:08.290
You see,

00:25:09.380 --> 00:25:10.900
Lord Jiang is also very fond of children.

00:25:10.900 --> 00:25:12.100
Would you like to try this?

00:25:12.100 --> 00:25:12.940
You will be

00:25:13.530 --> 00:25:14.450
very safe here.

00:25:15.290 --> 00:25:16.690
No one can

00:25:16.900 --> 00:25:18.100
take Li away from you.

00:25:19.450 --> 00:25:20.510
Why did you help me?

00:25:21.290 --> 00:25:24.090
The women of the Rong family
are mostly heartless.

00:25:24.730 --> 00:25:26.530
Since we've both been betrayed,

00:25:26.530 --> 00:25:27.250
helping you

00:25:28.820 --> 00:25:30.880
is no different from helping myself.

00:25:33.140 --> 00:25:33.860
Lady Yunxi is not

00:25:33.860 --> 00:25:34.990
a heartless person.

00:25:36.450 --> 00:25:38.310
It's just that I acted on impulse.

00:25:38.340 --> 00:25:39.470
Only now do I realize

00:25:40.010 --> 00:25:41.340
that I can't let go of Li,

00:25:41.900 --> 00:25:43.630
and I can't let go of her either.

00:25:45.860 --> 00:25:47.390
Eat slowly, take your time.

00:25:53.860 --> 00:25:55.860
An Cha is
Li's biological father, after all.

00:25:55.860 --> 00:25:57.660
He seemed so gentle and harmless,

00:25:57.660 --> 00:25:59.490
and he claimed
that you were the one who sent him,

00:25:59.490 --> 00:26:00.820
so I let down my guard.

00:26:01.210 --> 00:26:02.620
I was busy stopping a fight,

00:26:02.620 --> 00:26:04.660
and when I turned back, he was gone.

00:26:05.970 --> 00:26:07.580
He has certainly grown bolder.

00:26:07.580 --> 00:26:09.910
He even learned how to deceive people now.

00:26:09.940 --> 00:26:11.670
It seems I underestimated him.

00:26:11.940 --> 00:26:12.870
In your opinion,

00:26:13.010 --> 00:26:14.010
now that Li has been taken,

00:26:14.010 --> 00:26:15.140
where would they go?

00:26:15.290 --> 00:26:16.100
Do we need to send people

00:26:16.100 --> 00:26:17.490
to search for her in the city?

00:26:17.490 --> 00:26:18.690
He won't leave Linji.

00:26:19.140 --> 00:26:20.290
You don't need to worry about it.

00:26:20.290 --> 00:26:21.550
I'll find them myself.

00:26:23.940 --> 00:26:25.340
After Shanbao returned,

00:26:25.380 --> 00:26:26.640
-did she say...
-Miss.

00:26:31.490 --> 00:26:32.050
Miss.

00:26:32.380 --> 00:26:33.710
Here's a letter for you.

00:26:43.090 --> 00:26:43.890
What's wrong?

00:26:47.730 --> 00:26:49.260
It's just a private matter.

00:26:49.380 --> 00:26:50.640
I'll take my leave now.

00:27:03.180 --> 00:27:03.690
What?

00:27:04.860 --> 00:27:06.970
Is Shanbao still refusing to make the tea?

00:27:06.970 --> 00:27:07.930
That's not the issue.

00:27:07.930 --> 00:27:09.260
A servant just reported

00:27:09.730 --> 00:27:11.940
that Lady Yunxi went
to check the Tea King Tree

00:27:11.940 --> 00:27:13.600
and then left with the guards.

00:27:13.970 --> 00:27:14.900
What is she up to?

00:27:15.450 --> 00:27:16.700
I'm not sure, Miss.

00:27:17.340 --> 00:27:18.820
I only heard Lady Yunxi mentioned

00:27:18.820 --> 00:27:20.660
that a wall in her courtyard collapsed,

00:27:20.660 --> 00:27:22.330
so she took the nearby guards

00:27:22.690 --> 00:27:24.100
to clean up the debris.

00:27:25.580 --> 00:27:26.530
Fetch my clothes.

00:27:26.530 --> 00:27:27.770
I must see this for myself.

00:27:27.770 --> 00:27:28.370
Yes, Miss.

00:27:41.140 --> 00:27:42.250
Quickly!
Find people to extinguish the fire!

00:27:42.250 --> 00:27:43.900
Help! Somebody help! Hurry!

00:27:46.010 --> 00:27:46.470
This...

00:27:47.100 --> 00:27:47.760
Come! Come!

00:27:47.940 --> 00:27:49.050
Hurry! Hurry! Come on!

00:27:49.050 --> 00:27:49.450
Hurry.

00:27:50.010 --> 00:27:50.690
Hurry up!

00:27:50.970 --> 00:27:51.730
Put out the fire! Come on!

00:27:51.730 --> 00:27:52.490
We need more people!

00:27:52.490 --> 00:27:53.550
Quickly! Quickly!

00:27:53.690 --> 00:27:54.210
Hurry!

00:27:54.580 --> 00:27:56.690
-Water! Get the water!
-Put out the fire!

00:27:56.690 --> 00:27:57.180
Coming!

00:27:58.490 --> 00:27:59.020
Hurry up!

00:27:59.290 --> 00:27:59.820
Hurry up.

00:28:00.180 --> 00:28:01.180
Come on, quickly!

00:28:01.690 --> 00:28:03.290
Get some water from the well!

00:28:05.250 --> 00:28:06.420
Bring the water here!

00:28:06.420 --> 00:28:06.940
Coming!

00:28:07.690 --> 00:28:08.620
It's not enough!

00:28:09.180 --> 00:28:10.180
Get another bucket of water!

00:28:10.180 --> 00:28:10.970
Carry the water!

00:28:10.970 --> 00:28:11.970
-Hurry up!
-Coming!

00:28:11.970 --> 00:28:13.100
-Coming!
-Hurry up.

00:28:13.530 --> 00:28:14.730
-Coming!
-Hurry!

00:28:14.940 --> 00:28:15.400
Come on.

00:28:16.580 --> 00:28:17.110
Quickly!

00:28:17.530 --> 00:28:17.990
Coming!

00:28:19.420 --> 00:28:20.290
Get the water!

00:28:28.050 --> 00:28:28.580
Mr. Yan.

00:28:31.870 --> 00:28:32.380
Mr. Yan.

00:28:35.680 --> 00:28:36.540
There's a fire.

00:28:58.860 --> 00:28:59.740
Did you do this?

00:29:02.380 --> 00:29:03.790
What nonsense are you talking about?

00:29:03.790 --> 00:29:05.390
I had nothing to do with this!

00:29:07.010 --> 00:29:08.860
My courtyard wall collapsed for no reason,

00:29:08.860 --> 00:29:10.860
so I sent Cuiwei to seek assistance.

00:29:11.050 --> 00:29:12.180
After they arrived,

00:29:12.340 --> 00:29:12.820
Cuiwei and I

00:29:12.820 --> 00:29:14.420
watched them the whole time.

00:29:14.420 --> 00:29:16.550
It only took about 10 minutes in total.

00:29:16.580 --> 00:29:17.140
Yunshu,

00:29:17.970 --> 00:29:19.900
you are manager of the mansion now.

00:29:20.340 --> 00:29:21.180
Even if you want

00:29:21.180 --> 00:29:22.770
to evade responsibility
for your poor management,

00:29:22.770 --> 00:29:24.490
you should not slander me like that!

00:29:24.490 --> 00:29:25.380
If you hadn't

00:29:25.380 --> 00:29:26.640
moved the guards away,

00:29:27.010 --> 00:29:29.180
the Tea King Tree
would never have been ruined!

00:29:29.180 --> 00:29:30.820
When Shanbao was in charge,

00:29:31.420 --> 00:29:32.820
the Tea King Tree was never in danger,

00:29:32.820 --> 00:29:34.420
even without a single guard!

00:29:34.490 --> 00:29:37.080
Ultimately, this is a result
of your own incompetence.

00:29:37.080 --> 00:29:37.470
You!

00:29:41.630 --> 00:29:42.890
Are you satisfied now?

00:29:43.620 --> 00:29:44.580
Didn't you refuse to teach me

00:29:44.580 --> 00:29:45.690
the tea-making methods?

00:29:45.690 --> 00:29:46.620
Does this incident

00:29:46.620 --> 00:29:48.220
have anything to do with you?

00:29:56.380 --> 00:29:56.770
You!

00:29:57.250 --> 00:29:58.140
That slap

00:29:59.050 --> 00:30:00.450
was for your failure

00:30:00.940 --> 00:30:02.430
to prioritize what truly matters.

00:30:02.430 --> 00:30:05.030
In times of crisis,
you only think of yourself.

00:30:05.050 --> 00:30:06.920
You are so obsessed with our rivalry

00:30:06.920 --> 00:30:07.860
that you ignore

00:30:07.860 --> 00:30:08.820
the pack of hungry wolves outside

00:30:08.820 --> 00:30:10.490
waiting to devour the Rong family.

00:30:10.490 --> 00:30:11.900
The Tea King Tree is ruined,

00:30:11.900 --> 00:30:14.250
threatening the century-old foundation
of the Rong family.

00:30:14.250 --> 00:30:15.450
Now that disaster has struck,

00:30:15.450 --> 00:30:17.170
you don't think about how to fix it

00:30:17.170 --> 00:30:19.130
or investigate the security breach,

00:30:19.130 --> 00:30:21.660
yet you have the nerve
to vent your anger on me.

00:30:22.660 --> 00:30:23.450
All of this happened

00:30:23.450 --> 00:30:24.690
because Rong Yunxi

00:30:24.820 --> 00:30:26.140
moved the guards away.

00:30:26.290 --> 00:30:27.290
Why didn't you slap her instead?

00:30:27.290 --> 00:30:29.380
Your poor management was the root of it.

00:30:29.380 --> 00:30:31.530
There is a traitor
lurking in this mansion,

00:30:31.530 --> 00:30:32.930
yet you noticed nothing.

00:30:35.690 --> 00:30:37.290
You don't need to lecture me.

00:30:37.770 --> 00:30:39.700
You're living in the Rong Mansion.

00:30:39.700 --> 00:30:41.290
Now that the Tea King Tree
has been destroyed,

00:30:41.290 --> 00:30:42.900
and you are also responsible for it!

00:30:42.900 --> 00:30:43.770
Instead of standing here,

00:30:43.770 --> 00:30:45.630
calculating who is more to blame,

00:30:46.110 --> 00:30:46.940
you'd better start thinking

00:30:46.940 --> 00:30:49.070
about how to deal with what comes next.

00:30:49.360 --> 00:30:51.000
The imperial tribute is now destroyed;

00:30:51.000 --> 00:30:52.860
this is a matter of life and death.

00:30:55.660 --> 00:30:57.460
Grandmother is now severely ill

00:30:57.860 --> 00:30:59.490
and cannot handle any further bad news.

00:30:59.490 --> 00:31:01.150
If this reaches Chongxi Hall,

00:31:01.370 --> 00:31:02.700
you'll all be punished.

00:31:21.290 --> 00:31:23.290
If you want your daughter to be safe,

00:31:23.380 --> 00:31:24.140
at 7 PM,

00:31:24.580 --> 00:31:26.980
move the guards away
from the Tea King Tree.

00:31:29.940 --> 00:31:32.340
I thought he had finally
come to his senses.

00:31:32.480 --> 00:31:34.410
It turns out he was used once again,

00:31:34.620 --> 00:31:36.220
and dragged me down with him.

00:31:36.680 --> 00:31:39.210
What happened today
must not leave this room.

00:31:39.410 --> 00:31:40.410
Yes, Miss.

00:31:50.300 --> 00:31:52.630
The Empress Dowager's birthday tribute—

00:31:53.290 --> 00:31:55.690
how dare you treat it
with such negligence?

00:31:56.140 --> 00:31:58.210
Do you have any idea
what penalty you'll face?

00:31:58.210 --> 00:31:59.970
There was a traitor in the mansion.

00:31:59.970 --> 00:32:01.230
Rest assured, My Lord.

00:32:01.240 --> 00:32:02.240
I will investigate it thoroughly

00:32:02.240 --> 00:32:03.840
and give you an explanation.

00:32:03.860 --> 00:32:05.290
I don't care about that traitor.

00:32:05.290 --> 00:32:06.350
I want the tribute!

00:32:06.970 --> 00:32:08.280
The Tea King Tree has been destroyed,

00:32:08.280 --> 00:32:09.630
thereby offending the Empress Dowager.

00:32:09.630 --> 00:32:10.210
How many lives will the Rong family pay

00:32:10.210 --> 00:32:11.580
to atone for this?

00:32:11.900 --> 00:32:13.100
Rest assured, My Lord.

00:32:13.100 --> 00:32:14.290
The Rong Mansion has other

00:32:14.290 --> 00:32:15.620
century-old tea cakes.

00:32:16.100 --> 00:32:16.820
They're surely

00:32:16.820 --> 00:32:19.220
no inferior
to the Tea King Tree's harvest.

00:32:22.380 --> 00:32:23.640
Do you not understand?

00:32:24.380 --> 00:32:25.580
Her Majesty specifically requested

00:32:25.580 --> 00:32:27.440
tea leaves from the Tea King Tree.

00:32:27.460 --> 00:32:28.620
Her Majesty values

00:32:28.620 --> 00:32:30.330
the Tea King Tree's centuries-long history

00:32:30.330 --> 00:32:31.860
and its enduring blessing.

00:32:32.380 --> 00:32:32.900
How could

00:32:32.900 --> 00:32:34.830
any other tea possibly replace it?

00:32:35.630 --> 00:32:38.530
The Rong family has grown arrogant
under royal favor.

00:32:38.530 --> 00:32:39.660
You even treat
the Empress Dowager's birthday

00:32:39.660 --> 00:32:40.530
with contempt.

00:32:41.420 --> 00:32:43.290
You failed to deliver the tribute,

00:32:43.290 --> 00:32:45.350
yet you're trying to get away with it.

00:32:47.050 --> 00:32:47.530
Guards!

00:32:48.100 --> 00:32:48.730
-Yes.
-Yes.

00:32:48.730 --> 00:32:50.410
Take every member of the Rong family

00:32:50.410 --> 00:32:52.650
to the County Office for questioning.

00:32:53.100 --> 00:32:53.830
Yes, My Lord!

00:32:54.970 --> 00:32:55.530
Wait.

00:33:14.860 --> 00:33:15.920
Lady Rong Shanbao.

00:33:16.300 --> 00:33:18.960
The Rong family's Jade Seal
is an imperial gift,

00:33:19.250 --> 00:33:20.290
not a Death Exemption Token

00:33:20.290 --> 00:33:22.090
to protect you from your crimes.

00:33:22.230 --> 00:33:23.660
By flaunting it again and again,

00:33:23.660 --> 00:33:25.210
are you trying to use royal favor

00:33:25.210 --> 00:33:27.580
to stand above the law in Linji?

00:33:28.050 --> 00:33:29.710
Lord Luo, you misunderstand.

00:33:30.180 --> 00:33:31.040
This Jade Seal—

00:33:31.680 --> 00:33:34.080
I want to entrust it to you
for safekeeping.

00:33:34.620 --> 00:33:35.950
What do you mean by that?

00:33:36.530 --> 00:33:37.770
The fact that the Tea King Tree got burned

00:33:37.770 --> 00:33:39.230
was due to our negligence.

00:33:39.530 --> 00:33:42.060
This Jade Seal is
the Rong family's heirloom.

00:33:42.520 --> 00:33:44.320
I'd like to use it as a guarantee.

00:33:44.380 --> 00:33:45.380
Within five days,

00:33:45.670 --> 00:33:46.290
I will surely find a tribute

00:33:46.290 --> 00:33:48.150
worthy of the Tea King Tree's tea.

00:33:53.850 --> 00:33:56.840
There's still time
before the Empress Dowager's birthday.

00:33:56.840 --> 00:33:58.900
Why not wait five more days, Lord Luo?

00:34:00.200 --> 00:34:01.400
I believe Her Majesty

00:34:01.580 --> 00:34:03.210
would rather see the tribute presented

00:34:03.210 --> 00:34:04.670
than see people punished.

00:34:06.180 --> 00:34:09.340
Lord Lu, you are the magistrate of Linji.

00:34:10.210 --> 00:34:12.489
You shouldn't get too close to merchants,

00:34:12.489 --> 00:34:14.620
or you may invite unnecessary gossip.

00:34:14.690 --> 00:34:16.260
Lord Luo, you misunderstand.

00:34:16.260 --> 00:34:16.780
Today,

00:34:17.449 --> 00:34:18.050
I'm not here

00:34:18.050 --> 00:34:19.510
in my capacity as Prefect.

00:34:21.300 --> 00:34:22.900
Then what is your role?

00:34:23.750 --> 00:34:25.679
As an admirer of Lady Rong Shanbao.

00:34:32.389 --> 00:34:33.120
Lord Luo.

00:34:38.030 --> 00:34:39.030
What do you think?

00:34:49.730 --> 00:34:52.130
I'll take this Jade Seal.

00:34:53.340 --> 00:34:54.670
I hope Lady Rong Shanbao

00:34:55.130 --> 00:34:56.530
will not disappoint me.

00:34:58.170 --> 00:34:59.100
You have my word.

00:35:08.900 --> 00:35:11.210
What kind of birthday tribute
are you going to prepare?

00:35:11.210 --> 00:35:12.810
That is none of your concern.

00:35:13.380 --> 00:35:14.650
For the time being,

00:35:15.460 --> 00:35:16.740
you should stay in the mansion

00:35:16.740 --> 00:35:18.670
and reflect upon what you've done.

00:35:27.860 --> 00:35:29.260
What kind of birthday tribute do you think

00:35:29.260 --> 00:35:31.320
Rong Shanbao will offer Her Majesty?

00:35:33.050 --> 00:35:34.850
No matter what she comes up with,

00:35:35.130 --> 00:35:37.340
the Rong family's Tea King Tree
has already been destroyed.

00:35:37.340 --> 00:35:38.300
After this,

00:35:39.610 --> 00:35:41.650
the Rong family will be severely weakened

00:35:41.650 --> 00:35:42.980
and will never recover.

00:35:43.180 --> 00:35:44.240
That's not enough.

00:35:45.170 --> 00:35:46.430
We have to take her life

00:35:47.050 --> 00:35:48.450
while she's vulnerable.

00:35:55.970 --> 00:35:57.230
Rest assured, My Lord.

00:35:57.740 --> 00:36:00.010
I already have people watch Rong Shanbao.

00:36:00.010 --> 00:36:00.970
No matter what kind of birthday tribute

00:36:00.970 --> 00:36:02.370
she's planning to offer,

00:36:03.050 --> 00:36:04.380
I won't let her succeed.

00:36:08.770 --> 00:36:12.370
No wonder they say, "One should
never underestimate a scholar."

00:36:12.490 --> 00:36:13.220
You truly are

00:36:13.380 --> 00:36:15.170
a lucky star sent by God.

00:36:17.300 --> 00:36:18.820
Thank you for your kind words, My Lord.

00:36:18.820 --> 00:36:21.420
Actually, I have a favor to ask.

00:36:21.970 --> 00:36:22.610
What is it?

00:36:24.450 --> 00:36:26.220
Now that the Rong family
is under house arrest,

00:36:26.220 --> 00:36:28.820
I'd like you to give me control
over the guards.

00:36:30.450 --> 00:36:33.660
Are you concerned
that Lady Rong Yunshu may be mistreated?

00:36:33.660 --> 00:36:34.090
No.

00:36:35.610 --> 00:36:37.380
She used to trample upon me.

00:36:37.940 --> 00:36:38.490
Now,

00:36:39.650 --> 00:36:40.450
I want her

00:36:40.450 --> 00:36:42.310
to get a taste of her own medicine.

00:36:44.420 --> 00:36:46.020
You've done a great service.

00:36:46.110 --> 00:36:47.640
This is a small thing to ask.

00:36:47.900 --> 00:36:49.160
Just consider it done.

00:37:01.260 --> 00:37:02.060
Lady Shanbao.

00:37:05.530 --> 00:37:06.330
Lady Shanbao.

00:37:06.930 --> 00:37:07.860
Are you leaving?

00:37:08.300 --> 00:37:09.530
The Rong family is in trouble.

00:37:09.530 --> 00:37:10.860
You're not a member of the Rong family.

00:37:10.860 --> 00:37:12.790
You may pack your things and leave.

00:37:12.950 --> 00:37:15.280
Are you going to look for another tribute?

00:37:16.010 --> 00:37:17.260
I'm just buying time.

00:37:17.970 --> 00:37:18.900
I have to find a way

00:37:18.900 --> 00:37:20.230
to save the Rong family.

00:37:20.550 --> 00:37:21.220
Is there anything

00:37:21.220 --> 00:37:22.080
I can do to help?

00:37:23.380 --> 00:37:25.260
All my past suitors sought marriage

00:37:25.260 --> 00:37:27.320
only because my name is Rong Shanbao.

00:37:27.420 --> 00:37:28.820
If the Rong family falls,

00:37:29.340 --> 00:37:31.600
would you still stay at the Rong Mansion?

00:37:33.850 --> 00:37:35.810
I see. I have my answer.

00:37:52.110 --> 00:37:53.570
What did you two talk about?

00:37:53.570 --> 00:37:55.100
It's none of your business.

00:38:24.320 --> 00:38:26.550
It... it's you.

00:38:29.060 --> 00:38:30.990
I thought the first thing you'd say

00:38:31.110 --> 00:38:32.050
when we met again

00:38:32.050 --> 00:38:34.110
would be whether I am human or a ghost.

00:38:35.220 --> 00:38:37.250
You were the one
who burned the Tea King Tree?

00:38:37.250 --> 00:38:38.470
Shouldn't you be asking me

00:38:38.470 --> 00:38:39.700
how I survived?

00:38:40.460 --> 00:38:42.320
Why did you burn the Tea King Tree?

00:38:42.890 --> 00:38:44.950
You really don't care if I live or die.

00:38:53.260 --> 00:38:54.380
Why that look?

00:38:55.130 --> 00:38:57.190
Why don't you cry, show weakness,

00:38:57.450 --> 00:38:59.720
or at least try to explain
that you didn't mean it?

00:38:59.720 --> 00:39:00.410
In the past,

00:39:01.560 --> 00:39:03.620
didn't you play that part quite well?

00:39:03.780 --> 00:39:04.910
If you want revenge,

00:39:05.550 --> 00:39:07.380
don't drag the whole Rong Mansion into it.

00:39:07.380 --> 00:39:08.170
The thing you're most proud of

00:39:08.170 --> 00:39:10.030
is the Rong family name, isn't it?

00:39:10.430 --> 00:39:11.940
If I destroy the Rong family,

00:39:11.940 --> 00:39:13.810
will you still be so high and mighty,

00:39:13.810 --> 00:39:15.500
looking down on everyone else?

00:39:15.500 --> 00:39:16.360
Bai Yingsheng.

00:39:17.130 --> 00:39:18.860
You're not this kind of person.

00:39:18.920 --> 00:39:20.780
You don't know me at all.

00:39:24.570 --> 00:39:25.430
Bai Yingsheng.

00:39:25.820 --> 00:39:27.550
Don't go against Rong Shanbao.

00:39:27.650 --> 00:39:28.980
You're no match for her.

00:39:46.490 --> 00:39:47.050
This is

00:39:47.050 --> 00:39:48.260
what you asked me to get earlier.

00:39:48.260 --> 00:39:49.860
The inventory list
of the Wei family's seized assets.

00:39:49.860 --> 00:39:50.660
It's all here.

00:39:58.860 --> 00:39:59.890
This scribe here

00:40:00.570 --> 00:40:02.380
must've been with the County Office
for a long time, right?

00:40:02.380 --> 00:40:03.440
That's Scribe Liu.

00:40:03.970 --> 00:40:04.490
He has served in the office

00:40:04.490 --> 00:40:05.490
for 30 or 40 years.

00:40:13.050 --> 00:40:14.980
Shouldn't you be worried
about the birthday tribute?

00:40:14.980 --> 00:40:16.910
How do you still have time for this?

00:40:25.780 --> 00:40:27.510
Last night at the Rong Mansion,

00:40:27.820 --> 00:40:28.380
someone actually

00:40:28.380 --> 00:40:29.700
managed to burn down

00:40:29.700 --> 00:40:31.220
the Tea King Tree right under your nose.

00:40:31.220 --> 00:40:33.020
My courtyard was being watched.

00:40:33.450 --> 00:40:34.850
How could I possibly know

00:40:35.020 --> 00:40:36.860
everything happening in the mansion?

00:40:36.860 --> 00:40:37.610
But I've always felt

00:40:37.610 --> 00:40:39.020
that you're extraordinary—

00:40:39.020 --> 00:40:40.220
capable of anything.

00:40:41.890 --> 00:40:43.150
I'm not sure I can do it.

00:40:44.220 --> 00:40:44.820
What?

00:40:48.090 --> 00:40:48.820
I said,

00:40:49.970 --> 00:40:51.970
about the
Empress Dowager's birthday tribute,

00:40:51.970 --> 00:40:53.500
I'm not sure I can handle it.

00:41:00.390 --> 00:41:01.100
So what?

00:41:01.970 --> 00:41:03.290
Through thick and thin,

00:41:03.290 --> 00:41:04.890
I'll be right there with you.

00:41:07.420 --> 00:41:08.750
What about your career?

00:41:09.130 --> 00:41:11.000
I've always been alone in this world.

00:41:11.000 --> 00:41:11.960
Wherever you are

00:41:12.740 --> 00:41:13.790
is where I belong.

00:41:27.860 --> 00:41:28.530
Have you heard of

00:41:28.530 --> 00:41:29.790
"Chin Hsiu Wan Hua Ku?"

00:41:33.860 --> 00:41:34.530
What is it?

00:41:34.970 --> 00:41:37.300
It's a rare Song Dynasty book collection.

00:41:37.860 --> 00:41:38.920
For any book lover,

00:41:39.200 --> 00:41:41.930
a single glimpse
would make one's life complete.

00:41:42.170 --> 00:41:43.570
If I remember correctly,

00:41:44.130 --> 00:41:46.660
the Empress Dowager
loves collecting books.

00:41:47.450 --> 00:41:48.710
You're planning to...

00:41:48.740 --> 00:41:49.340
Exactly.

00:41:50.300 --> 00:41:52.630
Her Majesty doesn't truly care about tea.

00:41:52.990 --> 00:41:54.170
She's just curious about the Tea King Tree

00:41:54.170 --> 00:41:55.920
because of its century-old reputation.

00:41:55.920 --> 00:41:57.240
If I cater to her true interests

00:41:57.240 --> 00:41:59.510
and replace the tea
with something she loves,

00:41:59.510 --> 00:42:01.310
I hope it will appease her anger,

00:42:01.860 --> 00:42:03.700
and give the Rong family
a chance to survive.

00:42:03.700 --> 00:42:04.570
So where is

00:42:05.300 --> 00:42:06.650
this rare book collection now?

00:42:06.650 --> 00:42:08.050
When Mrs. Yang was alive,

00:42:08.170 --> 00:42:09.970
she happened to mention it once.

00:42:10.060 --> 00:42:11.500
Wei Kejian had this book

00:42:11.740 --> 00:42:13.800
collected in the Wei family library.

00:42:15.490 --> 00:42:16.610
No wonder you wanted to see

00:42:16.610 --> 00:42:18.820
the inventory list
of the Wei family's seized assets.

00:42:18.820 --> 00:42:20.820
While reviewing the files earlier,

00:42:21.300 --> 00:42:23.570
I learned
that the year Wei Kejian was imprisoned,

00:42:23.570 --> 00:42:24.610
the Wei family servants

00:42:24.610 --> 00:42:26.490
fled with stolen valuables

00:42:26.920 --> 00:42:29.250
and accidentally set the library on fire.

00:42:29.860 --> 00:42:32.570
Could this book have been burned?

00:42:33.260 --> 00:42:35.100
This book is incredibly valuable.

00:42:35.100 --> 00:42:37.700
The Wei family servants
surely knew its value.

00:42:37.740 --> 00:42:39.470
If they were looting the place,

00:42:39.670 --> 00:42:41.780
this book would've been
their first target.

00:42:41.780 --> 00:42:42.380
Wait.

00:42:44.090 --> 00:42:46.940
You asked for the inventory list

00:42:46.940 --> 00:42:48.700
before the Tea King Tree was burned.

00:42:48.700 --> 00:42:50.220
Did you already anticipate

00:42:50.220 --> 00:42:52.260
that something
would happen to the tribute?

00:42:52.260 --> 00:42:52.820
No.

00:42:54.000 --> 00:42:55.450
I asked for the list earlier

00:42:55.450 --> 00:42:55.910
to find the truth

00:42:55.910 --> 00:42:57.370
behind Mrs. Yang's death.

00:42:57.950 --> 00:42:58.830
I was hoping

00:42:59.220 --> 00:43:01.020
if I could find any clues from it.

00:43:01.520 --> 00:43:03.650
Now it turns to be a lucky coincidence.

00:43:07.140 --> 00:43:08.140
Time is precious.

00:43:08.610 --> 00:43:09.580
I need to post notices

00:43:09.580 --> 00:43:11.470
and offer a large reward for this book.

00:43:11.470 --> 00:43:12.800
As for Mrs. Yang's case,

00:43:12.880 --> 00:43:14.850
I'll need your help to investigate it.

00:43:14.850 --> 00:43:17.780
She would never
have taken her own life for no reason.

00:43:19.700 --> 00:43:20.430
Don't worry.

00:43:21.420 --> 00:43:22.750
Justice will be served.

00:43:23.090 --> 00:43:26.090
Those who do evil deeds
will eventually pay the price.

00:46:11.580 --> 00:46:14.030
[Tea Refreshments]

00:46:14.900 --> 00:46:16.430
Eat slowly, take your time.

00:46:16.650 --> 00:46:18.010
China's tea refreshment culture

00:46:18.010 --> 00:46:20.010
can be traced back
to the Tang Dynasty and Song Dynasty.

00:46:20.010 --> 00:46:21.740
During the Tang Dynasty,
the decoction method was popular.

00:46:21.740 --> 00:46:24.110
Tea refreshments were mostly used
to cleanse the palate,

00:46:24.110 --> 00:46:26.100
such as sesame cakes and Bo-tuo noodles,

00:46:26.100 --> 00:46:27.680
as well as preserved dates
and dried lychees.

00:46:27.680 --> 00:46:29.000
These helped balance the tea's bitterness.

00:46:29.000 --> 00:46:31.030
By the Song Dynasty,
the whisking method became trendy.

00:46:31.030 --> 00:46:33.380
Tea refreshments
became more delicate and elegant,

00:46:33.380 --> 00:46:35.860
like fried butter shells and spring rolls.

00:46:35.860 --> 00:46:37.050
They offer a rich variety of textures.

00:46:37.050 --> 00:46:38.550
During the Ming Dynasty and Song Dynasty,

00:46:38.550 --> 00:46:40.140
tea refreshments became more mature.

00:46:40.140 --> 00:46:42.090
During the Ming dynasty, a Tea Bureau
was established for tea banquets,

00:46:42.090 --> 00:46:43.590
serving various cakes and pastries,

00:46:43.590 --> 00:46:45.530
such as osmanthus cake
and gorgon nut cake.

00:46:45.530 --> 00:46:46.380
It also served nuts,

00:46:46.380 --> 00:46:48.650
like fried ginkgo nuts
and salted pine nuts.

00:46:48.650 --> 00:46:49.820
Suzhou-style tea snacks,

00:46:49.820 --> 00:46:51.860
such as sesame biscuits
and rose crisps,

00:46:51.860 --> 00:46:53.200
were paired with Biluochun tea.

00:46:53.200 --> 00:46:54.440
Northern teahouses served

00:46:54.440 --> 00:46:55.510
Manchu-Han pastries,

00:46:55.510 --> 00:46:58.170
like sachima, tuckahoe pie,
and pea flour cake.

00:46:58.260 --> 00:46:59.690
The iconic Qing imperial tea snacks,

00:46:59.690 --> 00:47:00.420
known as the "Jing Ba Jian,"

00:47:00.420 --> 00:47:01.780
were paired with jasmine tea.

00:47:01.780 --> 00:47:03.820
Chaozhou lard sugar pastries

00:47:03.980 --> 00:47:05.560
were paired with Fenghuang Dancong tea.

00:47:05.560 --> 00:47:06.220
What do you think?

00:47:06.220 --> 00:47:07.600
Out of all these tea refreshments,

00:47:07.600 --> 00:47:08.810
is there anything you like?
