WEBVTT

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:28.860
Have a seat.

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:38.520
It's such a thick book.

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:43.440
This will take all night to copy.

00:02:56.320 --> 00:02:58.120
You've been copying for hours.

00:02:58.120 --> 00:02:59.360
When will you finish?

00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:01.480
Read ten thousand books.

00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:03.100
Brew tea like a master.

00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:04.920
Mr. Xu.

00:03:05.520 --> 00:03:07.520
Must you finish all of this tonight?

00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:09.240
I must finish it all tonight.

00:03:11.480 --> 00:03:12.080
Let's go.

00:03:25.960 --> 00:03:27.840
Um, Xu Ziqi.

00:03:28.480 --> 00:03:30.320
Can we just

00:03:30.320 --> 00:03:32.040
go through the basics today?

00:03:34.120 --> 00:03:36.040
You've almost finished the book.

00:03:36.240 --> 00:03:37.520
Just review it at home.

00:03:44.520 --> 00:03:47.050
First, learn how to judge water temperature.

00:03:47.320 --> 00:03:48.200
Different types of tea

00:03:48.200 --> 00:03:50.640
require different water temperatures for brewing.

00:03:50.640 --> 00:03:52.079
Water has three boiling stages.

00:03:52.079 --> 00:03:52.920
Today,

00:03:52.960 --> 00:03:53.760
we'll learn

00:03:53.760 --> 00:03:56.420
how to determine water temperature by bubbles.

00:03:59.400 --> 00:04:00.520
The first boil

00:04:00.920 --> 00:04:03.960
is when bubbles the size of crab eyes form at the bottom.

00:04:03.960 --> 00:04:04.820
The second boil

00:04:05.040 --> 00:04:08.120
is when bubbles the size of fish eyes appear around the edges.

00:04:08.120 --> 00:04:09.120
The third boil

00:04:09.240 --> 00:04:11.320
is when the water roils vigorously.

00:04:11.520 --> 00:04:12.800
I'm starting to boil the water now.

00:04:12.800 --> 00:04:13.930
You need to watch it.

00:04:14.240 --> 00:04:15.800
When it reaches the third boil,

00:04:15.800 --> 00:04:16.640
let me know.

00:04:17.079 --> 00:04:18.760
If your timing is perfect,

00:04:18.760 --> 00:04:19.959
you'll pass the test.

00:04:20.800 --> 00:04:21.320
Here.

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:34.200
First boil.

00:04:48.760 --> 00:04:50.680
Second boil.

00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:56.880
Xu Ziqi.

00:04:59.360 --> 00:05:00.200
Xu Ziqi.

00:05:02.120 --> 00:05:03.520
Xu Ziqi.

00:05:04.800 --> 00:05:06.320
What are you thinking about?

00:05:06.320 --> 00:05:08.000
I called you but you didn't hear me.

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:10.530
Has the water reached the third boil already?

00:05:12.440 --> 00:05:13.240
Yes, it has.

00:05:13.680 --> 00:05:15.880
So have I passed the first test?

00:05:19.360 --> 00:05:20.200
You passed.

00:05:21.120 --> 00:05:21.880
Next,

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:24.930
we'll learn how to make tea powder.

00:05:25.080 --> 00:05:25.880
Sounds good.

00:05:34.200 --> 00:05:36.120
These are the tea powders I made.

00:05:36.680 --> 00:05:37.680
If you can grind tea

00:05:37.680 --> 00:05:39.440
half as fine as mine,

00:05:39.680 --> 00:05:40.880
you'll pass the test.

00:06:03.680 --> 00:06:05.560
What are you doing?

00:06:06.120 --> 00:06:07.920
You have something on your mind.

00:06:10.560 --> 00:06:12.560
You seem a bit off today.

00:06:12.880 --> 00:06:14.480
Is something bothering you?

00:06:14.880 --> 00:06:15.810
Tell me about it.

00:06:16.320 --> 00:06:17.450
Give me a good laugh.

00:06:17.880 --> 00:06:19.440
What's wrong with you?

00:06:19.760 --> 00:06:22.120
So my troubles can entertain you?

00:06:24.520 --> 00:06:25.320
See?

00:06:25.760 --> 00:06:27.690
You do have something on your mind.

00:06:29.120 --> 00:06:31.200
Can you please focus on your studies?

00:06:31.320 --> 00:06:32.250
Look at this tea.

00:06:32.560 --> 00:06:33.560
You've been grinding it forever.

00:06:33.560 --> 00:06:34.960
And it's still inconsistent.

00:06:34.960 --> 00:06:36.290
Can you be more serious?

00:06:38.440 --> 00:06:39.640
What should I do then?

00:06:39.880 --> 00:06:41.280
Why don't you show me how?

00:06:53.120 --> 00:06:55.360
Steady hands, calm mind.

00:06:56.440 --> 00:06:57.320
Be serious.

00:07:02.880 --> 00:07:03.880
What are you doing?

00:07:03.880 --> 00:07:05.080
I'm trying to feel

00:07:05.080 --> 00:07:07.640
how to apply force smoothly and steadily.

00:07:12.240 --> 00:07:13.440
Are you done feeling?

00:07:14.080 --> 00:07:15.340
If you're done, let go.

00:07:15.960 --> 00:07:16.960
Don't disturb me.

00:07:22.800 --> 00:07:24.200
Alright, that's enough.

00:07:24.440 --> 00:07:25.320
Let's move on to the next one.

00:07:25.320 --> 00:07:25.800
O-okay.

00:07:25.880 --> 00:07:28.140
When I say you've passed, you've passed.

00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:43.260
Master, please try it.

00:08:02.680 --> 00:08:06.320
Xu Ziqi, you're really acting strange today.

00:08:08.440 --> 00:08:10.640
The appearance and taste are both good.

00:08:11.200 --> 00:08:12.000
Really?

00:08:12.680 --> 00:08:14.010
Then I'll have a sip too.

00:08:33.760 --> 00:08:35.919
I knew you were acting weird today.

00:08:36.320 --> 00:08:37.559
What's wrong with me?

00:08:39.039 --> 00:08:40.159
You just

00:08:41.799 --> 00:08:43.600
don't want to teach me properly.

00:08:44.320 --> 00:08:45.780
You're hiding something.

00:08:46.200 --> 00:08:46.680
I-

00:08:47.080 --> 00:08:48.880
What could I possibly be hiding?

00:08:49.560 --> 00:08:52.200
It's just that you can't learn no matter how I teach you.

00:08:52.200 --> 00:08:54.680
What do you mean I can't learn?

00:08:58.600 --> 00:08:59.280
Hey!

00:08:59.400 --> 00:09:01.200
Xu Ziqi, what's wrong?

00:09:01.280 --> 00:09:01.600
Hey!

00:09:12.800 --> 00:09:14.720
Xu Ziqi, open the door!

00:09:15.320 --> 00:09:17.680
I'm sorry, I was wrong.

00:09:17.960 --> 00:09:19.080
You're not hiding anything.

00:09:19.080 --> 00:09:20.800
It's me, I'm being silly.

00:09:21.400 --> 00:09:22.200
Xu Ziqi,

00:09:22.280 --> 00:09:24.280
just pretend nothing happened

00:09:24.840 --> 00:09:26.170
and forgive me, please?

00:09:27.160 --> 00:09:28.200
Xu Ziqi?

00:09:28.320 --> 00:09:29.920
You didn't do anything wrong.

00:09:29.920 --> 00:09:30.980
It's just that I...

00:09:34.840 --> 00:09:36.840
We can't brew tea together anymore.

00:09:38.400 --> 00:09:39.320
Why not?

00:09:39.800 --> 00:09:41.440
Weren't we just fine a moment ago?

00:09:41.440 --> 00:09:42.840
Don't say anything more.

00:09:43.080 --> 00:09:43.920
Some things

00:09:44.280 --> 00:09:46.480
just won't work no matter how hard you try.

00:09:46.480 --> 00:09:47.740
I just tasted your tea.

00:09:48.560 --> 00:09:50.600
Compared to Gu Jin'er's tea,

00:09:50.680 --> 00:09:51.940
yours is far inferior.

00:09:54.560 --> 00:09:55.400
Really?

00:09:56.160 --> 00:09:57.560
It couldn't be more true.

00:09:58.040 --> 00:10:01.100
Just accept that you have no affinity for tea ceremony.

00:10:01.560 --> 00:10:02.620
Let's just give up.

00:10:07.800 --> 00:10:08.600
Hua Xiaofei.

00:10:13.200 --> 00:10:14.040
Xiaofei?

00:10:22.040 --> 00:10:22.800
Xiaofei?

00:10:29.200 --> 00:10:30.130
I've gone crazy.

00:10:30.600 --> 00:10:31.800
What am I even saying?

00:10:34.080 --> 00:10:34.840
Xiaofei.

00:10:36.440 --> 00:10:37.280
Xiaofei.

00:10:38.320 --> 00:10:39.080
Xiaofei.

00:10:39.920 --> 00:10:40.680
Xiaofei.

00:10:41.480 --> 00:10:42.320
Xiaofei.

00:10:42.600 --> 00:10:43.680
Xiaofei.

00:10:44.680 --> 00:10:45.080
Ziqi.

00:10:45.080 --> 00:10:45.560
Ali.

00:10:46.600 --> 00:10:48.130
What are you doing out here?

00:10:48.680 --> 00:10:49.600
Well,

00:10:50.800 --> 00:10:52.460
I'm just taking a walk around.

00:10:54.160 --> 00:10:55.360
Where's Hua Xiaofei?

00:10:55.960 --> 00:10:57.560
She just left.

00:10:58.400 --> 00:11:00.400
Did she learn the tea ceremony that quickly?

00:11:00.400 --> 00:11:01.200
Not really,

00:11:02.440 --> 00:11:04.200
but she learns quite fast.

00:11:04.680 --> 00:11:05.940
She's quite talented.

00:11:08.200 --> 00:11:09.040
So does she

00:11:09.600 --> 00:11:11.800
have any chance of winning the competition?

00:11:11.800 --> 00:11:12.600
Are you

00:11:13.560 --> 00:11:15.440
hoping she'll win or lose?

00:11:18.720 --> 00:11:19.320
Lose.

00:11:19.600 --> 00:11:21.320
Is that what the chamber wants?

00:11:21.320 --> 00:11:21.720
Yes.

00:11:24.080 --> 00:11:24.840
Ali,

00:11:25.800 --> 00:11:27.200
the chamber is corrupt.

00:11:27.680 --> 00:11:29.680
You should find a way to get out soon.

00:11:30.560 --> 00:11:32.320
You know I can't.

00:11:33.960 --> 00:11:36.680
Ziqi, this is my only way to bring my parents

00:11:37.080 --> 00:11:38.160
back home.

00:11:45.680 --> 00:11:47.800
So much for being Tang Dynasty's

00:11:48.200 --> 00:11:50.530
top tea master. All show and no substance.

00:11:54.920 --> 00:11:56.250
Something's not right.

00:11:56.920 --> 00:11:58.920
Although I never studied it before,

00:11:59.400 --> 00:12:01.040
I mastered water observation,

00:12:01.040 --> 00:12:04.320
tea whipping and grinding right away.

00:12:04.920 --> 00:12:06.450
How can I not learn this now?

00:12:06.960 --> 00:12:08.890
Why can't I compete with Gu Jin'er?

00:12:14.080 --> 00:12:14.680
No.

00:12:15.280 --> 00:12:18.280
I need to go back and pester Xu Ziqi to teach me.

00:12:21.480 --> 00:12:22.320
Hello, customer.

00:12:22.320 --> 00:12:23.800
This is today's free gift.

00:12:24.200 --> 00:12:26.800
Lychee cherry mare's milk glutinous rice wine

00:12:26.800 --> 00:12:29.130
and pearl glutinous rice ball sweet soup.

00:12:29.600 --> 00:12:30.440
Wait a second.

00:12:31.200 --> 00:12:32.040
Tell me,

00:12:32.720 --> 00:12:33.680
what is this?

00:12:33.720 --> 00:12:34.680
Lychee cherry,

00:12:35.280 --> 00:12:37.140
mare's milk glutinous rice wine,

00:12:37.320 --> 00:12:39.650
and pearl glutinous rice ball sweet soup.

00:12:40.480 --> 00:12:41.200
Thank you.

00:12:41.440 --> 00:12:42.370
Enjoy your meal.

00:12:47.920 --> 00:12:49.440
Mare's milk...

00:12:50.440 --> 00:12:51.480
Pearls...

00:12:53.160 --> 00:12:55.200
Mare's milk...

00:12:57.800 --> 00:12:59.680
Bubble tea!

00:13:04.040 --> 00:13:05.200
Bubble tea!

00:13:05.960 --> 00:13:07.080
Isn't that tea too?

00:13:20.200 --> 00:13:21.000
You're awake.

00:13:29.960 --> 00:13:31.800
Why am I at your place?

00:13:32.960 --> 00:13:34.560
You got drunk last night.

00:13:34.840 --> 00:13:36.080
So I brought you back.

00:13:44.080 --> 00:13:47.160
Xu Ziqi, why are you here?

00:13:47.440 --> 00:13:48.960
I don't want to talk to you.

00:13:52.200 --> 00:13:56.320
Are you here to spy on my secrets?

00:13:58.040 --> 00:13:59.600
I was drunk.

00:14:00.160 --> 00:14:02.440
You brought me home.

00:14:04.440 --> 00:14:06.320
Where else could I take you?

00:14:09.200 --> 00:14:10.440
That makes sense.

00:14:18.560 --> 00:14:19.720
What's this?

00:14:19.720 --> 00:14:20.440
You forgot?

00:14:21.680 --> 00:14:23.200
This is your signature move.

00:14:23.200 --> 00:14:24.480
Last night,

00:14:24.480 --> 00:14:26.280
I used all my strength

00:14:26.440 --> 00:14:28.560
but couldn't pry it from your hands.

00:14:28.600 --> 00:14:31.200
Your secret weapon to victory.

00:14:31.800 --> 00:14:32.400
Treasure.

00:14:39.040 --> 00:14:41.200
The greatest tea master of Tang Dynasty.

00:14:41.200 --> 00:14:44.720
I'll brew you a very special tea.

00:14:49.040 --> 00:14:49.900
Just do as I say.

00:14:49.920 --> 00:14:51.280
It'll definitely work out.

00:14:51.280 --> 00:14:51.920
Boss Xu!

00:14:54.200 --> 00:14:54.720
Boss!

00:14:58.400 --> 00:14:58.960
Coming!

00:15:00.960 --> 00:15:01.560
Boss!

00:15:02.440 --> 00:15:04.680
We've searched the entire Chang'an City

00:15:04.680 --> 00:15:05.600
for this horse milk,

00:15:05.600 --> 00:15:07.130
sheep milk, and camel milk.

00:15:08.320 --> 00:15:09.200
The task you gave us,

00:15:09.200 --> 00:15:10.200
we've accomplished it.

00:15:10.200 --> 00:15:10.680
So,

00:15:10.960 --> 00:15:12.360
we'll take our leave now.

00:15:12.680 --> 00:15:13.680
Stop right there.

00:15:15.440 --> 00:15:16.440
What's the rush?

00:15:16.680 --> 00:15:17.720
I still have something for you.

00:15:17.720 --> 00:15:18.480
Come in.

00:15:19.480 --> 00:15:20.320
Boss,

00:15:20.680 --> 00:15:22.200
how about this?

00:15:22.200 --> 00:15:24.040
Just let us off the hook today.

00:15:24.800 --> 00:15:26.680
Miss Xiaofei's concoctions...

00:15:27.440 --> 00:15:29.840
we really don't deserve such treatment.

00:15:30.920 --> 00:15:32.720
You seem quite bothered about having tea with me.

00:15:32.720 --> 00:15:33.440
No, no.

00:15:34.040 --> 00:15:34.500
Come in.

00:15:54.080 --> 00:15:56.210
I've never seen anyone cook like this.

00:15:56.560 --> 00:15:57.400
Sit down.

00:15:59.400 --> 00:16:00.200
Take a seat.

00:16:01.560 --> 00:16:02.480
Sit.

00:16:03.720 --> 00:16:04.560
Have a seat.

00:16:05.320 --> 00:16:05.720
Sit.

00:16:17.280 --> 00:16:19.280
Try the food in the white bowl first.

00:17:43.920 --> 00:17:44.920
Goodbye, Mr. Xu.

00:17:47.000 --> 00:17:47.440
Hey!

00:17:49.520 --> 00:17:49.980
This...

00:18:11.000 --> 00:18:12.240
It's too gamey.

00:18:13.200 --> 00:18:17.240
Looks like camel and goat milk won't work.

00:18:17.960 --> 00:18:19.560
We'll have to use cow's milk.

00:18:19.880 --> 00:18:22.440
Cow's milk? Isn't that water buffalo milk?

00:18:23.600 --> 00:18:25.640
Water buffalo milk isn't gamey,

00:18:26.600 --> 00:18:28.120
but it's not creamy enough.

00:18:28.120 --> 00:18:29.920
We need to use dairy cows.

00:18:30.240 --> 00:18:31.280
Dairy cows?

00:18:32.400 --> 00:18:34.360
You don't have dairy cows here?

00:18:35.600 --> 00:18:36.730
Never heard of them.

00:18:41.880 --> 00:18:43.840
Dairy cows are like yellow cattle

00:18:44.360 --> 00:18:45.820
but they don't have horns.

00:18:56.360 --> 00:19:00.680
I mean the horns on their heads,

00:19:00.840 --> 00:19:02.240
not that they don't have feet.

00:19:02.240 --> 00:19:04.440
They're black and white,

00:19:09.040 --> 00:19:10.640
with patches of both colors.

00:19:17.480 --> 00:19:18.540
Let me do it myself.

00:19:36.960 --> 00:19:37.720
This...

00:19:38.440 --> 00:19:40.200
This is a dairy cow.

00:19:41.440 --> 00:19:42.000
Well,

00:19:42.720 --> 00:19:44.520
use your drawing for the outline

00:19:44.520 --> 00:19:45.920
and mine for the pattern.

00:19:58.480 --> 00:19:59.120
Yes,

00:19:59.600 --> 00:20:00.400
that's it.

00:20:00.680 --> 00:20:02.810
I've never seen a cow like this before.

00:20:04.360 --> 00:20:06.720
Does the Tang Dynasty really not have these animals?

00:20:06.720 --> 00:20:07.760
In all my life,

00:20:07.880 --> 00:20:08.960
I've never seen

00:20:09.000 --> 00:20:10.330
or heard of such a thing.

00:20:14.840 --> 00:20:15.640
It seems

00:20:17.240 --> 00:20:19.960
we'll have to use the last option.

00:20:24.160 --> 00:20:25.220
What are you doing?

00:20:25.440 --> 00:20:27.000
Hua Xiaofei, calm down!

00:20:27.440 --> 00:20:28.000
What are you doing?

00:20:28.000 --> 00:20:29.000
Xu Ziqi.

00:20:29.680 --> 00:20:31.960
Please teach me the art of tea ceremony.

00:20:33.200 --> 00:20:34.480
I'll go find a cow right now.

00:20:34.480 --> 00:20:35.680
I'll go immediately.

00:20:50.480 --> 00:20:52.600
Have you two ever seen this species?

00:20:53.040 --> 00:20:53.520
No.

00:20:54.160 --> 00:20:55.040
Really haven't.

00:20:55.040 --> 00:20:55.960
Truly never seen it.

00:20:55.960 --> 00:20:57.240
I don't know what it is.

00:20:57.400 --> 00:20:58.400
What is this, sir?

00:21:01.480 --> 00:21:03.140
Master Xu, please take a look.

00:21:03.200 --> 00:21:04.120
Is it this?

00:21:10.120 --> 00:21:12.200
What on earth is this?

00:21:19.680 --> 00:21:21.210
I heard these small animals

00:21:21.240 --> 00:21:23.280
love to run wild on slopes like this.

00:21:24.200 --> 00:21:25.330
If we just wait here,

00:21:25.440 --> 00:21:27.960
one will surely run right into us.

00:21:29.120 --> 00:21:30.780
Waiting for prey to come to us.

00:21:30.920 --> 00:21:32.280
Boss Xu! Boss Xu!

00:21:32.960 --> 00:21:34.560
You need to check on Miss Fei.

00:21:34.600 --> 00:21:35.520
She's messing with the horses.

00:21:35.520 --> 00:21:36.780
The men can't stop her.

00:21:36.840 --> 00:21:37.360
What?

00:21:37.440 --> 00:21:38.920
Miss Fei was trying to milk the horses.

00:21:38.920 --> 00:21:40.960
She was chasing them around the stable.

00:21:40.960 --> 00:21:43.290
And then... then she got kicked by a horse.

00:21:43.640 --> 00:21:44.170
Let's go.

00:21:44.200 --> 00:21:45.480
Come on, hurry!

00:21:50.240 --> 00:21:52.040
It's so hard.

00:21:59.040 --> 00:22:00.300
Sir, the horse is fine.

00:22:10.120 --> 00:22:10.680
Xiaofei.

00:22:11.600 --> 00:22:12.400
Are you okay?

00:22:38.440 --> 00:22:39.120
This...

00:22:40.920 --> 00:22:41.600
This...

00:22:53.920 --> 00:22:55.120
Just this little bit.

00:22:55.240 --> 00:22:56.770
I don't know if it's enough.

00:23:14.720 --> 00:23:15.240
What...

00:23:26.920 --> 00:23:29.040
What's wrong? Is it not enough?

00:23:29.200 --> 00:23:30.760
If it's not enough, I can go get more.

00:23:30.760 --> 00:23:31.720
Don't cry.

00:23:32.040 --> 00:23:32.960
No need.

00:23:34.720 --> 00:23:37.840
Thank you, Xu Ziqi.

00:23:38.440 --> 00:23:41.280
I just wanted to win too badly.

00:23:44.120 --> 00:23:47.880
Look what I've done to you.

00:23:50.360 --> 00:23:51.520
I'm fine.

00:23:52.120 --> 00:23:53.250
Please stop crying.

00:23:55.840 --> 00:23:56.840
Don't cry.

00:23:58.960 --> 00:23:59.760
It's okay.

00:24:16.840 --> 00:24:17.520
Sir.

00:24:19.840 --> 00:24:21.640
Mr. Xu, are you looking for cows?

00:24:22.960 --> 00:24:25.200
Miss Yang, do you know where I can find cows?

00:24:25.200 --> 00:24:26.960
Although the Tang Dynasty doesn't have cows,

00:24:26.960 --> 00:24:27.760
I

00:24:27.760 --> 00:24:30.160
have heard about these animals from Western merchants.

00:24:30.160 --> 00:24:31.880
Would you be so kind as to share

00:24:31.960 --> 00:24:33.720
where I might find such animals?

00:24:33.720 --> 00:24:35.760
I can. But I have one condition.

00:24:36.520 --> 00:24:37.450
What condition?

00:24:38.520 --> 00:24:41.180
This is a red string from the Matchmaker Temple.

00:24:41.640 --> 00:24:44.120
I have confirmed my feelings for you,

00:24:44.360 --> 00:24:46.220
and hope you will accept this gift

00:24:46.440 --> 00:24:48.040
and wear this string of fate.

00:24:49.040 --> 00:24:49.880
Miss Yang,

00:24:51.000 --> 00:24:52.120
such matters

00:24:52.720 --> 00:24:55.180
aren't appropriate to express so directly.

00:24:55.240 --> 00:24:56.200
Why not?

00:24:56.480 --> 00:24:57.280
Well,

00:24:57.640 --> 00:24:58.360
these

00:24:58.640 --> 00:25:01.720
intimate matters should be decided by parents,

00:25:01.920 --> 00:25:02.440
and shouldn't be...

00:25:02.440 --> 00:25:03.200
Sir,

00:25:03.400 --> 00:25:04.680
I only know books,

00:25:05.280 --> 00:25:07.520
but I've learned much from them.

00:25:07.960 --> 00:25:08.880
In this life,

00:25:08.960 --> 00:25:10.960
one should act with honesty and integrity,

00:25:10.960 --> 00:25:13.220
not be hindered by worldly conventions.

00:25:13.440 --> 00:25:14.440
Once the heart is moved,

00:25:14.440 --> 00:25:16.100
one should express it openly.

00:25:16.440 --> 00:25:20.170
I consider myself accomplished in both literary and martial arts.

00:25:34.520 --> 00:25:35.200
Sir.

00:25:41.120 --> 00:25:43.720
Miss Yang, I cannot accept your red string.

00:25:44.200 --> 00:25:45.600
Please go home, Miss Yang.

00:25:45.600 --> 00:25:46.040
Fine.

00:25:46.600 --> 00:25:47.960
I will go back for now.

00:25:48.200 --> 00:25:51.000
I'll return when you've sorted out your thoughts.

00:25:51.240 --> 00:25:52.840
The cow is on West Mountain.

00:25:54.000 --> 00:25:54.860
I take my leave.

00:25:55.680 --> 00:25:56.440
Miss Yang.

00:25:58.120 --> 00:26:00.720
Even though you've told me where the cow is,

00:26:01.360 --> 00:26:03.240
I still cannot agree to your terms.

00:26:03.240 --> 00:26:05.500
There was never any need for conditions.

00:26:05.760 --> 00:26:07.440
I was merely testing you.

00:26:08.360 --> 00:26:10.720
If you had agreed so easily,

00:26:10.960 --> 00:26:13.090
that would have been too calculating.

00:26:13.280 --> 00:26:15.280
Now I've confirmed that

00:26:15.600 --> 00:26:17.440
you are exactly the kind of person

00:26:17.440 --> 00:26:19.440
with true feelings and character that I want.

00:26:19.440 --> 00:26:21.960
I'll go back and wait until you've sorted your thoughts.

00:26:21.960 --> 00:26:23.620
Then you will understand that

00:26:23.760 --> 00:26:26.240
Debiao is your perfect match.

00:26:27.440 --> 00:26:28.300
I take my leave.

00:26:38.440 --> 00:26:39.440
West Mountain.

00:26:49.720 --> 00:26:50.580
One hour later,

00:26:50.600 --> 00:26:52.240
the second round of the competition begins.

00:26:52.240 --> 00:26:54.040
What's wrong with Hua Xiaofei?

00:26:54.040 --> 00:26:55.520
She seems to have no fighting spirit.

00:26:55.520 --> 00:26:57.520
She'll definitely lose this round.

00:27:05.040 --> 00:27:06.360
Xu Ziqi.

00:27:15.760 --> 00:27:16.920
Cow.

00:27:22.520 --> 00:27:23.120
Um,

00:27:23.880 --> 00:27:26.680
I heard there were Hu people raising these in the western mountains,

00:27:26.680 --> 00:27:28.040
so I just went to take a look.

00:27:28.040 --> 00:27:29.960
Surprisingly, they really had some.

00:27:29.960 --> 00:27:30.890
That's amazing!

00:27:30.960 --> 00:27:32.480
I love you so much, Xu Ziqi!

00:27:36.680 --> 00:27:37.440
Hey,

00:27:38.040 --> 00:27:39.160
the competition is about to start.

00:27:39.160 --> 00:27:41.220
You should hurry so you won't be late.

00:27:41.760 --> 00:27:42.820
Aren't you coming?

00:27:43.440 --> 00:27:45.680
I have some urgent business to take care of now.

00:27:45.680 --> 00:27:47.340
I'll come over after I'm done.

00:27:48.160 --> 00:27:49.400
Alright, I'll wait for you.

00:27:49.400 --> 00:27:50.200
Well,

00:27:51.000 --> 00:27:53.200
I'll leave this cow with you then.

00:27:53.440 --> 00:27:53.970
Go ahead.

00:27:57.440 --> 00:27:58.440
Cow.

00:28:33.200 --> 00:28:36.240
These Hu people's weapons are really formidable.

00:28:37.160 --> 00:28:39.360
Hua Xiaofei's hand is way too heavy.

00:28:47.440 --> 00:28:49.680
In this Flower Queen competition,

00:28:51.440 --> 00:28:55.480
there's a woman named Hua Xiaofei who has some skills.

00:28:55.480 --> 00:28:58.240
Your Majesty wants to help her become the Flower Queen

00:28:58.240 --> 00:29:00.960
to use her as a pawn to infiltrate the merchant guild.

00:29:00.960 --> 00:29:01.760
Your Majesty,

00:29:02.520 --> 00:29:03.520
I believe

00:29:04.200 --> 00:29:05.530
this is inappropriate.

00:29:06.360 --> 00:29:07.760
Why is it inappropriate?

00:29:08.280 --> 00:29:10.840
Hua Xiaofei has no relatives,

00:29:11.120 --> 00:29:12.760
making her difficult to control.

00:29:12.760 --> 00:29:14.000
Second, her personality is reckless,

00:29:14.000 --> 00:29:14.960
hard to manage.

00:29:15.680 --> 00:29:18.760
Therefore, I believe she is not a good candidate.

00:29:19.680 --> 00:29:21.600
I have also heard

00:29:22.280 --> 00:29:25.400
about the various incidents this woman has caused in Chang'an.

00:29:25.400 --> 00:29:26.200
Indeed,

00:29:26.760 --> 00:29:28.640
she's not an obedient woman.

00:29:29.200 --> 00:29:30.440
She doesn't listen at all

00:29:30.440 --> 00:29:32.360
and is extremely difficult to control.

00:29:32.360 --> 00:29:34.640
I will have someone discipline her.

00:29:35.720 --> 00:29:39.160
The eunuchs in the palace are very experienced.

00:29:39.760 --> 00:29:42.160
There's no one they cannot train properly.

00:30:12.240 --> 00:30:14.000
Smooth sailing.

00:30:14.640 --> 00:30:16.600
Great fortune and prosperity.

00:30:21.200 --> 00:30:21.680
Good.

00:30:29.040 --> 00:30:29.920
What is that?

00:30:30.440 --> 00:30:30.920
Sir,

00:30:31.480 --> 00:30:33.040
what's this troublemaker doing here?

00:30:33.040 --> 00:30:33.770
I don't know.

00:30:39.480 --> 00:30:40.600
Is that Xu the foreman

00:30:40.600 --> 00:30:42.800
who brought it back from West Mountain?

00:30:43.200 --> 00:30:46.400
Brother, what is the former sister-in-law leading?

00:30:46.600 --> 00:30:47.200
Yes,

00:30:47.400 --> 00:30:48.160
it looks

00:30:49.960 --> 00:30:51.160
like a bull.

00:30:52.120 --> 00:30:52.760
Ladies and gentlemen,

00:30:52.760 --> 00:30:53.200
the

00:30:53.480 --> 00:30:55.440
second round of the Oiran Competition,

00:30:55.440 --> 00:30:57.480
the tea ceremony contest will begin shortly.

00:30:57.480 --> 00:30:58.280
First,

00:30:58.720 --> 00:31:00.920
let me introduce the contestants.

00:31:02.000 --> 00:31:04.960
Last year's Oiran champion, Miss Gu Jin'er.

00:31:07.760 --> 00:31:08.600
[Applause]

00:31:09.160 --> 00:31:11.440
And her assistant, Miss Huan'er.

00:31:13.240 --> 00:31:14.600
This year's dark horse,

00:31:15.160 --> 00:31:16.920
Miss Hua Xiaofei.

00:31:21.760 --> 00:31:23.600
And her assistant

00:31:24.240 --> 00:31:25.760
Cow.

00:31:28.040 --> 00:31:31.570
Ladies and gentlemen, let me introduce the competition rules.

00:31:32.120 --> 00:31:33.680
This tea ceremony competition

00:31:33.680 --> 00:31:35.880
will focus on tea brewing skills.

00:31:36.760 --> 00:31:38.240
No specific tea variety is required.

00:31:38.240 --> 00:31:39.240
No specific water source is required.

00:31:39.240 --> 00:31:40.680
No specific utensils are required.

00:31:40.680 --> 00:31:44.240
Everything is up to the two contestants.

00:31:45.040 --> 00:31:45.960
Finally,

00:31:45.960 --> 00:31:49.440
the taste and spiritual essence of the brewed tea

00:31:49.600 --> 00:31:51.200
will be the basis for voting.

00:31:52.160 --> 00:31:53.440
The contestant with more votes

00:31:53.440 --> 00:31:56.240
will be the winner of the second round.

00:31:58.440 --> 00:31:59.240
Ladies,

00:31:59.640 --> 00:32:00.600
please prepare.

00:32:11.280 --> 00:32:11.810
Brother.

00:32:12.360 --> 00:32:12.880
What

00:32:13.440 --> 00:32:15.900
does the former sister-in-law mean by this?

00:32:18.360 --> 00:32:19.360
Our Koi Alliance

00:32:19.600 --> 00:32:20.960
is blessed by the koi

00:32:20.960 --> 00:32:23.220
requires daily fish-touching rituals.

00:32:24.440 --> 00:32:26.240
Look at Xiaofei's cow

00:32:26.720 --> 00:32:27.960
with its majestic presence,

00:32:27.960 --> 00:32:29.040
unique patterns,

00:32:29.160 --> 00:32:30.240
smooth horns,

00:32:30.280 --> 00:32:31.760
it's no ordinary creature.

00:32:31.760 --> 00:32:33.520
I bet it must be her

00:32:34.640 --> 00:32:35.640
guardian beast.

00:32:37.520 --> 00:32:38.000
Guardian beast.

00:32:38.000 --> 00:32:39.600
Brother, you're brilliant.

00:32:39.720 --> 00:32:40.360
Of course.

00:32:43.840 --> 00:32:45.100
Let's get to business.

00:32:46.880 --> 00:32:48.680
Everyone raise your signs up

00:32:49.600 --> 00:32:52.120
and cheer for Gu Jin'er with me.

00:32:52.120 --> 00:32:53.640
Go Gu Jin'er!

00:32:53.640 --> 00:32:56.520
Gu Jin'er will win!

00:32:56.520 --> 00:32:59.600
Go Gu Jin'er!

00:32:59.600 --> 00:33:01.000
Gu Jin'er will win!

00:33:06.480 --> 00:33:09.640
Go Hua Xiaofei!

00:33:09.960 --> 00:33:11.440
Go Gu Jin'er!

00:33:11.440 --> 00:33:12.840
Go Hua Xiaofei!

00:33:12.880 --> 00:33:15.840
Come on! Go Hua Xiaofei!

00:33:15.840 --> 00:33:17.400
Go Hua Xiaofei!

00:33:17.440 --> 00:33:19.120
Go Hua Xiaofei!

00:33:19.120 --> 00:33:23.360
Go Hua Xiaofei!

00:33:23.440 --> 00:33:25.120
Go Gu Jin'er!

00:33:26.200 --> 00:33:26.840
Erha,

00:33:27.600 --> 00:33:29.800
did you prepare everything I asked for?

00:33:32.840 --> 00:33:33.520
Sir, look.

00:33:33.880 --> 00:33:35.840
All set. Absolutely valuable.

00:33:36.600 --> 00:33:37.160
Sir,

00:33:37.440 --> 00:33:40.760
is this a congratulatory gift for Miss Jin'er's victory?

00:33:41.040 --> 00:33:42.000
This is for

00:33:42.000 --> 00:33:44.440
comforting Hua Xiaofei after her defeat.

00:33:45.920 --> 00:33:46.920
For Hua Xiaofei?

00:33:49.040 --> 00:33:49.880
Alright.

00:33:55.960 --> 00:34:00.440
Ladies and gentlemen, I declare the competition officially open.

00:34:00.440 --> 00:34:02.000
Great!

00:34:02.480 --> 00:34:03.520
Excellent!

00:34:04.920 --> 00:34:05.720
Good!

00:34:06.920 --> 00:34:07.880
Well done!

00:34:08.159 --> 00:34:08.960
Nice!

00:34:16.840 --> 00:34:17.600
Brother.

00:34:18.880 --> 00:34:21.340
Sister-in-law's movements are so elegant.

00:34:21.800 --> 00:34:22.560
Beautiful!

00:34:39.960 --> 00:34:42.620
What on earth is the former sister-in-law up to?

00:34:43.120 --> 00:34:44.040
I have no idea.

00:34:54.639 --> 00:34:57.640
Sir, look at Miss Jin'er's movements.

00:34:58.040 --> 00:35:00.040
She's truly as beautiful as a heavenly fairy.

00:35:00.040 --> 00:35:02.100
Much better than that troublemaker.

00:35:15.400 --> 00:35:16.530
Wait for my command.

00:35:16.960 --> 00:35:17.490
Yes, sir.

00:35:30.160 --> 00:35:33.560
The art of tea ceremony emphasizes tranquility and stillness.

00:35:33.560 --> 00:35:35.520
Miss Hua Xiaofei's behavior

00:35:35.880 --> 00:35:37.280
is truly inappropriate.

00:35:37.720 --> 00:35:38.800
What is this thing?

00:35:39.000 --> 00:35:40.460
I've never seen it before.

00:36:07.760 --> 00:36:08.800
Time's up.

00:36:09.080 --> 00:36:11.960
Would both contestants please present their tea.

00:36:29.960 --> 00:36:32.960
This tea is called 'Transcending to Immortality.'

00:36:33.520 --> 00:36:36.040
I have chosen the finest Xiangyu tea.

00:36:36.600 --> 00:36:38.600
As its name suggests,

00:36:38.800 --> 00:36:40.460
it has a lingering fragrance.

00:36:40.960 --> 00:36:42.640
I brewed it quickly with boiling water

00:36:42.640 --> 00:36:44.400
to preserve its richest aroma.

00:36:45.000 --> 00:36:47.840
The tea is light yet has a profound aftertaste.

00:36:48.160 --> 00:36:49.240
It makes one feel

00:36:49.240 --> 00:36:51.480
ethereal yet grounded.

00:36:52.320 --> 00:36:54.640
Throughout the tea preparation,

00:36:54.640 --> 00:36:57.440
my movements mimicked the divine dance from Chu poetry.

00:36:57.440 --> 00:36:59.500
Striving for elegance and softness,

00:36:59.840 --> 00:37:01.440
that's why this tea is called

00:37:01.720 --> 00:37:03.580
'Transcending to Immortality.'

00:37:03.640 --> 00:37:04.400
Good.

00:37:09.520 --> 00:37:10.920
The aroma is rich,

00:37:11.000 --> 00:37:13.260
and this tea has remarkable complexity.

00:37:13.600 --> 00:37:16.120
It truly lives up to its name 'Transcending to Immortality.'

00:37:16.120 --> 00:37:18.880
Miss Jin, your tea skills are truly exceptional.

00:37:39.240 --> 00:37:41.500
This tea is called 'Birth of All Things.'

00:37:41.560 --> 00:37:45.080
'Birth of All Things.' Quite an ambitious name.

00:37:45.280 --> 00:37:46.320
With tea in hand,

00:37:46.440 --> 00:37:47.900
the world is in your heart.

00:37:48.240 --> 00:37:49.280
I was wondering

00:37:49.440 --> 00:37:52.920
if it's possible to put everything in one cup of tea.

00:37:53.240 --> 00:37:54.840
This tea contains milk,

00:37:54.840 --> 00:37:56.120
rice, sugar,

00:37:56.120 --> 00:37:58.380
salt, the sweet and sour taste of lychee,

00:37:58.440 --> 00:38:01.120
and even the essence of the firewood used to boil the water.

00:38:01.120 --> 00:38:04.320
All the essentials of daily life - fuel, rice, oil, salt, sauce, vinegar, tea -

00:38:04.320 --> 00:38:07.080
I've tried to blend them all into this bowl.

00:38:07.800 --> 00:38:10.860
Everyone, please use this small straw to drink the tea.

00:38:10.960 --> 00:38:13.560
You'll suck up these small black pellets.

00:38:18.520 --> 00:38:20.450
Don't they look like black pearls?

00:38:21.080 --> 00:38:24.160
I believe life is about finding pearls

00:38:24.360 --> 00:38:25.640
in the ordinary moments.

00:38:25.640 --> 00:38:28.120
That's why this tea is called 'Birth of All Things.'

00:38:28.120 --> 00:38:30.360
Good.

00:38:31.040 --> 00:38:33.840
Excellent.

00:38:36.080 --> 00:38:36.920
Mr. Liu Bo,

00:38:37.400 --> 00:38:39.200
you're a master in the tea world.

00:38:39.240 --> 00:38:41.440
What do you think of this tea?

00:38:42.160 --> 00:38:43.960
Miss Hua, this cup of Wanwu Sheng

00:38:44.000 --> 00:38:46.360
truly has a distinctive flavor,

00:38:46.560 --> 00:38:47.820
with a smooth texture,

00:38:48.480 --> 00:38:50.040
the sweet freshness of tea

00:38:50.280 --> 00:38:52.400
and the richness of milk fragrance.

00:38:53.880 --> 00:38:56.760
Especially those tapioca pearls.

00:38:56.960 --> 00:38:58.890
The texture of those little pearls

00:39:00.440 --> 00:39:01.840
is simply amazing.

00:39:02.360 --> 00:39:03.040
Indeed.

00:39:03.040 --> 00:39:04.440
It's truly something that cannot be described

00:39:04.440 --> 00:39:05.520
in words.

00:39:06.320 --> 00:39:09.120
Do you feel especially happy while drinking it?

00:39:09.160 --> 00:39:11.080
Very, very happy.

00:39:11.440 --> 00:39:12.040
Yes.

00:39:12.440 --> 00:39:14.760
That's exactly why I developed this tea.

00:39:15.320 --> 00:39:16.960
Everything has life.

00:39:16.960 --> 00:39:18.480
Life is joyful.

00:39:18.800 --> 00:39:21.360
Drinking tea is about experiencing this joy.

00:39:23.960 --> 00:39:24.490
Brother,

00:39:24.640 --> 00:39:25.700
it tastes amazing.

00:39:25.840 --> 00:39:27.920
It's really delicious.

00:39:28.440 --> 00:39:30.040
How can there be

00:39:30.040 --> 00:39:32.280
such wonderful tea in this world?

00:39:32.320 --> 00:39:34.440
My life is complete now.

00:39:36.480 --> 00:39:38.320
You're being too dramatic.

00:39:41.800 --> 00:39:43.000
We are already happy.

00:39:43.120 --> 00:39:44.280
Indeed happy.

00:39:44.760 --> 00:39:45.520
Sir,

00:39:45.960 --> 00:39:48.720
these judges seem genuinely happy.

00:39:49.520 --> 00:39:50.600
If this continues,

00:39:50.760 --> 00:39:53.240
we'll be the unhappy ones.

00:39:55.360 --> 00:39:56.280
Let's wait and see.

00:39:56.280 --> 00:39:59.440
Please welcome Mr. Yang to announce the results.

00:40:02.160 --> 00:40:05.320
Miss Gu Jin'er's tea ceremony shows exquisite traditional skills

00:40:05.320 --> 00:40:06.400
with remarkable techniques.

00:40:06.400 --> 00:40:09.120
Miss Xiaofei's tea ceremony demonstrates innovation

00:40:09.120 --> 00:40:10.720
with unique craftsmanship.

00:40:10.880 --> 00:40:11.840
For this round,

00:40:11.960 --> 00:40:15.600
we judges unanimously agree that both performances are equally matched

00:40:15.600 --> 00:40:18.040
and equally excellent. We declare it

00:40:19.280 --> 00:40:19.960
a tie.

00:40:19.960 --> 00:40:21.960
What? How can it be a tie?

00:40:23.400 --> 00:40:24.160
Everyone,

00:40:24.920 --> 00:40:27.360
the judges have declared a tie.

00:40:28.120 --> 00:40:30.050
So the outcome of this second round

00:40:30.240 --> 00:40:32.700
will be decided by all of you in the audience.

00:40:32.720 --> 00:40:34.800
We will now beat the drum ten times,

00:40:35.040 --> 00:40:37.400
and when the drumming stops, voting ends.

00:40:37.440 --> 00:40:39.480
Please cast your votes.

00:40:44.160 --> 00:40:45.440
When the drum sounds,

00:40:45.440 --> 00:40:47.560
voting begins.

00:41:10.560 --> 00:41:11.090
Brother,

00:41:11.800 --> 00:41:13.530
go vote for Jin'er and Xiaofei,

00:41:14.040 --> 00:41:15.100
20,000 votes each.

00:41:15.280 --> 00:41:15.800
Yes.

00:41:16.320 --> 00:41:16.850
Let's go.

00:41:19.720 --> 00:41:21.440
[Two drum beats]

00:41:37.520 --> 00:41:38.080
What's

00:41:38.840 --> 00:41:39.760
going on here?

00:41:40.960 --> 00:41:41.800
Sir.

00:41:47.960 --> 00:41:49.090
Could Master Yang be

00:41:49.880 --> 00:41:51.740
having a reaction to the milk tea?

00:41:52.520 --> 00:41:54.640
Did it give Master Yang

00:41:55.160 --> 00:41:56.280
an upset stomach?

00:41:58.520 --> 00:42:00.360
I think so, brother.

00:42:00.720 --> 00:42:01.960
I drank a bowl of it too.

00:42:01.960 --> 00:42:03.440
[Three drum beats]

00:42:14.760 --> 00:42:16.440
[Four drum beats]

00:42:17.360 --> 00:42:18.160
Erha.

00:42:18.720 --> 00:42:19.720
Let them begin.

00:42:20.120 --> 00:42:22.120
Remember, at all costs,

00:42:22.280 --> 00:42:23.480
push up Gu Jin'er's votes.

00:42:23.480 --> 00:42:23.960
Yes.

00:42:34.960 --> 00:42:36.640
[Five drum beats]

00:42:51.440 --> 00:42:53.160
[Six drum beats]

00:43:04.240 --> 00:43:06.120
[Seven drum beats]

00:43:06.960 --> 00:43:09.440
The money for the courtesan election tickets

00:43:09.440 --> 00:43:11.480
I will have someone

00:43:11.480 --> 00:43:13.480
deliver it to you before the voting.

00:43:13.960 --> 00:43:14.760
Remember,

00:43:15.240 --> 00:43:17.120
I want Hua Xiaofei

00:43:17.800 --> 00:43:19.160
Serve my purpose.

00:43:33.400 --> 00:43:35.280
Eight drum beats.

00:43:46.600 --> 00:43:48.320

Ten drum beats.

00:44:06.560 --> 00:44:07.890
Stop. Seal the ballots.

00:44:21.640 --> 00:44:22.900
Ladies and gentlemen,

00:44:22.960 --> 00:44:24.160
Gu Jin'er received

00:44:24.560 --> 00:44:27.480
106,345 votes.

00:44:28.920 --> 00:44:30.120
Hua Xiaofei received

00:44:30.360 --> 00:44:32.960
83,274 votes.

00:44:35.400 --> 00:44:36.460
I hereby announce.

00:44:36.520 --> 00:44:39.800
The winner of the second round tea ceremony contest

00:44:40.160 --> 00:44:40.920
in the courtesan competition: Gu Jin'er.

00:44:40.920 --> 00:44:42.920
Great!

00:44:57.120 --> 00:44:58.280
Follow my signal.

00:44:58.720 --> 00:45:00.920
Cast all your votes for Gu Jin'er.

00:45:02.160 --> 00:45:04.840
We absolutely cannot give Hua Xiaofei any chance to recover.

00:45:04.840 --> 00:45:06.040
Before my ancestors,

00:45:06.600 --> 00:45:08.260
I, Ziqi, am disobeying orders

00:45:08.360 --> 00:45:09.890
out of absolute necessity.

00:45:10.120 --> 00:45:12.380
If Hua Xiaofei wins the courtesan title,

00:45:12.720 --> 00:45:15.480
she will be innocently drawn into court disputes,

00:45:15.480 --> 00:45:16.940
lose her freedom forever,

00:45:17.040 --> 00:45:18.770
and her life would be in danger.

00:45:18.800 --> 00:45:20.560
I don't wish to harm the innocent,

00:45:20.560 --> 00:45:21.820
which is why I disobey.

00:45:21.960 --> 00:45:23.880
If I can protect Hua Xiaofei,

00:45:24.120 --> 00:45:27.560
I will devote my life to serving the people.

00:45:28.440 --> 00:45:31.320
I will expose the conspiracy behind all this.

00:45:35.600 --> 00:45:36.440
Ladies.

00:45:37.320 --> 00:45:40.520
The final round of the courtesan competition will focus on attire and makeup.

00:45:40.520 --> 00:45:41.360
In ten days,

00:45:41.480 --> 00:45:42.240
we will continue here.

00:45:42.240 --> 00:45:43.040
Attire and makeup.

00:45:43.040 --> 00:45:44.240
However, in three days,

00:45:44.240 --> 00:45:47.400
you must confirm your registration at the registration site.

00:45:47.400 --> 00:45:48.160
Ladies,

00:45:48.560 --> 00:45:49.760
see you in three days.

00:46:11.440 --> 00:46:12.440
Let's go back now.

00:46:26.840 --> 00:46:28.700
I'll prepare everything for you.

00:46:35.000 --> 00:46:36.080
Master Zhang,

00:46:36.600 --> 00:46:38.480
why are you in such a hurry?

00:46:38.960 --> 00:46:41.040
Oh, it's Instructor Xue.

00:46:43.760 --> 00:46:46.040
Instructor Xue, please accept this.

00:46:46.040 --> 00:46:46.800
Are these

00:46:54.840 --> 00:46:55.840
all for me?

00:47:01.240 --> 00:47:02.480
Master Zhang,

00:47:02.600 --> 00:47:06.080
I can see your sincerity toward our Jin'er.

00:47:06.160 --> 00:47:08.720
These gifts are enough for you and your brothers

00:47:08.720 --> 00:47:10.480
to stay here for a while.

00:47:11.040 --> 00:47:12.760
However, there's one thing I must remind you of,

00:47:12.760 --> 00:47:13.600
which is:

00:47:13.600 --> 00:47:16.440
Do not disturb Miss Jin'er's life.

00:47:16.960 --> 00:47:18.360
Rest assured, Instructor Xue.

00:47:18.360 --> 00:47:19.960
I will lead my brothers

00:47:20.360 --> 00:47:23.760
to quietly protect Miss Jin'er,

00:47:24.040 --> 00:47:27.120
and ensure she experiences no discomfort whatsoever.

00:47:29.080 --> 00:47:29.880
Perfect.

00:47:31.240 --> 00:47:31.920
Brother.

00:47:31.920 --> 00:47:32.480
Yes?

00:47:32.480 --> 00:47:34.010
Guard this place carefully

00:47:34.360 --> 00:47:36.280
and don't let any man in.

00:47:36.280 --> 00:47:36.960
Yes, sir.

00:47:37.440 --> 00:47:39.440
[Complete surveillance coverage]

00:47:46.640 --> 00:47:48.370
Over there. And over there too.

00:47:53.280 --> 00:47:54.800
Jin'er, don't worry.

00:47:55.160 --> 00:47:56.560
When it comes to fashion,

00:47:57.480 --> 00:47:59.520
Hua Xiaofei will definitely lose.

00:48:02.720 --> 00:48:03.720
But she always

00:48:03.720 --> 00:48:05.760
has some strange ideas.

00:48:06.480 --> 00:48:08.360
I still can't let my guard down.

00:48:08.880 --> 00:48:09.410
Alright.

00:48:10.040 --> 00:48:11.640
Come on, I'll go out first.

00:48:11.880 --> 00:48:13.610
Try on these two outfits again.

00:48:42.480 --> 00:48:43.760
It doesn't matter. It doesn't matter.
