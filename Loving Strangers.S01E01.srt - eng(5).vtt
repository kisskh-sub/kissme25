00:16:32.390 --> 00:16:33.490
He'll be out in a minute.

00:16:33.870 --> 00:16:35.100
You'll hear it from him.

00:16:39.200 --> 00:16:41.370
In Phase Ⅲ of SA-0988,

00:16:42.150 --> 00:16:42.770
we enrolled

00:16:42.770 --> 00:16:44.250
1,500 patients.

00:16:44.600 --> 00:16:45.850
One case was reported

00:16:46.480 --> 00:16:47.530
as a SUSAR,

00:16:48.960 --> 00:16:51.130
a suspected unexpected serious adverse reaction.

00:16:52.080 --> 00:16:54.100
I think SA-0988's safety

00:16:55.030 --> 00:16:56.300
needs further monitoring.

00:16:56.870 --> 00:16:57.580
It's just one case.

00:16:57.790 --> 00:16:59.250
That won't affect our submission

00:16:59.270 --> 00:17:00.100
to the authorities

00:17:00.120 --> 00:17:02.010
of the SA-0988 marketing application.

00:17:02.750 --> 00:17:03.610
Under filing requirements,

00:17:03.630 --> 00:17:04.900
all adverse-event reports

00:17:04.920 --> 00:17:05.940
must be submitted.

00:17:06.480 --> 00:17:07.050
The regulator

00:17:07.070 --> 00:17:07.860
will likely reject

00:17:07.880 --> 00:17:08.620
our marketing application

00:17:08.750 --> 00:17:10.090
because of this SUSAR.

00:17:10.880 --> 00:17:12.460
If we take more time

00:17:12.750 --> 00:17:14.620
to further refine SA-0988,

00:17:15.070 --> 00:17:15.900
and get

00:17:15.920 --> 00:17:17.050
stronger trial data,

00:17:18.000 --> 00:17:19.700
our chances will be higher

00:17:20.720 --> 00:17:22.090
when we file again.

00:17:22.090 --> 00:17:24.140
But that's not your call!

00:17:25.270 --> 00:17:27.180
SA-0988 is in the whole company's

00:17:27.200 --> 00:17:28.010
best interest.

00:17:28.510 --> 00:17:29.860
If one adverse reaction,

00:17:29.880 --> 00:17:31.180
one we don't even know

00:17:31.200 --> 00:17:32.330
was caused

00:17:32.350 --> 00:17:32.980
by SA-0988,

[Internal Decision Meeting on SA-0988 Marketing Approval]

00:17:40.720 --> 00:17:41.180
Fine.

00:17:42.880 --> 00:17:44.460
I can agree to file...

00:17:49.550 --> 00:17:50.900
on the condition we follow the rules

00:17:51.510 --> 00:17:51.980
and submit

00:17:52.000 --> 00:17:52.570
all adverse-event reports,

00:17:52.590 --> 00:17:53.900
including the SUSAR,

00:17:53.920 --> 00:17:54.700
in the same submission.

Let him speak.

00:18:03.350 --> 00:18:04.490
Selling drugs for profit

00:18:05.200 --> 00:18:06.220
is of course in our pharma's

00:18:06.240 --> 00:18:07.220
best interest.

00:18:08.510 --> 00:18:09.730

bottom line?

00:18:13.510 --> 00:18:13.980
If a drug

00:18:14.510 --> 00:18:15.180
doesn't heal,

00:18:15.480 --> 00:18:16.380
and costs lives,

00:18:17.070 --> 00:18:18.290
isn't that ruining our name?

00:18:18.790 --> 00:18:19.530
I'd say

00:18:20.750 --> 00:18:23.700
we pause the SA-0988 filing

00:18:24.310 --> 00:18:24.810
for now.

00:18:27.830 --> 00:18:28.900
We should be more cautious.

00:18:30.070 --> 00:18:32.220
Let's reassess it?

00:18:33.720 --> 00:18:34.860
Mr. Gu, what do you think?

00:18:50.270 --> 00:18:51.460

No wonder.
