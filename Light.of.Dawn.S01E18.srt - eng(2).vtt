=Light of Dawn=

00:02:03.879 --> 00:02:04.439
Do not move.

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:07.840
I know I cannot get away anymore.

00:02:08.680 --> 00:02:09.840
But still,

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:13.520
there are things I want to
say to you and the girl.

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:15.719
Do you really not want to know

00:02:15.719 --> 00:02:18.680
how your biological father,
Yang Wenyuan,

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:20.840
actually died?

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:24.639
Chen Kang will tell you
the time and place.

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:26.759
Only you and Feifei come.

00:02:50.439 --> 00:02:52.360
Can you move her to another room?

00:02:58.280 --> 00:02:58.800
Mom.

00:03:01.130 --> 00:03:02.510
I've already talked to the doctor.

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:05.199
You need a light,
high protein diet for now.

00:03:06.599 --> 00:03:07.879
I made crucian carp soup at home.

00:03:09.080 --> 00:03:11.800
I picked out all the bones for you.

00:03:15.759 --> 00:03:16.360
Gao Feng.

00:03:18.439 --> 00:03:20.879
I owe you an apology
on Gao Dahua's behalf.

00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:30.800
Mom.

00:03:31.039 --> 00:03:31.960
Don't call me Mom.

00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:34.439
I don't deserve it.

00:03:36.360 --> 00:03:37.879
After what Gao Dahua did,

00:03:38.800 --> 00:03:40.800
I no longer deserve
to hear you call me that.

00:03:42.280 --> 00:03:43.199
What's going on?

00:03:46.159 --> 00:03:47.919
So much has happened lately.

00:03:49.960 --> 00:03:51.680
I've already found my biological mother,

00:03:52.800 --> 00:03:54.840
and the truth
about my background is almost clear.

00:03:55.680 --> 00:03:56.360
And yet,

00:03:58.960 --> 00:04:00.039
you don't want me anymore.

00:04:07.400 --> 00:04:08.960
How could I not want you?

00:04:11.100 --> 00:04:12.990
Gao Feng,
these past couple of days lying here,

00:04:13.960 --> 00:04:16.319
everything in my head
keeps replaying like a movie.

00:04:17.720 --> 00:04:19.100
I kept thinking and thinking,

00:04:19.110 --> 00:04:21.319
and there are so many things
I just can't figure out.

00:04:22.160 --> 00:04:24.199
All my life, following Gao Dahua,

00:04:24.680 --> 00:04:27.000
we never lived
a rich or privileged life.

00:04:27.160 --> 00:04:28.600
I never asked for wealth.

00:04:28.920 --> 00:04:30.839
All I wanted was to live honestly,

00:04:30.839 --> 00:04:32.480
and to have a child.

00:04:34.480 --> 00:04:36.639
When Gao Dahua brought you home,

00:04:37.519 --> 00:04:39.639
I knew I had a son. I...

00:04:40.600 --> 00:04:42.439
From that moment on,

00:04:42.439 --> 00:04:44.519
I knew I would owe him
for the rest of my life.

00:04:46.600 --> 00:04:49.000
He carried such a huge secret
in his heart.

00:04:49.040 --> 00:04:50.000
He couldn't tell me,

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:51.399
and he couldn't tell you either.

00:04:54.480 --> 00:04:56.319
So he drove himself to ruin.

00:04:57.730 --> 00:04:59.959
In the end, you could say
he paid for it with his life.

00:05:03.639 --> 00:05:04.800
How is your recovery?

00:05:06.120 --> 00:05:06.879
Pretty good.

00:05:08.170 --> 00:05:09.920
After I found out Gao Feng
was your brother,

00:05:11.120 --> 00:05:12.279
I was actually really happy.

00:05:14.300 --> 00:05:16.040
Don't you think
relationships between people

00:05:16.040 --> 00:05:17.250
can be something truly amazing?

00:05:19.279 --> 00:05:22.160
Sometimes you meet someone
for the first time

00:05:23.550 --> 00:05:24.879
and it already feels like family.

00:05:28.600 --> 00:05:31.399
You're also the person closest
to Gao Feng now.

00:05:33.040 --> 00:05:34.040
I want to know,

00:05:35.079 --> 00:05:37.079
what kind of person is he in your eyes?

00:05:44.279 --> 00:05:45.680
I'd like to know that too.

00:05:47.600 --> 00:05:50.000
We failed you, Gao Feng.

00:05:51.519 --> 00:05:53.240
We truly failed you.

00:05:53.240 --> 00:05:53.759
Mom.

00:05:55.160 --> 00:05:56.360
Please listen to me carefully.

00:05:57.360 --> 00:05:58.920
You spent half your life living for him,

00:05:58.920 --> 00:06:00.210
and half your life living for me.

00:06:01.600 --> 00:06:03.279
Can't you live for yourself now?

00:06:04.839 --> 00:06:06.790
From now on,
all of us should live for ourselves.

00:06:11.360 --> 00:06:12.519
All these past years,

00:06:14.279 --> 00:06:15.639
whether love or hatred,

00:06:18.079 --> 00:06:20.150
the people who've died,
and everything from the past,

00:06:21.240 --> 00:06:22.600
have trapped me for far too long.

00:06:23.720 --> 00:06:24.800
But I know very clearly

00:06:26.560 --> 00:06:27.680
that it's all over now.

00:06:28.800 --> 00:06:30.600
I used to be obsessed
with finding the truth,

00:06:31.879 --> 00:06:33.519
with no room to live my own life.

00:06:35.240 --> 00:06:36.639
But people grow up.

00:06:38.959 --> 00:06:40.120
Now I finally see it clearly.

00:06:41.160 --> 00:06:42.079
What you gave me

00:06:43.519 --> 00:06:44.240
was real.

00:06:50.319 --> 00:06:51.199
So now,

00:06:53.279 --> 00:06:54.720
we should all move forward.

00:06:55.839 --> 00:06:56.360
Yes.

00:07:02.240 --> 00:07:03.759
You will always be my son,

00:07:05.839 --> 00:07:07.319
my very best son.

00:07:47.160 --> 00:07:47.839
What's wrong?

00:07:50.319 --> 00:07:51.439
Wu Guohao sent word.

00:07:52.120 --> 00:07:53.120
He wants to see me.

00:07:54.639 --> 00:07:56.000
The police are about to catch him.

00:07:57.040 --> 00:07:59.190
When someone is cornered,
they're capable of anything.

00:07:59.759 --> 00:08:01.160
For him to reach out to you now,

00:08:02.519 --> 00:08:03.360
aren't you afraid?

00:08:04.480 --> 00:08:05.600
I was scared before.

00:08:06.600 --> 00:08:09.279
But now that it's come to this,
I'm not anymore.

00:08:10.279 --> 00:08:11.199
But I am.

00:08:14.959 --> 00:08:17.639
All this time,
you were digging into your past,

00:08:18.120 --> 00:08:20.160
turning all of Binchuan upside down.

00:08:20.720 --> 00:08:22.279
You were walking on the edge every day,

00:08:22.480 --> 00:08:23.839
and I supported you the whole way.

00:08:24.480 --> 00:08:25.600
But this time is different.

00:08:33.519 --> 00:08:34.519
I'll come back.

00:08:35.799 --> 00:08:36.960
Can you trust me just once?

00:08:38.600 --> 00:08:39.879
I've been an orphan for so long.

00:08:40.500 --> 00:08:41.600
It's time to change my fate.

I already talked to the police.

00:10:29.519 --> 00:10:30.919
I was just worried about you.

00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:33.490
I thought you might not be used to
staying in a hotel like this,

00:10:34.039 --> 00:10:35.560
so I bought you some daily essentials.

00:10:36.279 --> 00:10:37.720
Some common medicine,

00:10:38.300 --> 00:10:39.200
and health supplements.

00:10:40.039 --> 00:10:41.399
A face mask and an eye mask.

00:10:41.810 --> 00:10:43.759
Most importantly,
these sheets and duvet covers.

00:10:44.480 --> 00:10:45.720
I'll change them for you first.

00:10:46.279 --> 00:10:47.159
Just make do for now.

00:11:06.840 --> 00:11:08.279
It's still early for that.

00:11:11.360 --> 00:11:11.919
I know.

00:11:12.960 --> 00:11:15.720
I just happened to pass
a maternity and baby store,

00:11:16.279 --> 00:11:18.519
and saw all those tiny clothes
and little socks.

00:11:20.200 --> 00:11:21.399
They were just too cute.

00:11:24.300 --> 00:11:25.820
I couldn't help myself and bought them.

00:11:27.879 --> 00:11:29.240
Isn't fate strange?

00:11:30.279 --> 00:11:33.240
I always thought I was just an orphan.

00:11:35.360 --> 00:11:36.399
And suddenly,

00:11:38.320 --> 00:11:39.320
I'm going to be an uncle.

00:11:40.800 --> 00:11:42.430
I'm not very good
at buying these things.

00:11:42.440 --> 00:11:43.600
They might be a bit big.

00:11:44.559 --> 00:11:45.440
But that's okay.

00:11:45.799 --> 00:11:48.080
In a few years, when the child grows up,

00:11:49.100 --> 00:11:49.990
they'll fit just fine.

00:11:51.039 --> 00:11:51.799
Thank you.

00:12:14.039 --> 00:12:14.720
Well,

00:12:15.279 --> 00:12:18.000
there are some steam eye masks in there.

00:12:19.080 --> 00:12:20.039
They help you sleep.

00:12:21.360 --> 00:12:21.879
You…

00:12:24.570 --> 00:12:25.360
Get some good rest.

00:12:42.400 --> 00:12:44.080
The reason we even met
in the first place

00:12:44.080 --> 00:12:46.090
was because neither of us knew
who we really were.

00:12:46.519 --> 00:12:48.519
We worked together to get to the truth.

00:12:49.399 --> 00:12:50.130
Just the two of us.

00:12:53.600 --> 00:12:54.879
But whatever bond we had,

00:12:56.190 --> 00:12:57.120
this is where it ends.

00:12:58.720 --> 00:12:59.960
Wu Feifei, don't do this.

00:13:16.010 --> 00:13:17.200
What's this supposed to mean?

00:13:18.120 --> 00:13:19.080
Nothing special.

00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:22.440
I just thought it was worth keeping.

00:13:22.879 --> 00:13:24.480
Two people who are actually siblings,

00:13:24.480 --> 00:13:26.279
calling each other besties for a while.

00:13:28.960 --> 00:13:29.919
Isn't that interesting?

00:13:30.320 --> 00:13:31.360
I'll leave it with you.

00:13:39.639 --> 00:13:40.840
We promised each other

00:13:41.320 --> 00:13:42.759
no lies between us, right?

00:13:46.879 --> 00:13:47.720
He asked to meet me.

00:13:48.480 --> 00:13:49.399
He asked you alone?

00:13:49.639 --> 00:13:51.190
Both of us, but I want to go by myself.

00:13:51.240 --> 00:13:51.879
Why?

00:13:52.279 --> 00:13:53.440
This isn't just about you.

00:13:53.679 --> 00:13:55.000
And you should tell the police.

00:13:55.000 --> 00:13:56.279
He still has people helping him.

00:13:56.280 --> 00:13:57.990
That makes it even
more dangerous to go alone.

00:13:58.260 --> 00:14:00.080
I can't even be sure
what he's capable of now.

00:14:00.080 --> 00:14:01.200
We're so close.

00:14:02.399 --> 00:14:03.039
Yang Wenyuan,

00:14:04.399 --> 00:14:05.360
our father,

00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:07.039
I have to know the truth.

00:14:10.639 --> 00:14:11.600
I'm going with you.

00:14:14.000 --> 00:14:15.279
Right now, in this world,

00:14:15.279 --> 00:14:16.399
you're my only family.

00:14:18.279 --> 00:14:19.879
Those little shoes and tiny clothes,

00:14:21.200 --> 00:14:23.159
you can put them
on your nephew yourself someday.

00:14:25.840 --> 00:14:27.279
Both of us have to survive this.

00:14:36.600 --> 00:14:37.080
Feng.

00:14:41.639 --> 00:14:42.559
Don't leave me behind.

00:15:19.159 --> 00:15:21.639
(Sometimes free as air.)

00:15:22.759 --> 00:15:24.679
(Yet always missing a piece of life.)

00:15:28.360 --> 00:15:29.279
(- Now
- Now)

00:15:30.000 --> 00:15:31.440
(- we'll finally have answers.
- we'll finally have answers.)

00:15:31.440 --> 00:15:35.100
♪Why is the truth
always buried in thorns♪

00:15:35.100 --> 00:15:36.860
♪The light will come♪

00:15:38.799 --> 00:15:40.600
Wu Guohao is extremely arrogant.

00:15:41.120 --> 00:15:42.390
The evidence is already airtight,

00:15:42.879 --> 00:15:44.879
yet he still thinks he can walk free.

00:15:45.720 --> 00:15:48.799
The International Club he controlled,
along with its series of crimes,

00:15:49.039 --> 00:15:51.240
may be an extreme case from the 1990s,

00:15:51.480 --> 00:15:52.480
but the nature is vile,

00:15:52.720 --> 00:15:53.559
and the harm immense.

00:15:54.519 --> 00:15:55.039
Su Min.

00:15:55.160 --> 00:15:57.200
Mobilize citywide police forces
and lock this down.

00:15:57.840 --> 00:15:59.200
Wu Guohao

00:15:59.639 --> 00:16:00.919
and his entire criminal network

00:16:01.279 --> 00:16:02.639
must face justice.

00:16:02.960 --> 00:16:03.919
- Yes.
- Yes.

00:17:06.000 --> 00:17:06.839
Everyone's here.

00:17:07.920 --> 00:17:09.680
Come on. Let's have a drink.

00:17:15.599 --> 00:17:16.279
Feifei.

00:17:17.640 --> 00:17:18.680
How have you been lately?

00:17:19.960 --> 00:17:23.079
Now that you've found your real brother,
you've forgotten your dad?

00:17:24.440 --> 00:17:25.119
Call me Dad.

00:17:29.039 --> 00:17:29.680
Call me Dad!

00:17:31.880 --> 00:17:32.640
What are you doing?

00:17:34.680 --> 00:17:36.000
You came prepared, didn't you?

00:17:37.640 --> 00:17:39.160
Anyone who wanted me dead

00:17:40.680 --> 00:17:42.079
is already buried underground.

00:17:45.680 --> 00:17:48.240
The girl I raised for over twenty years,

00:17:52.160 --> 00:17:54.039
I just want to see her once.

00:17:58.319 --> 00:18:00.079
And I have to go through you to do it?

00:18:02.559 --> 00:18:05.319
Tell them how you died.

00:18:13.680 --> 00:18:14.400
I forgot.

00:18:15.720 --> 00:18:17.000
He can't speak.

00:18:17.519 --> 00:18:19.799
I smashed his jaw.

00:18:20.720 --> 00:18:21.240
Feifei.

00:18:22.200 --> 00:18:23.720
Do you remember when you were little,

00:18:23.720 --> 00:18:25.690
you were especially scared
of the scar on my hand?

00:18:26.680 --> 00:18:28.359
Whenever I held you,
you would pull away.

00:18:30.480 --> 00:18:32.079
Later on, I even went abroad

00:18:32.079 --> 00:18:33.720
and had several reconstructive surgeries

00:18:34.160 --> 00:18:35.279
before it was finally fixed.

00:18:35.839 --> 00:18:36.400
You forgot?

00:18:46.359 --> 00:18:47.039
Xu.

00:18:48.480 --> 00:18:51.880
Why are you still
such a pathetic coward?

00:18:52.160 --> 00:18:55.079
After all this time,
you still haven't moved on?

00:18:55.839 --> 00:18:58.200
You're still thinking about those lives,

00:18:58.200 --> 00:18:58.799
aren't you?

00:18:59.480 --> 00:19:00.680
Your heart condition

00:19:00.680 --> 00:19:03.559
came from your own indecision.

00:19:04.200 --> 00:19:04.880
Take a look.

00:19:05.480 --> 00:19:08.599
Look how grand Penglai Plaza is now.

00:19:10.359 --> 00:19:14.559
How many people
walk across it every day,

00:19:14.559 --> 00:19:15.759
coming and going.

00:19:16.400 --> 00:19:18.359
All that glory.

00:19:18.480 --> 00:19:20.839
What's a few buried bodies underneath?

00:19:21.839 --> 00:19:24.720
I always believed
there was friendship between us.

00:19:25.359 --> 00:19:27.200
I never wanted to grow old

00:19:27.200 --> 00:19:28.880
and end up this lonely.

00:19:29.400 --> 00:19:31.519
I built such a huge empire,

00:19:31.799 --> 00:19:34.079
yet in the end I can only sit alone,

00:19:35.480 --> 00:19:36.559
drinking old liquor,

00:19:37.240 --> 00:19:38.200
reliving the past.

00:19:39.160 --> 00:19:40.599
I gave you a chance.

00:19:41.480 --> 00:19:43.119
You betrayed me.

00:19:47.680 --> 00:19:48.599
You're here too.

00:19:51.400 --> 00:19:53.720
You think you're worthy
of sitting at this table?

00:19:54.200 --> 00:19:57.640
You're the one
who hid right under my nose,

00:19:58.079 --> 00:19:59.759
pulling the wool over everyone's eyes.

00:20:00.720 --> 00:20:01.839
Infertile, right?

00:20:02.400 --> 00:20:03.519
Desperate for a son, right?

00:20:04.000 --> 00:20:04.720
Well, here he is.

00:20:06.720 --> 00:20:08.599
The son you raised

00:20:08.799 --> 00:20:10.000
for over twenty years.

00:20:11.440 --> 00:20:12.839
Isn't that wonderful?

00:20:15.240 --> 00:20:16.039
So wonderful.

00:20:18.680 --> 00:20:20.359
Qu Meng,

00:20:22.079 --> 00:20:24.039
you really were unbelievably foolish.

00:20:25.079 --> 00:20:27.359
I had so many men under me,
yet after all that choosing,

00:20:27.359 --> 00:20:28.680
you picked a so called good man.

00:20:28.799 --> 00:20:29.960
That very good man,

00:20:30.200 --> 00:20:32.960
ended up burying you with his own hands.

00:20:34.640 --> 00:20:36.240
You were truly foolish.

00:20:42.319 --> 00:20:42.960
Hongyue.

00:20:45.440 --> 00:20:47.519
You really were blind.

00:20:48.079 --> 00:20:49.839
I have nothing left to say to you.

00:20:50.880 --> 00:20:51.480
Enough.

00:20:52.440 --> 00:20:55.599
Today, we board the old boat
to meet old friends.

00:20:56.599 --> 00:20:57.920
But after today,

00:20:58.519 --> 00:21:00.400
I will leave Binchuan.

00:21:01.880 --> 00:21:04.519
And you should
go beneath Binchuan as well,

00:21:05.960 --> 00:21:07.400
to rest in peace.

00:21:07.400 --> 00:21:08.980
You really think you can still get away?

00:21:13.240 --> 00:21:14.319
Of course I can.

00:21:15.039 --> 00:21:16.359
And I'll leave

00:21:17.160 --> 00:21:19.319
clearly and in full glory.

00:21:19.920 --> 00:21:20.920
I even made a point

00:21:22.039 --> 00:21:24.599
of preparing a special gift
for the two of you.

00:21:35.039 --> 00:21:38.079
Let today count as your birthday.

00:21:39.200 --> 00:21:41.079
This birthday is from me.

00:21:42.960 --> 00:21:45.680
Yang Wenyuan and Qu Meng
never gave you one.

00:21:56.559 --> 00:21:59.720
♪Happy birthday to you♪

00:22:00.279 --> 00:22:03.160
♪Happy birthday to you both♪

00:22:03.839 --> 00:22:06.799
♪Happy birthday to you♪

00:22:06.799 --> 00:22:07.990
Have you lost your mind enough?

00:22:12.440 --> 00:22:14.440
How can you talk
to your father like that?

00:22:14.880 --> 00:22:16.160
We were father and daughter once.

00:22:18.839 --> 00:22:20.319
That bond was rare enough.

00:22:21.119 --> 00:22:22.759
You used to be the person
I admired most.

00:22:25.880 --> 00:22:27.359
Don't let all those past years

00:22:30.000 --> 00:22:31.680
turn into a joke in the end.

00:22:34.000 --> 00:22:36.440
Wu Guohao,
no matter what you're still plotting,

00:22:36.880 --> 00:22:39.119
whether you plan to take
us hostage to escape,

00:22:39.119 --> 00:22:40.480
or drag us down with you,

00:22:41.599 --> 00:22:42.200
it won't work.

00:22:43.000 --> 00:22:45.240
Today's Binchuan is no longer something
you can control.

00:22:48.039 --> 00:22:48.920
Turn yourself in.

00:22:51.319 --> 00:22:54.160
So the two of you see me as a clown now?

00:22:57.680 --> 00:22:59.559
Some things, if I don't say them,

00:23:00.279 --> 00:23:03.240
you may never know
for the rest of your lives.

00:23:07.400 --> 00:23:09.920
I never left Binchuan
these past few days.

00:23:10.039 --> 00:23:11.720
I stayed here waiting for this,

00:23:11.720 --> 00:23:13.559
the DNA test report.

00:23:14.480 --> 00:23:15.599
I haven't opened it.

00:23:15.759 --> 00:23:16.880
I was waiting for you.

00:23:17.839 --> 00:23:19.039
Let's look at it together.

00:23:23.519 --> 00:23:24.079
Captain Su.

00:23:24.799 --> 00:23:26.640
The DNA test results
for Gao Feng and Wu Feifei

00:23:26.640 --> 00:23:28.359
in relation to Yang Wenyuan are out.

00:23:40.759 --> 00:23:41.839
Then I'll open it.

00:24:06.160 --> 00:24:07.119
We

00:24:08.119 --> 00:24:09.880
are not biologically related.

00:24:09.880 --> 00:24:11.300
(Confirmed: No biological relationship)

00:24:12.580 --> 00:24:13.740
Take a look.

00:24:15.279 --> 00:24:17.599
That's fine.

00:24:19.319 --> 00:24:20.400
That's fine.

00:24:22.400 --> 00:24:23.680
You can leave now.

00:24:24.200 --> 00:24:24.799
Get out.

00:24:28.119 --> 00:24:29.240
Get out now!

00:24:42.480 --> 00:24:45.240
You want revenge
for your mother, don't you?

00:24:47.839 --> 00:24:48.480
Come on.

00:24:57.039 --> 00:24:57.759
Come.

00:24:58.359 --> 00:24:59.000
Wu Guohao.

00:25:00.759 --> 00:25:01.599
You're calculating,

00:25:03.039 --> 00:25:03.799
and so am I.

00:25:04.440 --> 00:25:05.720
Lately I've been thinking,

00:25:06.240 --> 00:25:07.920
why it is that the two of us

00:25:08.440 --> 00:25:10.039
so often arrive at the same conclusions.

00:25:11.559 --> 00:25:12.240
The attic.

00:25:12.480 --> 00:25:13.160
Hongyue.

00:25:13.759 --> 00:25:14.559
Xu Zhiyang.

00:25:16.000 --> 00:25:17.790
That's right.
I'm always one step behind you.

00:25:18.400 --> 00:25:19.650
But afterward, when I look back,

00:25:20.200 --> 00:25:21.720
I realize I always understand you.

00:25:24.359 --> 00:25:25.480
The Penglai office

00:25:25.480 --> 00:25:26.799
was cleaned spotless.

00:25:26.799 --> 00:25:28.750
But after living in Binchuan
for so many years,

00:25:30.319 --> 00:25:33.160
it's not that hard to find traces
you left behind.

00:25:34.440 --> 00:25:35.960
This is an expedited DNA test report

00:25:35.960 --> 00:25:37.720
I had the city bureau run.

00:25:38.400 --> 00:25:39.480
Want to take a look?

00:26:05.500 --> 00:26:07.000
You swallowed a blank sheet of paper.

00:26:08.100 --> 00:26:09.790
If you don't believe me,
see for yourself.

00:26:13.880 --> 00:26:15.400
I never did

00:26:15.400 --> 00:26:16.599
any DNA test at all.

00:26:19.039 --> 00:26:20.079
So I won the bet.

00:26:22.079 --> 00:26:23.119
The report you had

00:26:24.519 --> 00:26:25.519
was fake too.

00:26:29.359 --> 00:26:30.079
This time,

00:26:30.480 --> 00:26:31.720
I was one step ahead of you.

00:26:39.000 --> 00:26:41.559
You know perfectly well
what the truth is.

00:26:42.680 --> 00:26:43.690
As for who you really are,

00:26:45.160 --> 00:26:46.480
I honestly don't care at all,

00:26:48.000 --> 00:26:49.990
because you don't even
deserve to be called human.

00:26:58.100 --> 00:27:02.260
(Early 1990s)

00:28:24.640 --> 00:28:26.079
You monster.

00:28:26.480 --> 00:28:28.039
I'll be waiting for you in hell.

00:28:58.960 --> 00:29:00.079
My teeth.

00:29:00.720 --> 00:29:02.359
You knocked my teeth out.

00:29:04.279 --> 00:29:05.079
Open your mouth.

00:29:14.640 --> 00:29:16.440
How did you figure it out?

00:29:17.359 --> 00:29:18.240
Someone like you

00:29:18.450 --> 00:29:19.559
would never fail to confirm

00:29:19.559 --> 00:29:21.360
your blood relationship
with your daughter.

00:29:21.440 --> 00:29:23.000
You must have tested Feifei long ago,

00:29:23.700 --> 00:29:25.790
otherwise you would never
have kept her by your side.

00:29:27.839 --> 00:29:30.160
Why dig it up to the very end

00:29:31.440 --> 00:29:32.839
like Qu Meng did?

00:29:33.000 --> 00:29:34.990
Because digging to the end
is the only way to reach the truth.

00:29:38.720 --> 00:29:39.880
The very fact that we exist

00:29:40.880 --> 00:29:42.680
is proof of all the evil you committed.

00:29:43.400 --> 00:29:45.359
You think that by pretending
to cut ties with us,

00:29:46.360 --> 00:29:48.200
you could erase
every trace you left behind,

00:29:48.599 --> 00:29:49.640
and escape your crimes?

00:29:52.960 --> 00:29:56.720
Wu Guohao, you spent your whole life
deceiving yourself,

00:29:56.720 --> 00:29:58.519
but we are not like you.

00:30:03.119 --> 00:30:04.480
I've already found our mother.

00:30:06.640 --> 00:30:09.079
I now know how brave she was
to give birth to us,

00:30:11.240 --> 00:30:13.000
and how cruel the evil inflicted

00:30:13.640 --> 00:30:14.680
upon her truly was.

00:30:17.200 --> 00:30:19.440
You could never
be that blank sheet of paper.

00:30:21.000 --> 00:30:22.119
All my searching

00:30:22.119 --> 00:30:23.300
has finally made me understand

00:30:23.559 --> 00:30:24.960
that love and choice

00:30:25.519 --> 00:30:26.799
matter more than anything else.

00:30:29.759 --> 00:30:31.039
And it also taught us

00:30:31.799 --> 00:30:33.559
what truly deserves to be protected.

00:30:34.640 --> 00:30:35.599
Standing before me,

00:30:35.599 --> 00:30:37.039
you are an enemy and a criminal,

00:30:37.520 --> 00:30:39.039
and you will inevitably face justice.

00:30:39.599 --> 00:30:40.519
Aside from your crimes,

00:30:42.480 --> 00:30:44.920
you will leave nothing behind.

00:31:14.119 --> 00:31:14.920
Wu.

00:31:17.279 --> 00:31:18.319
Wu.

00:31:19.960 --> 00:31:21.160
Turn yourself in.

00:31:56.200 --> 00:31:57.079
Sniper in position.

00:32:01.000 --> 00:32:01.839
Contact headquarters.

00:32:01.839 --> 00:32:03.180
Transmit the live feed to command.

00:32:37.200 --> 00:32:38.680
Report. There is a bomb on the ship.

00:32:39.620 --> 00:32:40.790
Evacuate everyone immediately.

00:32:51.800 --> 00:32:52.690
Don't come any closer.

00:32:55.759 --> 00:32:57.559
Don't move.

00:32:58.319 --> 00:32:59.359
You still have a chance.

00:33:03.200 --> 00:33:04.880
I don't have one anymore.

00:33:16.279 --> 00:33:18.200
If the hostages are in danger,

00:33:18.620 --> 00:33:19.720
you are authorized to shoot.

00:33:21.519 --> 00:33:21.960
Understood.

00:33:23.279 --> 00:33:24.240
You won't fire.

00:33:25.519 --> 00:33:26.400
I will.

00:33:28.039 --> 00:33:28.920
You won't.

00:33:30.880 --> 00:33:32.000
You never will.

00:34:18.480 --> 00:34:19.480
Dad!

00:34:37.920 --> 00:34:38.440
Master.

00:34:38.500 --> 00:34:39.599
Chen Kang has been subdued.

00:34:39.880 --> 00:34:41.599
All bombs on the ship
have been dismantled.

00:34:42.119 --> 00:34:43.079
Wu Guohao

00:34:43.079 --> 00:34:44.519
kept resisting to the very end.

00:35:27.320 --> 00:35:28.599
I never imagined Wu Guohao

00:35:30.159 --> 00:35:32.039
would leave in this way.

00:35:34.079 --> 00:35:36.119
He didn't dare
face the judgment of the law,

00:35:37.199 --> 00:35:39.199
and even less the judgment
of his own blood.

00:35:41.800 --> 00:35:43.159
Cause and effect of good and evil

00:35:44.159 --> 00:35:45.360
cannot be stopped by anyone.

00:35:47.800 --> 00:35:49.280
Just like this rushing river,

00:35:49.280 --> 00:35:50.880
it will always flow into the sea.

00:35:51.440 --> 00:35:53.079
No one can make it run backward.

00:35:54.119 --> 00:35:54.880
Wu Guohao

00:35:56.480 --> 00:35:57.480
got what he deserved.

00:36:06.140 --> 00:36:08.741
(After investigation, the People's Court publicly tried Wu Guohao,
the Penglai Group, and related individuals.)

00:36:08.742 --> 00:36:11.482
(Wu Guohao was charged with intentional homicide, arson, rape,
drug trafficking, and organizing prostitution.)

00:36:11.483 --> 00:36:13.766
(He was also charged with organizing and leading a criminal syndicate, unlawful detention, harboring criminals, and other offenses.)

00:36:13.767 --> 00:36:16.146
(Wu Feifei was convicted of intentional injury, perjury,
and harboring criminals, and sentenced to seven years in prison.)

00:36:16.147 --> 00:36:18.342
(Due to pregnancy, and in accordance with Chinese law,
her sentence was temporarily served outside prison.)

00:36:18.343 --> 00:36:20.178
(Xu Zhiyang was convicted of perjury and harboring criminals,
and sentenced to four years in prison.)

00:36:20.179 --> 00:36:22.380
(Due to serious illness and inability to care for himself,
his sentence was also temporarily served outside prison.)

00:36:22.380 --> 00:36:24.508
(Zhao Tianming was convicted of intentional homicide,
organizing prostitution, and drug trafficking.)

00:36:24.509 --> 00:36:26.535
(Combined with arson, harboring criminals,
and perjury, he was sentenced to death.)

00:36:26.536 --> 00:36:28.755
(Chen Kang was convicted of arson, intentional injury,
kidnapping, unlawful detention, and harboring criminals.)

00:36:28.756 --> 00:36:31.581
(For multiple crimes combined, he was sentenced to fifteen years in prison.)

00:36:31.582 --> 00:36:33.418
(The Mingyue Care Center was confirmed
to be an unlawful detention site and has been shut down.)

00:36:33.419 --> 00:36:34.846
(All women who were unlawfully detained have been rescued.)

00:36:34.847 --> 00:36:37.220
(All illegal proceeds of the Penglai Group have been recovered,
confiscated, compensated, and returned.)

00:37:03.079 --> 00:37:03.840
Dawg.

00:37:07.800 --> 00:37:08.840
Dawg, you're awake.

00:37:10.559 --> 00:37:11.159
Dawg.

00:37:13.159 --> 00:37:14.400
I'll go get the doctor.

00:37:19.199 --> 00:37:20.079
Don't go.

00:37:24.760 --> 00:37:25.480
I won't.

00:37:27.639 --> 00:37:28.199
I won't go.

00:37:30.039 --> 00:37:30.599
Okay.

00:37:32.000 --> 00:37:33.679
It feels like I just had

00:37:35.719 --> 00:37:36.440
a long dream.

00:37:39.280 --> 00:37:40.039
Don't be afraid.

00:37:41.800 --> 00:37:42.920
The dream is over.

00:37:45.119 --> 00:37:47.039
You have no idea
how long you were asleep.

00:37:47.639 --> 00:37:49.360
I waited for you for so long.

00:37:51.400 --> 00:37:55.199
The baby and I prayed
for you every single day.

00:37:57.559 --> 00:38:01.400
Now the three of us
are finally together again.

00:38:04.559 --> 00:38:06.159
You've been through so much.

00:38:19.840 --> 00:38:21.159
Watch your step, everyone.

00:38:21.159 --> 00:38:22.880
Take good care of yourselves out there.

00:38:23.800 --> 00:38:24.679
Don't push yourselves.

00:38:24.720 --> 00:38:26.270
If you can't keep going,
tell the team leader,

00:38:26.280 --> 00:38:27.290
and find a place to rest.

00:38:27.440 --> 00:38:28.159
Eat properly.

00:38:28.159 --> 00:38:29.039
Call every night.

00:38:29.119 --> 00:38:30.119
Don't worry.

00:38:31.440 --> 00:38:32.519
The world is so big.

00:38:32.719 --> 00:38:34.440
I should go see it too.

00:38:39.500 --> 00:38:40.320
I'm heading out then.

00:38:40.800 --> 00:38:41.719
I'll walk you down.

00:38:42.639 --> 00:38:43.119
Okay.

00:39:06.679 --> 00:39:07.199
Mom.

00:39:14.100 --> 00:39:15.390
I'll wait for you to come back.

00:39:18.159 --> 00:39:19.039
Don't worry.

00:39:19.800 --> 00:39:20.400
Go on back.

00:39:53.119 --> 00:39:53.719
Feng.

00:39:58.340 --> 00:39:59.239
Are you still leaving?

00:40:02.880 --> 00:40:03.480
No.

00:40:04.039 --> 00:40:05.580
Wherever you are, that's where I'll be.

00:40:26.519 --> 00:40:27.159
(You tell me,)

00:40:28.039 --> 00:40:29.320
(did they ever imagine)

00:40:29.480 --> 00:40:30.960
(that one day we would be reunited?)

00:40:31.800 --> 00:40:33.280
Do you think the two of them

00:40:34.740 --> 00:40:36.320
will ever have that day of recognition?

00:40:37.000 --> 00:40:38.800
(They probably didn't just imagine it.)

00:40:39.320 --> 00:40:42.159
(They must have believed it all along.)

00:40:44.199 --> 00:40:44.840
They will.

00:40:45.440 --> 00:40:46.840
That day will definitely come.

00:40:51.280 --> 00:40:52.880
Not only were we reunited,

00:40:53.519 --> 00:40:56.000
I think we didn't let them down.

00:40:57.510 --> 00:40:59.060
And we didn't let ourselves down either.

00:41:01.119 --> 00:41:02.679
When each of us is born,

00:41:03.559 --> 00:41:05.559
there are so many things
we cannot choose,

00:41:05.960 --> 00:41:07.800
like where we come from,
like blood ties.

00:41:08.559 --> 00:41:09.840
But we should thank ourselves

00:41:10.480 --> 00:41:12.039
for becoming who we wanted to be.

00:41:16.960 --> 00:41:19.159
(Qu Meng, Li Hongyue)
Mom, don't worry.

00:41:20.079 --> 00:41:21.719
The two of us will walk

00:41:22.519 --> 00:41:23.719
our path well.

00:41:25.440 --> 00:41:27.199
(Feng, Feifei)

00:41:27.639 --> 00:41:29.679
(I'm Mom, Qu Meng.)

00:41:31.760 --> 00:41:34.440
(In this lifetime, I've met many people)

00:41:35.039 --> 00:41:36.199
(and sung many songs.)

00:41:37.800 --> 00:41:40.760
(There are many people
in this world like your mother,)

00:41:41.360 --> 00:41:43.519
(who once lived on the edge of chaos,)

00:41:44.320 --> 00:41:48.039
(stumbling through right and wrong,
good and evil, all their lives.)

00:41:49.400 --> 00:41:51.440
(We are all ordinary beyond measure.)

00:41:52.559 --> 00:41:53.400
(We've been lost.)

00:41:54.079 --> 00:41:54.920
(We've been weak.)

00:41:56.039 --> 00:41:57.000
(We've been afraid.)

00:41:58.159 --> 00:42:00.719
(But the ones I love
taught me with their lives)

00:42:01.920 --> 00:42:02.679
(not to be afraid.)

00:42:03.719 --> 00:42:05.190
(Take one step forward with courage,)

00:42:05.719 --> 00:42:08.079
(Awake)
(the darkness will retreat one step.)

00:42:09.199 --> 00:42:10.960
(Light travels
through a thousand years,)

00:42:11.519 --> 00:42:13.559
(and every nightmare will awaken.)

00:42:15.079 --> 00:42:16.159
(Children, don't be afraid.)

00:42:17.280 --> 00:42:18.800
(I can already see you)

00:42:19.639 --> 00:42:21.920
(flying freely, riding the wind.)

00:42:23.559 --> 00:42:24.920
(The smiles on your faces)

00:42:25.239 --> 00:42:26.679
(are enough to light up the stars,)

00:42:27.760 --> 00:42:29.760
(blooming in the future.)
