00:00:02.470 --> 00:00:04.740
(Episode 19)

00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:05.740
That's strange.

00:00:06.340 --> 00:00:07.450
What is it, Dad?

00:00:07.880 --> 00:00:09.110
About the banner.

00:00:10.010 --> 00:00:11.920
If I remember correctly,
she also filed a complaint...

00:00:11.920 --> 00:00:13.520
to have a banner taken down.

00:00:13.750 --> 00:00:16.350
What? CEO Chae Hwa Young did?

00:00:16.520 --> 00:00:18.160
Yes. Do you remember when I told you...

00:00:18.160 --> 00:00:20.590
about the person
who was filing those complaints?

00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:23.860
Yes, we put up those banners
because we were desperate,

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:25.800
but someone complained
that they were an eyesore.

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:29.970
So, the person you mentioned then
was CEO Chae?

00:00:30.070 --> 00:00:32.270
Yes. Strange, isn't it?

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:35.370
I know. She'd be too busy to care,

00:00:35.570 --> 00:00:37.440
but she reported it
just because it was an eyesore.

00:00:38.710 --> 00:00:39.710
No.

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:44.320
Maybe she's just a particular person
who can't stand eyesores.

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:46.350
You think so?

00:00:49.990 --> 00:00:51.360
Anyway, Jang Mi,

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:54.260
what should we do about this?
She forgot to take it with her.

00:00:54.460 --> 00:00:58.930
I'll make a proper one and go see her
at the hotel to introduce myself.

00:00:59.330 --> 00:01:02.670
- Or I'll go with Tae Pyung.
- Right. That's a good idea.

00:01:16.410 --> 00:01:19.150
If you were going to be that tense,
why bother confronting it head-on?

00:01:19.250 --> 00:01:21.320
(CEO Chae Hwa Young)

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:23.690
Is anything ever solved by hiding
and watching from the sidelines?

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:26.960
Sink or swim, I have to face it.

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:30.300
That's the only way
to find a breakthrough.

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:31.960
I suppose so.

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:34.530
You have to know your enemy
to figure out how to deal with them.

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:37.870
Of all the times
for Oh Tae Pyung to walk in.

00:01:38.170 --> 00:01:39.900
Now my cover's blown.

00:01:39.970 --> 00:01:43.040
Actually, this might make it even easier
to buy him off.

00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:45.080
Buy him off?

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:46.710
(CEO Chae Hwa Young)

00:01:46.810 --> 00:01:47.910
What if we did this?

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:54.820
So...

00:01:55.420 --> 00:01:57.860
Do you really like Chef Kang Jun Ho?

00:01:57.990 --> 00:01:59.490
Yes. Why?

00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:03.430
You need to stop.

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:07.670
He's not interested in women.
He's just an incredibly busy workaholic.

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:11.970
What is with you?
What's it to you, Lawyer Kang?

00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:16.270
Besides, whether or not Chef Kang Jun Ho
is interested in women,

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:17.680
how would you know?

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:21.180
Isn't he the head chef
at Chang Restaurant?

00:02:21.550 --> 00:02:23.920
So, of course, he's a workaholic
who doesn't care about anything else.

00:02:24.550 --> 00:02:26.890
You're the one who's being weird,
Lawyer Kang.

00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:30.220
What does that have to do with you,

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:32.760
whether I like Chef Kang Jun Ho or not?

00:02:32.990 --> 00:02:35.430
Why do you care so much?

00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:38.400
I'm just worried
you'll get your hopes up for nothing...

00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:40.430
and end up getting hurt.

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:42.600
For crying out loud! The nerve!

00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:47.370
I don't care if it's false hope.

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:50.040
- What?
- Chef Kang Jun Ho is...

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:52.340
my first love and my idol.

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:55.080
Just seeing him for one second,
even from far away,

00:02:55.780 --> 00:02:57.750
makes me so incredibly happy.

00:03:00.320 --> 00:03:01.990
But what is that?

00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:12.630
All right. In this notebook,

00:03:13.130 --> 00:03:14.830
I want you to show me
how you're feeling...

00:03:15.070 --> 00:03:16.400
by putting a sticker on the page.

00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:19.870
Whether you're happy, sad, or angry.

00:03:24.610 --> 00:03:25.910
Suk Hee is smiling.

00:03:26.240 --> 00:03:27.580
That's great.

00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:29.310
- You're in a great mood right now!
- Yes.

00:03:29.310 --> 00:03:31.080
That's right. That's all you have to do.

00:03:31.480 --> 00:03:33.450
Me too! Let me try!

00:03:34.990 --> 00:03:36.120
Bo Ra's putting one on too.

00:03:41.490 --> 00:03:45.400
Hello there.
And where are you from, little one?

00:03:46.100 --> 00:03:48.370
She's my niece visiting from Vietnam.

00:03:48.370 --> 00:03:49.400
I see.

00:03:49.630 --> 00:03:51.800
Grandma, let's go do this in the room.

00:03:53.040 --> 00:03:54.410
Okay, sure. Go ahead.

00:03:59.780 --> 00:04:00.850
Let's go.

00:04:01.110 --> 00:04:04.020
How did you ever come up with that?

00:04:04.080 --> 00:04:08.050
If she puts on a sticker every day,
her moods become more predictable.

00:04:08.650 --> 00:04:11.560
It helps create a stable routine.

00:04:11.560 --> 00:04:12.690
Goodness.

00:04:12.790 --> 00:04:15.130
She needs to be able to live
as independently as possible...

00:04:15.460 --> 00:04:17.400
so that the whole family
can have some peace of mind.

00:04:19.830 --> 00:04:20.830
Right.

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:22.830
Thank you.

00:04:23.330 --> 00:04:24.340
What was that?

00:04:24.900 --> 00:04:26.970
- I didn't hear you.
- I said, thank you!

00:04:27.070 --> 00:04:28.310
Gosh, you're so loud.

00:04:29.870 --> 00:04:30.980
But...

00:04:31.880 --> 00:04:34.310
Why are you helping me so much?

00:04:35.980 --> 00:04:36.980
Pardon?

00:04:38.020 --> 00:04:39.450
Jang Mi is back!

00:04:39.750 --> 00:04:40.920
I'm so sorry, Mom.

00:04:41.450 --> 00:04:43.960
I said I was just going to the restroom.
You must've been so worried I wasn't back.

00:04:44.590 --> 00:04:46.060
I'm so sorry, okay?

00:04:46.420 --> 00:04:47.560
I'm sorry.

00:04:47.690 --> 00:04:49.430
I'm so sorry, Mom, okay?

00:04:51.800 --> 00:04:54.600
Why are you crying?
I would never leave you.

00:04:56.870 --> 00:05:00.570
Well, Tae Pyung is my best friend,

00:05:01.040 --> 00:05:03.680
and she's his mom,
so it's only natural that I'd help.

00:05:19.260 --> 00:05:21.630
(CEO Chae, I'll be waiting for you
at Luota Cafe at noon.)

00:05:24.130 --> 00:05:25.960
I wonder what's going on with Hwa Young.

00:05:40.240 --> 00:05:41.250
Did you look into it?

00:05:41.310 --> 00:05:45.220
Yes. Jung Suk Hee's other twin
is named Oh Jang Mi.

00:05:45.880 --> 00:05:46.880
Oh Jang Mi?

00:05:50.560 --> 00:05:51.560
Oh Jang Mi.

00:05:52.490 --> 00:05:56.390
So you got lucky and managed to survive
all this time.

00:06:00.360 --> 00:06:01.370
Yes.

00:06:04.740 --> 00:06:05.740
Secretary Kim.

00:06:06.640 --> 00:06:07.970
Secretary Kim, what is this?

00:06:08.940 --> 00:06:10.010
It's...

00:06:10.680 --> 00:06:14.150
Please take this to the Chairman's room.

00:06:14.150 --> 00:06:15.210
I asked you what this is!

00:06:15.210 --> 00:06:16.710
Gosh, you scared me!

00:06:17.980 --> 00:06:19.480
I'm not deaf.

00:06:19.480 --> 00:06:21.320
Have you no class, shouting like that?

00:06:21.390 --> 00:06:23.760
Yeom San Wol,
what do you think you're doing?

00:06:24.220 --> 00:06:26.690
How dare you try to move into my house?

00:06:26.820 --> 00:06:29.530
- The Chairman gave his permission.
- Shut up!

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:34.670
Chairman,
I think you'd better come out here.

00:06:35.430 --> 00:06:37.970
- Chairman!
- Will you shut up?

00:06:38.300 --> 00:06:41.340
What's all this commotion?

00:06:42.710 --> 00:06:44.210
What is the meaning of this, Father?

00:06:44.940 --> 00:06:47.280
- It's exactly what it looks like.
- What?

00:06:47.880 --> 00:06:51.180
So you're really letting Yeom San Wol
and her daughter move into my house?

00:06:51.250 --> 00:06:55.720
Hwa Young, this is my house, not yours.
Don't you forget it!

00:06:55.790 --> 00:06:58.760
It's the home we share, Father.
You, me, and Seo Rin.

00:06:58.820 --> 00:07:02.390
Gosh, she's so loud.
Does she think she owns the place?

00:07:02.460 --> 00:07:06.130
This is unacceptable.
You have to think about Seo Rin, too.

00:07:06.660 --> 00:07:09.770
Never mind me,
but Seo Rin is your granddaughter.

00:07:10.070 --> 00:07:11.940
She's your only blood relative.

00:07:12.770 --> 00:07:16.940
So how can you completely ignore
her wishes and do this?

00:07:17.010 --> 00:07:18.240
That's enough!

00:07:18.980 --> 00:07:21.910
Do I need your permission
just to have guests in my own home?

00:07:21.910 --> 00:07:23.180
Father.

00:07:23.850 --> 00:07:26.820
- Yeom San Wol is my friend.
- Exactly.

00:07:27.250 --> 00:07:31.320
I heard your friend fell on hard times,
so I invited her over.

00:07:31.390 --> 00:07:32.390
What kind of hard times?

00:07:32.460 --> 00:07:35.030
The lease on the studio apartment
I was living in expired,

00:07:35.430 --> 00:07:37.130
and I was about to be kicked out.

00:07:37.800 --> 00:07:40.130
CEO Chae, please give me a break.

00:07:40.130 --> 00:07:42.570
Please? I'll be on my best behavior.

00:07:42.570 --> 00:07:45.840
Ma'am, I know this is inconvenient,
but please let us stay.

00:07:46.570 --> 00:07:48.540
The Chairman himself invited us.

00:07:49.540 --> 00:07:51.710
That's right.
You should be the one to give in.

00:07:52.640 --> 00:07:56.150
I'm not saying I'm going to marry
Mrs. Yeom tomorrow, am I?

00:07:56.610 --> 00:07:58.080
So calm down,

00:07:58.350 --> 00:08:01.350
and explain it nicely to Seo Rin for me.

00:08:04.260 --> 00:08:05.260
You’re being unreasonable.

00:08:06.220 --> 00:08:07.230
CEO Chae!

00:08:08.090 --> 00:08:09.760
My, what a temper.

00:08:11.360 --> 00:08:13.100
Chairman, I'm so sorry.

00:08:20.970 --> 00:08:22.440
Seo Rin, where are you?

00:08:24.140 --> 00:08:26.080
What? You're on your way to a club?

00:08:29.050 --> 00:08:30.380
Your grandfather...

00:08:30.950 --> 00:08:32.650
has let Yeom San Wol and Hong Ju move in.

00:08:33.180 --> 00:08:35.250
Where do you think?
He brought them into our house!

00:08:35.750 --> 00:08:39.320
How can you think about going clubbing
at a time like this?

00:08:39.590 --> 00:08:41.360
What are we going to do?

00:08:45.330 --> 00:08:48.070
Slow down, ma'am.
You're going to get drunk at this rate.

00:08:48.900 --> 00:08:49.900
Just pour.

00:08:50.640 --> 00:08:52.500
There's no way
I can get through tonight sober.

00:09:16.560 --> 00:09:17.560
Hwa Young.

00:09:18.730 --> 00:09:19.730
What?

00:09:20.030 --> 00:09:23.400
- Nam Bong.
- Has something happened?

00:09:24.640 --> 00:09:26.500
Why haven't you been answering my calls?

00:09:31.510 --> 00:09:33.880
What's going on? Is it something bad?

00:09:34.950 --> 00:09:37.450
Yes. It's one bad thing after another.

00:09:38.450 --> 00:09:40.620
It just keeps hitting me like a tsunami.

00:09:41.820 --> 00:09:43.990
It's more than I can handle sober.

00:09:44.820 --> 00:09:46.760
Look, I don't know what's going on.

00:09:47.760 --> 00:09:50.190
You should stop drinking.
You'll ruin your health.

00:09:54.070 --> 00:09:55.700
Are you worried about me?

00:09:57.800 --> 00:10:00.400
In this whole world,
the only one who cares about me...

00:10:04.940 --> 00:10:06.440
is you.

00:10:25.600 --> 00:10:27.670
Just because Hwa Young said that,

00:10:27.670 --> 00:10:29.830
how could the Chairman say
that you and I have to share a room?

00:10:30.270 --> 00:10:32.140
He said all we had to do
was put another bed in his room.

00:10:32.340 --> 00:10:35.640
Mom, you don't think the Chairman
is actually powerless, do you?

00:10:36.110 --> 00:10:38.610
What if we've completely misjudged
who really runs this house?

00:10:38.680 --> 00:10:40.110
Please. Give me a break.

00:10:40.950 --> 00:10:43.650
How could the Chairman
flip on a dime like that?

00:10:43.950 --> 00:10:46.080
He acted like I'd be sharing his room,

00:10:46.480 --> 00:10:48.120
and then he just kicked me out like this?

00:10:48.120 --> 00:10:49.790
I'm so upset.

00:10:49.850 --> 00:10:52.390
At this rate,
forget about ever marrying the Chairman.

00:10:52.660 --> 00:10:55.990
You'll just be stuck
as his live-in maid forever.

00:10:56.060 --> 00:10:59.500
That is absolutely not happening.
I'll do whatever it takes...

00:10:59.800 --> 00:11:01.430
to seduce the Chairman,
one way or another.

00:11:01.500 --> 00:11:03.700
If you knock over an old man,
he'll break a hip.

00:11:04.070 --> 00:11:05.640
And you'll be the one
who has to nurse him back to health.

00:11:07.270 --> 00:11:08.270
Hey, Hong Ju.

00:11:08.710 --> 00:11:11.510
But what if Chae Hwa Young is really
the one calling the shots here?

00:11:11.840 --> 00:11:12.840
What are we going to do?

00:11:13.280 --> 00:11:15.610
All our hard work will have been
for nothing, won't it?

00:11:15.910 --> 00:11:16.950
I've figured it out.

00:11:17.850 --> 00:11:19.420
The one who really runs this house is...

00:11:19.850 --> 00:11:20.850
Who?

00:11:21.320 --> 00:11:24.390
- Ma Seo Rin.
- What? Seo Rin?

00:11:24.490 --> 00:11:27.120
When CEO Chae started going on about...

00:11:27.120 --> 00:11:29.690
Seo Rin being his only flesh and blood,

00:11:29.690 --> 00:11:31.360
the Chairman immediately caved, didn't he?

00:11:31.430 --> 00:11:33.400
Oh my gosh, you're right.

00:11:33.460 --> 00:11:37.030
Mom, what if Seo Rin decides
to kick us out for good?

00:11:37.270 --> 00:11:41.510
What do you think we'll do?
We'll have to grovel at her feet.

00:11:42.440 --> 00:11:43.840
And at the same time,

00:11:43.840 --> 00:11:47.310
we'll just have to keep working
to win over the Chairman.

00:11:47.650 --> 00:11:49.180
What a life!

00:11:49.180 --> 00:11:51.220
I'm destined to be a servant!

00:11:51.550 --> 00:11:53.050
I can't believe this.

00:12:10.900 --> 00:12:13.900
I'm so upset that I just want
to run away and disappear.

00:12:16.970 --> 00:12:17.980
Who...

00:12:18.710 --> 00:12:22.280
would dare to upset my Hwa Young?

00:12:23.180 --> 00:12:26.220
But please don't drink your problems away.
It's bad for your health, Hwa Young.

00:12:28.750 --> 00:12:29.850
If I don't drink,

00:12:31.060 --> 00:12:34.560
who is there to understand how I feel?

00:12:36.390 --> 00:12:37.430
You have me.

00:12:39.330 --> 00:12:41.970
Hwa Young,
I want you to remember something.

00:12:43.170 --> 00:12:44.840
When you're happy and life is good,

00:12:46.100 --> 00:12:49.640
you'll have plenty of people around,
so you don't have to remember me.

00:12:50.310 --> 00:12:51.310
But...

00:12:52.180 --> 00:12:54.450
when you're struggling
and you feel all alone,

00:12:56.450 --> 00:12:57.680
remember me.

00:13:02.390 --> 00:13:04.260
I'll always be there to protect you.

00:13:05.960 --> 00:13:06.960
Really?

00:13:08.660 --> 00:13:10.230
You'll really protect me?

00:13:10.930 --> 00:13:13.130
Of course. I'll be like your shadow.

00:13:14.230 --> 00:13:15.230
Because you...

00:13:16.630 --> 00:13:18.370
are so precious to me.

00:13:30.710 --> 00:13:32.880
Hwa Young! Pull yourself together!

00:13:35.390 --> 00:13:36.890
Stay with me.

00:13:39.690 --> 00:13:40.690
Please.

00:13:44.600 --> 00:13:46.600
I saw the men who took down the banner.

00:13:46.930 --> 00:13:47.930
Men?

00:13:51.670 --> 00:13:54.070
So? Seems like we've got
a real witness, right?

00:13:54.740 --> 00:13:57.740
Gosh, why am I such a genius?

00:13:57.910 --> 00:14:00.180
Do you happen to have the dashcam footage?

00:14:00.210 --> 00:14:01.410
(Coffee Lover)

00:14:01.450 --> 00:14:04.280
I'll check if the footage has been deleted
and get back to you.

00:14:04.750 --> 00:14:05.750
Thank you.

00:14:07.050 --> 00:14:10.390
See? They'll check the dashcam footage
and get back to us.

00:14:10.490 --> 00:14:12.590
Yes, I have eyes.

00:14:13.920 --> 00:14:15.730
After all the trouble I've gone to,

00:14:16.090 --> 00:14:17.430
don't I get some kind of reward?

00:14:17.430 --> 00:14:18.430
Right.

00:14:19.060 --> 00:14:20.060
Thanks.

00:14:20.730 --> 00:14:23.400
Happy? I'll get going now.

00:14:23.800 --> 00:14:25.100
Oh, wait a second.

00:14:25.700 --> 00:14:28.640
I can't let a delicate woman like you
go home alone this late at night.

00:14:29.970 --> 00:14:32.280
Me? You think I'm delicate?

00:14:33.310 --> 00:14:34.310
No.

00:14:35.250 --> 00:14:39.820
Anyway, if something happened to you,
imagine how guilty I'd feel.

00:14:40.280 --> 00:14:42.490
The only reason I'm offering
to walk you home...

00:14:42.820 --> 00:14:46.760
is purely for my own peace of mind.
It's for me, not you.

00:14:47.420 --> 00:14:48.430
Come on, let's go.

00:14:50.560 --> 00:14:51.560
My gosh.

00:14:52.460 --> 00:14:53.460
Unbelievable.

00:15:04.810 --> 00:15:05.840
Goodess...

00:15:06.440 --> 00:15:07.480
Your legs...

00:15:14.920 --> 00:15:15.920
What?

00:15:23.790 --> 00:15:25.430
Hey, honey.

00:15:25.630 --> 00:15:27.930
Where are you? Why aren't you home yet?

00:15:32.600 --> 00:15:34.610
I'm actually out of town right now.

00:15:35.170 --> 00:15:36.740
All of a sudden? Why?

00:15:37.110 --> 00:15:39.580
It's for the Industrial Design Department
thesis exhibition.

00:15:40.280 --> 00:15:42.080
I ended up coming
with the department head.

00:15:42.550 --> 00:15:45.420
- We're in Gangwon Province.
- Really?

00:15:46.520 --> 00:15:48.150
So you're coming back tomorrow?

00:15:48.150 --> 00:15:50.620
Yes. Make sure you lock up tight.

00:15:52.020 --> 00:15:55.060
I'm exhausted from driving
and meetings all day.

00:15:55.730 --> 00:16:00.060
Okay, get some rest.
Don't push yourself too hard.

00:16:01.070 --> 00:16:02.300
Good night, honey.

00:16:03.030 --> 00:16:05.200
You too. Good night.

00:16:17.380 --> 00:16:20.250
(Suk Hee's Side Dishes)

00:16:21.120 --> 00:16:22.120
Hey.

00:16:22.790 --> 00:16:26.790
Tae Sook and Bo Ra made it here safely.
When are you coming?

00:16:28.160 --> 00:16:30.790
What? You and Tae Sook got a divorce?

00:16:31.700 --> 00:16:32.730
There.

00:16:37.330 --> 00:16:38.340
Goodness.

00:16:46.180 --> 00:16:48.250
Tae Sook. I need to talk to you.

00:16:48.650 --> 00:16:51.250
Why, Dad? Hurry and eat your breakfast.

00:16:53.620 --> 00:16:54.990
Is something wrong, Dad?

00:16:55.320 --> 00:16:56.320
Come.

00:17:04.090 --> 00:17:05.100
What's going on?

00:17:17.540 --> 00:17:20.140
Dad, your food is going to get cold.

00:17:20.810 --> 00:17:22.050
Do you think soup is the issue now?

00:17:27.550 --> 00:17:29.020
Tae Sook, why are you here?

00:17:29.350 --> 00:17:31.820
I told you,
I'm just here for a little visit.

00:17:31.820 --> 00:17:33.690
I just got off the phone
with your husband.

00:17:35.190 --> 00:17:36.290
Why did you do it?

00:17:37.090 --> 00:17:38.860
Even though I was so against it,

00:17:38.860 --> 00:17:41.330
you stole Jang Mi's tuition money
and ran off.

00:17:41.530 --> 00:17:44.770
You swore you'd live with that punk
until the end of time, didn't you?

00:17:45.040 --> 00:17:47.040
If you were going to do that,
you should have made it work.

00:17:47.270 --> 00:17:49.670
No way. So she's back
because she got divorced.

00:17:52.140 --> 00:17:54.180
I'm finished eating.

00:17:55.580 --> 00:17:57.950
Bo Ra, let's go play in the other room.

00:17:57.950 --> 00:18:00.250
You should have made a better life!

00:18:00.550 --> 00:18:02.420
So why on earth did you get a divorce?

00:18:02.620 --> 00:18:04.460
He cheated on me with some other woman.

00:18:04.460 --> 00:18:05.490
It wasn't just an affair.

00:18:05.490 --> 00:18:07.460
He basically started a new life with her.
What was I supposed to do?

00:18:08.660 --> 00:18:09.660
My goodness.

00:18:12.330 --> 00:18:14.730
So that's why Dad
didn't come home last night?

00:18:15.000 --> 00:18:16.130
That's right.

00:18:16.800 --> 00:18:19.170
It must be so hard on your dad at his age.

00:18:19.170 --> 00:18:21.940
That department head is younger than him,
and he has to suck up to him.

00:18:21.940 --> 00:18:23.610
He must be a total wreck.

00:18:23.670 --> 00:18:25.880
But Dad chose
not to be the department head...

00:18:25.880 --> 00:18:27.340
because it was a hassle, remember?

00:18:28.110 --> 00:18:29.150
That's true.

00:18:30.610 --> 00:18:31.880
This won't do.

00:18:31.880 --> 00:18:34.690
I'll get some herbal medicine
for your dad and Jun Ho.

00:18:34.750 --> 00:18:35.750
That expensive stuff?

00:18:36.120 --> 00:18:38.820
I have to get a prescription for it today.
I really do.

00:18:40.060 --> 00:18:43.690
It must be exhausting for you too,
working so late every night.

00:18:44.460 --> 00:18:46.430
No, I'm fine, really.

00:18:47.160 --> 00:18:48.400
I should get going.

00:18:53.100 --> 00:18:54.770
Mom, what about me?

00:18:55.540 --> 00:18:58.510
- What about you?
- I work hard too, you know.

00:18:58.880 --> 00:19:00.780
Jun Ho gets some, but I don't?

00:19:01.040 --> 00:19:04.150
A big, healthy guy like you
doesn't need that stuff.

00:19:04.410 --> 00:19:06.820
You have too much energy as it is.

00:19:07.020 --> 00:19:08.220
You don't need it, so forget it.

00:19:08.990 --> 00:19:11.420
Favoritism with food is the cruelest thing
you can do.

00:19:11.690 --> 00:19:13.360
So you're giving it to him and not me?

00:19:13.360 --> 00:19:15.860
You're healthy, so why do you need it?

00:19:16.230 --> 00:19:17.460
Fine.

00:19:17.460 --> 00:19:19.960
- I'll steal some of his then.
- For goodness' sake.

00:19:25.400 --> 00:19:28.740
Are you telling me even you don't know
where CEO Chae is, Manager Lee?

00:19:30.010 --> 00:19:31.070
I apologize, sir.

00:19:32.280 --> 00:19:34.310
Then does that mean CEO Chae...

00:19:34.680 --> 00:19:36.450
didn't come home last night,

00:19:36.450 --> 00:19:38.220
and no one knows where she was?

00:19:39.280 --> 00:19:43.250
If Seo Rin and CEO Chae don't come home,

00:19:43.590 --> 00:19:45.860
what are we supposed to do
in this huge, empty house?

00:19:46.360 --> 00:19:47.720
Just be quiet.

00:19:47.990 --> 00:19:49.360
Yes.

00:19:49.890 --> 00:19:50.930
Chairman.

00:19:51.190 --> 00:19:53.060
Your herbal tonic is ready.
It's nice and strong.

00:19:53.130 --> 00:19:54.630
Give it here. I'll drink it.

00:19:54.670 --> 00:19:55.830
Yes.

00:19:59.000 --> 00:20:00.000
Oh my.

00:20:00.600 --> 00:20:02.270
Look who just showed up.

00:20:03.440 --> 00:20:05.240
- Father.
- Hwa Young.

00:20:05.510 --> 00:20:07.080
Where did you sleep last night?

00:20:07.780 --> 00:20:12.150
No matter how upset you are with us,
you should still sleep at home.

00:20:12.220 --> 00:20:14.350
With your father-in-law in the house,

00:20:14.420 --> 00:20:16.250
how could you just spend the night out
like that?

00:20:16.950 --> 00:20:20.120
- The Chairman was so worried about you.
- I'm sorry, Father.

00:20:20.290 --> 00:20:23.230
It's unacceptable for the hotel's owner
to be unreachable.

00:20:23.930 --> 00:20:25.830
Does it make any sense
that even Manager Lee...

00:20:25.830 --> 00:20:26.860
didn't know where you were?

00:20:29.130 --> 00:20:30.630
So where on earth did you sleep?

00:20:30.630 --> 00:20:32.770
I suppose she was working all night.

00:20:33.300 --> 00:20:34.300
Right?

00:20:34.970 --> 00:20:36.770
That's enough of your little protest.

00:20:37.470 --> 00:20:39.940
Go get Seo Rin and bring her home.

00:20:41.610 --> 00:20:45.020
- Seo Rin?
- In a suite at the Dream Hotel,

00:20:45.550 --> 00:20:47.990
it seems she threw
some kind of wild, all-night party.

00:20:48.690 --> 00:20:50.850
And you, her mother, had no idea?

00:20:53.120 --> 00:20:54.790
Can you imagine how upset she must be
to act out like that?

00:21:06.200 --> 00:21:08.310
I've come so far,
and not one step was easy.

00:21:08.940 --> 00:21:10.770
After everything I've been through
to get here...

00:21:12.010 --> 00:21:16.450
Just because a few insects are stirring,
do you think I'm going to bat an eye?

00:21:21.150 --> 00:21:22.150
Where did you...

00:21:23.720 --> 00:21:25.290
sleep last night?

00:21:27.260 --> 00:21:28.760
And what business is that of yours?

00:21:30.630 --> 00:21:32.200
This is a critical time.

00:21:32.400 --> 00:21:33.760
You can't be seen with another man...

00:21:34.560 --> 00:21:35.570
Shut up.

00:21:36.500 --> 00:21:39.800
If you ever say something like that again,
we're done. Understand?

00:21:40.440 --> 00:21:42.370
I told you not to cross the line,
didn't I?

00:21:48.150 --> 00:21:51.010
(Suk Hee's Side Dishes)

00:21:53.580 --> 00:21:55.220
That's amazing.

00:21:55.820 --> 00:21:59.520
Mom, even a master chef
couldn't beat your knife skills.

00:22:02.360 --> 00:22:04.260
Are you planning to see CEO Chae today...

00:22:04.560 --> 00:22:07.300
to give her a new lunch box
and side dishes?

00:22:08.300 --> 00:22:10.470
She helped Tae Pyung out a lot.

00:22:10.600 --> 00:22:12.540
It's not nearly enough
to repay her, though.

00:22:13.840 --> 00:22:15.040
Tae Pyung, let's go.

00:22:15.210 --> 00:22:17.210
Are you heading to the Dream Hotel now?

00:22:17.210 --> 00:22:19.280
- Yes.
- Then let me give you a ride.

00:22:19.680 --> 00:22:21.710
If you go alone,
you might not get in like last time.

00:22:21.810 --> 00:22:24.380
That's a good point.
Jang Mi, we should go with Lawyer Kang.

00:22:44.270 --> 00:22:46.270
(CEO Chae Hwa Young)

00:23:00.550 --> 00:23:02.050
Why haven't I heard anything yet?

00:23:04.250 --> 00:23:05.260
Ha Neul.

00:23:06.360 --> 00:23:07.560
Where are you?

00:23:08.360 --> 00:23:09.360
Where...

00:23:17.070 --> 00:23:18.140
It's me.

00:23:18.840 --> 00:23:21.710
- Why haven't I heard from you yet?
- Yes, Ma'am.

00:23:22.070 --> 00:23:23.840
We're looking everywhere
and trying everything,

00:23:24.140 --> 00:23:25.310
but we're running into some difficulties.

00:23:25.680 --> 00:23:26.910
The same excuse again?

00:23:27.740 --> 00:23:30.650
After all the money I've given you,
that's all you have to say?

00:23:31.650 --> 00:23:33.880
Are you even looking for my son?

00:23:33.880 --> 00:23:35.020
Of course.

00:23:35.590 --> 00:23:39.890
It seems the boy you're looking for
was moved from orphanage to orphanage.

00:23:40.020 --> 00:23:41.560
So the trail has gone cold.

00:23:42.130 --> 00:23:43.430
Please, just give us a little more time.

00:24:01.080 --> 00:24:04.180
I bet CEO Chae eats fancy meals every day.

00:24:04.610 --> 00:24:06.120
I wonder if this lunch box
will be good enough.

00:24:06.180 --> 00:24:09.720
Once she tastes it, she'll be blown away.
Don't worry about a thing.

00:24:09.990 --> 00:24:11.720
You're looking at living proof right here.

00:24:13.090 --> 00:24:15.630
I should call and see if CEO Chae is in.

00:24:19.800 --> 00:24:21.300
You have to find my Ha Neul.

00:24:21.870 --> 00:24:24.730
I'm running out of time.
You need to find him immediately.

00:24:26.070 --> 00:24:29.210
Go through everything again,
with a fine-toothed comb.

00:24:30.010 --> 00:24:31.140
As long as you find him,

00:24:31.680 --> 00:24:34.810
I'll pay you whatever it takes.
Understand?

00:24:35.680 --> 00:24:36.680
I mean it.

00:24:42.290 --> 00:24:44.650
I need someone on my side.

00:24:44.790 --> 00:24:45.920
My own flesh and blood.

00:24:47.060 --> 00:24:48.360
It has to be my son.

00:24:48.930 --> 00:24:50.890
He's the only one I can trust
to be on my side.

00:24:58.900 --> 00:25:00.170
That looks heavy. Here, let me take it.

00:25:00.740 --> 00:25:02.710
You'll have to make a lunch box like this
for me someday.

00:25:04.670 --> 00:25:05.680
Okay.

00:25:19.690 --> 00:25:20.720
Yes.

00:25:27.130 --> 00:25:29.130
(CEO Chae Hwa Young)

00:25:31.740 --> 00:25:35.940
CEO Chae,
my sister and I brought you a lunch box.

00:25:36.070 --> 00:25:38.740
- Are you in your office now?
- What?

00:25:39.110 --> 00:25:41.650
His sister? Oh Jang Mi?

00:25:43.110 --> 00:25:45.820
She's coming here now?
No. This can't be happening.

00:25:46.420 --> 00:25:47.850
If the Chairman or Seo Rin sees her...

00:26:33.530 --> 00:26:35.200
(The First Man)

00:26:35.730 --> 00:26:39.500
Stop her right now.
Don't let her run into anyone.

00:26:39.600 --> 00:26:41.910
Is CEO Chae in her office today?

00:26:42.210 --> 00:26:44.410
I saw someone who looks
exactly like you, Jang Mi.

00:26:44.410 --> 00:26:45.880
She looked exactly like you.

00:26:45.980 --> 00:26:47.080
Like an identical twin.

00:26:47.140 --> 00:26:49.750
If you think I'm pretty, just say so.

00:26:50.180 --> 00:26:51.310
Did you see Oh Jang Mi?

00:26:51.650 --> 00:26:53.450
It looks like she already went up
to your office.

00:26:53.880 --> 00:26:54.920
Is CEO Chae...

00:26:55.850 --> 00:26:56.920
in her office?

00:27:02.260 --> 00:27:04.230
