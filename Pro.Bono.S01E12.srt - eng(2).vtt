WEBVTT

00:00:33.054 --> 00:00:36.057
PRO BONO

00:00:39.144 --> 00:00:41.396
ONE WEEK BEFORE THE FIRST HEARING

00:00:41.479 --> 00:00:44.691
You're saying we should expose
Shin Jung-seok and Oh Gyu-jang right away?

00:00:45.775 --> 00:00:47.777
Are you going to be all right?

00:00:47.861 --> 00:00:48.987
If you mess with them,

00:00:49.070 --> 00:00:51.155
you might not be able to work
as an attorney again.

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:52.699
-Are you scared?
-Scared?

00:00:52.782 --> 00:00:54.576
-Says who?
-Mr. Kang.

00:00:54.659 --> 00:00:57.745
Why don't we work our way up step by step?

00:00:57.829 --> 00:01:02.167
As you know, they're the ones with power
who run the entire legal world.

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:06.212
No. Actually, they run the entire country.

00:01:07.005 --> 00:01:10.008
This trial isn't like any other.

00:01:12.969 --> 00:01:15.638
Geez, Dr. Oh. Let's take a break!

00:01:15.722 --> 00:01:16.639
Gosh.

00:01:21.728 --> 00:01:22.562
Goodness.

00:01:25.356 --> 00:01:26.191
Gosh, Dr. Oh!

00:01:26.274 --> 00:01:27.984
KIM HO-JIN
FORMER NEWSPAPER EDITOR-IN-CHIEF

00:01:28.067 --> 00:01:30.236
You're so fit
since you work out every day.

00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:33.364
I just can't keep up with you.

00:01:33.448 --> 00:01:37.076
I guess I haven't been treating
our firm's advisors well.

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:39.954
You're all out of energy.

00:01:40.663 --> 00:01:41.789
Geez, don't say that.

00:01:41.873 --> 00:01:44.918
After leaving our former jobs,
we all get to stay nice and warm

00:01:45.001 --> 00:01:49.255
at Oh & Partners
thanks to you, Dr. Oh.

00:01:49.339 --> 00:01:50.590
FORMER JUSTICE BYEON JUNG-HEON

00:01:50.673 --> 00:01:52.634
Don't worry about Kang Da-wit's trial.

00:01:52.717 --> 00:01:55.220
It'll be assigned to a judge

00:01:55.303 --> 00:01:58.723
who will conduct it quietly and smoothly.

00:01:58.806 --> 00:02:00.099
Goodness. Thank you,

00:02:00.725 --> 00:02:03.394
Mr. Kim and Justice Byeon.

00:02:03.978 --> 00:02:08.149
I'll also make sure to block
any strange articles from coming out.

00:02:10.693 --> 00:02:14.030
Geez. You're the youngest
and yet you're so out of shape.

00:02:14.113 --> 00:02:15.657
Gosh, I'm going to keel over.

00:02:17.325 --> 00:02:21.704
Mr. Park, you're handling things
on the prosecution side, right?

00:02:21.788 --> 00:02:23.456
FORMER PROSECUTOR GENERAL PARK SEUNG-GYU

00:02:23.539 --> 00:02:26.084
Of course. Dr. Oh, please rest assured.

00:02:26.167 --> 00:02:27.835
My goodness.

00:02:28.836 --> 00:02:30.797
I feel so relieved thanks to you all.

00:02:31.547 --> 00:02:33.049
By the way, Dr. Oh.

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:36.094
Minister Yoon's stepping down
during the reshuffle,

00:02:36.177 --> 00:02:38.930
and he begged me
to get him a spot as an advisor.

00:02:39.013 --> 00:02:41.140
Could you give it some consideration?

00:02:41.224 --> 00:02:43.101
He's worked only as a public servant,

00:02:43.184 --> 00:02:45.812
so he can't even afford
to pay for his kids' weddings.

00:02:47.730 --> 00:02:48.606
Is that so?

00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:51.943
He's someone you rarely see these days.
A clean and honest public official.

00:02:54.988 --> 00:02:56.614
Okay, let's get back to running.

00:02:57.240 --> 00:02:58.408
Sorry?

00:02:58.491 --> 00:02:59.325
Gosh, Dr. Oh!

00:03:00.368 --> 00:03:02.495
We haven't even sat for five minutes!

00:03:02.578 --> 00:03:04.539
The number
of former high-ranking officials

00:03:04.622 --> 00:03:06.207
serving as Oh & Partners advisors

00:03:06.290 --> 00:03:08.835
far exceeds the number of officials
in the whole government.

00:03:08.918 --> 00:03:11.713
If we use standard tactics
and go step by step,

00:03:12.380 --> 00:03:13.464
we can't beat them.

00:03:14.590 --> 00:03:16.676
So, what are you suggesting we do?

00:03:17.343 --> 00:03:19.554
We should at least throw
a bomb at the stage.

00:03:20.179 --> 00:03:21.931
-Sorry?
-Remember the bombshell

00:03:22.015 --> 00:03:24.892
that we wanted to drop at the end?

00:03:26.394 --> 00:03:28.187
Let's drop it at the first hearing.

00:03:30.314 --> 00:03:31.315
What?

00:03:32.942 --> 00:03:34.986
We also request
the mastermind behind all of this…

00:03:35.069 --> 00:03:36.571
THE PRESENT, CIVIL PANEL COURT

00:03:36.654 --> 00:03:38.072
the founder of Oh & Partners,

00:03:38.156 --> 00:03:41.284
Dr. Oh Gyu-jang,

00:03:41.367 --> 00:03:44.454
as another witness.

00:03:56.966 --> 00:03:58.051
Your Honor!

00:03:58.676 --> 00:04:00.428
He is requesting unnecessary witnesses

00:04:00.511 --> 00:04:04.140
to stand before the court
with malicious intent. Your Honor--

00:04:04.223 --> 00:04:05.683
Will you stop? Don't interfere.

00:04:06.267 --> 00:04:07.143
Your Honor!

00:04:07.769 --> 00:04:09.937
You must dismiss this request.

00:04:10.021 --> 00:04:12.273
-Your Honor!
-Order in the court!

00:04:14.442 --> 00:04:17.320
Are you sure this witness request
is relevant to the case?

00:04:17.403 --> 00:04:19.238
Of course, Your Honor.

00:04:19.322 --> 00:04:23.284
If you deem it necessary, may I disclose
the supporting evidence at this court?

00:04:23.951 --> 00:04:24.869
Yes, by all means.

00:04:25.912 --> 00:04:27.038
Hold on.

00:04:27.121 --> 00:04:28.122
What is it?

00:04:35.880 --> 00:04:36.881
Justice Shin,

00:04:37.590 --> 00:04:40.885
did you get the research analyst's review
of Chairman Jang's case?

00:04:40.968 --> 00:04:42.053
Not yet, sir.

00:04:42.887 --> 00:04:45.181
Young judges these days
lack a sense of duty.

00:04:45.932 --> 00:04:48.851
Why are they dragging their feet
on such a clear case?

00:04:48.935 --> 00:04:52.230
I'll tell them again. Don't worry, sir.

00:04:52.939 --> 00:04:54.190
That fellow, Chairman Jang.

00:04:55.108 --> 00:04:58.444
We need him for our suffering economy.

00:04:59.070 --> 00:05:02.281
Make sure a wise conclusion is reached.

00:05:02.365 --> 00:05:05.243
We're in the same boat anyway, right?

00:05:09.497 --> 00:05:10.706
Your Honor?

00:05:10.790 --> 00:05:12.750
-Your Honor.
-Yes?

00:05:12.834 --> 00:05:14.544
Right. Excuse me.

00:05:14.627 --> 00:05:17.338
Go ahead, Plaintiff's defendant.
I mean, Plaintiff's counsel.

00:05:17.422 --> 00:05:20.842
It is a crime to secretly record
another person's phone call.

00:05:20.925 --> 00:05:23.636
And unauthorized recordings
cannot be used as evidence in court.

00:05:23.719 --> 00:05:25.805
You know this very well, Your Honor.

00:05:25.888 --> 00:05:29.517
For violating the Protection
of Communications Secrets Act,

00:05:29.600 --> 00:05:31.352
we will report the defendant immediately.

00:05:31.436 --> 00:05:34.564
Yes, he is correct. If you secretly record
another person's phone call,

00:05:34.647 --> 00:05:36.149
it is not admissible as evidence.

00:05:36.232 --> 00:05:37.525
However,

00:05:38.109 --> 00:05:39.569
this recording

00:05:39.652 --> 00:05:41.112
does not end here.

00:05:44.699 --> 00:05:48.578
-We're in the same boat anyway, right?
-Father, the meeting's about to begin.

00:05:48.661 --> 00:05:52.832
I see. Okay. We'll talk again later then.

00:05:52.915 --> 00:05:56.627
There were more
than two people on this call.

00:05:56.711 --> 00:05:59.881
It was a group call with three people.

00:05:59.964 --> 00:06:02.049
The person who called Dr. Oh "Father"

00:06:02.133 --> 00:06:03.885
is Oh Jung-in,

00:06:05.761 --> 00:06:08.389
the former CEO and managing partner
of Oh & Partners.

00:06:12.685 --> 00:06:14.562
Plaintiff's counsel
knows perfectly well too.

00:06:14.645 --> 00:06:17.481
Even if one person didn't say anything

00:06:17.565 --> 00:06:19.650
and was just listening,

00:06:20.526 --> 00:06:22.653
as long as they were a part of the call,

00:06:22.737 --> 00:06:26.240
the recording is admissible as evidence.

00:06:26.324 --> 00:06:29.911
This call was recorded by Ms. Oh.

00:06:32.872 --> 00:06:34.165
Why did Jung-in…

00:06:35.541 --> 00:06:38.336
Ms. Oh, I'll put you on a three-way call.

00:06:41.631 --> 00:06:42.965
ON A CALL
RECORDING

00:06:43.049 --> 00:06:45.593
Make sure a wise conclusion is reached.

00:06:45.676 --> 00:06:48.638
We're in the same boat anyway, right?

00:06:51.265 --> 00:06:52.892
Father, the meeting's about to begin.

00:06:52.975 --> 00:06:55.102
I see. Okay.

00:06:57.230 --> 00:06:58.773
We'll talk again later then.

00:07:02.985 --> 00:07:03.861
Your Honor,

00:07:03.945 --> 00:07:07.406
will that be enough to explain

00:07:07.490 --> 00:07:11.160
why we need these requested witnesses?

00:07:13.120 --> 00:07:14.789
Well, this is no ordinary matter.

00:07:15.456 --> 00:07:16.916
It sure isn't.

00:07:18.459 --> 00:07:21.128
Well, then. We will review this thoroughly

00:07:21.212 --> 00:07:24.924
and make a careful decision.

00:07:26.133 --> 00:07:29.262
You might want to hurry
with the review, Your Honor.

00:07:29.345 --> 00:07:30.555
It just so happens to be

00:07:30.638 --> 00:07:32.765
right before the deadline
for evening newspapers,

00:07:32.848 --> 00:07:36.477
so the articles will start pouring in.

00:07:43.484 --> 00:07:44.694
I thought it was okay.

00:07:51.951 --> 00:07:53.661
WITNESSES ON HOLD
DUE TO OUTSIDE INFLUENCE?

00:07:53.744 --> 00:07:55.329
IS OH & PARTNERS A LOBBYIST GROUP?

00:07:55.913 --> 00:07:57.456
FINAL EPISODE

00:07:57.540 --> 00:07:59.166
I can't believe the Court did this.

00:07:59.250 --> 00:08:00.543
Oh & Partners were…

00:08:01.127 --> 00:08:03.754
-That bombshell blew up big.
-Indeed.

00:08:04.380 --> 00:08:06.924
In this digital age,
I doubted evening papers would matter.

00:08:07.008 --> 00:08:08.884
But you did it again!

00:08:08.968 --> 00:08:11.887
It's still the best way to get
people's attention as they get off work.

00:08:11.971 --> 00:08:13.139
You did it again!

00:08:13.222 --> 00:08:14.515
And that's not the only thing.

00:08:14.599 --> 00:08:15.474
-What?
-Pardon?

00:08:15.558 --> 00:08:16.809
All the editors-in-chief

00:08:16.892 --> 00:08:19.312
of the major newspapers
serve as Oh & Partners advisors.

00:08:19.395 --> 00:08:21.939
But all the major newspapers
publish in the morning.

00:08:22.565 --> 00:08:23.441
Sharp as always.

00:08:24.025 --> 00:08:26.027
They had no time to intervene at all.

00:08:26.902 --> 00:08:30.406
Online articles are pouring in too.

00:08:30.489 --> 00:08:33.993
We've stirred up the hornet's nest,
so they can't ignore us.

00:08:34.076 --> 00:08:34.910
Now,

00:08:37.038 --> 00:08:38.372
we'll have a proper fight.

00:08:38.914 --> 00:08:41.959
But is Ms. Oh really okay?

00:08:42.627 --> 00:08:43.502
I know, right?

00:08:51.177 --> 00:08:53.262
The call wasn't connected at that moment.

00:08:53.346 --> 00:08:56.932
Dr. Oh, Ms. Oh said it was urgent,
so I've put her through momentarily.

00:08:58.601 --> 00:09:01.854
After making it
a three-way call from the start,

00:09:01.937 --> 00:09:03.105
were you listening in?

00:09:04.065 --> 00:09:05.691
To make admissible evidence?

00:09:07.151 --> 00:09:09.236
SUPREME COURT

00:09:09.320 --> 00:09:11.447
The storm will pass
if you wait a little bit.

00:09:12.031 --> 00:09:13.574
You have to stay resilient.

00:09:14.367 --> 00:09:16.077
We can't allow the judiciary to be shaken.

00:09:16.160 --> 00:09:17.161
Justice Shin,

00:09:19.080 --> 00:09:21.165
given the current situation,

00:09:21.248 --> 00:09:24.502
it may be inappropriate
to have this conversation.

00:09:24.585 --> 00:09:26.379
-I'm sorry.
-Judge Kim!

00:09:34.845 --> 00:09:38.349
Connect me to the senior chief judge
of Seoul Central District Court.

00:09:54.156 --> 00:09:56.617
Are you okay
about disclosing the recording?

00:09:58.411 --> 00:10:00.162
Trying to comfort me
after causing the pain?

00:10:00.871 --> 00:10:02.289
You cornered me into doing it.

00:10:05.042 --> 00:10:08.838
Just how much do you know
about the trap I fell into?

00:10:12.675 --> 00:10:13.884
Da-wit.

00:10:15.428 --> 00:10:17.555
What on earth are you talking about?

00:10:18.723 --> 00:10:20.808
I'm not a fool, Jung-in.

00:10:20.891 --> 00:10:22.476
I didn't trust you from the start.

00:10:22.560 --> 00:10:24.562
Things just didn't add up though.

00:10:24.645 --> 00:10:26.397
If you were an accomplice,

00:10:26.480 --> 00:10:28.482
you had no reason
to bring me into Oh & Partners.

00:10:28.566 --> 00:10:31.277
Your father even refused
to register me as an attorney.

00:10:31.360 --> 00:10:34.447
Was it because you couldn't move on
from our puppy love at the JRTI?

00:10:34.530 --> 00:10:36.991
Come on.
You're not the type to do that, Jung-in.

00:10:37.658 --> 00:10:39.994
So, that left me with only one thing.

00:10:42.371 --> 00:10:43.789
You needed me

00:10:44.415 --> 00:10:46.292
to become
your father's weakness to exploit.

00:10:48.169 --> 00:10:51.547
When we first met,
you said you needed my help.

00:10:54.049 --> 00:10:55.426
Was this what you meant?

00:11:08.606 --> 00:11:10.357
You're right about everything.

00:11:17.865 --> 00:11:20.117
I'm not going to apologize.

00:11:20.826 --> 00:11:23.204
It would be meaningless to do so now.

00:11:49.230 --> 00:11:51.690
It won't be easy
to go up against my father.

00:11:51.774 --> 00:11:55.611
If you want to beat him,
look into the truths he has.

00:11:55.694 --> 00:11:57.238
His truths?

00:11:59.532 --> 00:12:01.867
My father once said

00:12:02.493 --> 00:12:05.246
that the best way to hide something

00:12:06.705 --> 00:12:08.582
is to hide it within the truths.

00:12:10.042 --> 00:12:14.463
If there's one lie among 99 truths,

00:12:14.547 --> 00:12:16.423
people can't tell which is which.

00:12:19.468 --> 00:12:22.179
What my father says is mostly true.

00:12:22.972 --> 00:12:26.559
Search through those truths
and find out what he's hiding.

00:12:35.609 --> 00:12:38.237
-Hi, Ms. Park.
-We have a problem, Mr. Kang!

00:12:38.320 --> 00:12:39.780
What? What happened?

00:12:39.863 --> 00:12:41.323
The trial was suddenly reassigned

00:12:41.407 --> 00:12:44.827
to a new senior chief judge
who's close with Justice Shin.

00:12:46.370 --> 00:12:48.247
Wait, what are you talking about?

00:12:51.458 --> 00:12:53.210
SEOUL CENTRAL DISTRICT COURT

00:12:53.294 --> 00:12:55.004
CIVIL PANEL COURT FOR DAMAGES

00:13:01.677 --> 00:13:04.888
What was the reason
for reassignment, Your Honor?

00:13:04.972 --> 00:13:05.806
Right.

00:13:05.889 --> 00:13:07.182
SENIOR CHIEF JUDGE KIM SEONG-HUN

00:13:07.266 --> 00:13:09.643
As this is an important case
of great public interest,

00:13:09.727 --> 00:13:13.063
it was reassigned to our senior panel
for careful evaluation.

00:13:13.731 --> 00:13:16.775
It's unprecedented to reassign a trial
while in the middle of it.

00:13:16.859 --> 00:13:19.570
The Court was about to rule
on the approval of witnesses!

00:13:21.322 --> 00:13:24.575
Wasn't it extremely unprecedented
to request a sitting justice

00:13:24.658 --> 00:13:26.785
as a witness anyway?

00:13:28.287 --> 00:13:29.747
Plaintiff's counsel.

00:13:29.830 --> 00:13:32.333
Do you have any comments
on the request for witnesses?

00:13:33.584 --> 00:13:36.086
Yes, Your Honor.

00:13:36.170 --> 00:13:40.758
The defendant keeps talking
about manipulated trials.

00:13:40.841 --> 00:13:42.843
It is totally baseless.

00:13:42.926 --> 00:13:45.054
Where does it mention that
in the recording?

00:13:45.137 --> 00:13:47.723
A presiding justice
and the owner of a law firm

00:13:47.806 --> 00:13:50.267
discussed how to handle a specific case.

00:13:50.351 --> 00:13:51.852
Discussed?

00:13:52.728 --> 00:13:56.815
Neither Dr. Oh nor Oh & Partners
represent Chairman Jang Hyeon-bae.

00:13:56.899 --> 00:13:59.318
Don't tell me
you didn't check that either.

00:13:59.401 --> 00:14:02.988
He's known for working in the shadows
without an official appointment.

00:14:03.072 --> 00:14:05.783
Stop making baseless accusations.

00:14:06.408 --> 00:14:09.411
The two are veteran legal professionals
and long-time friends.

00:14:09.995 --> 00:14:13.123
Since it was a case that would have
a big impact on the economy,

00:14:13.207 --> 00:14:15.376
they simply expressed
their personal opinions

00:14:15.459 --> 00:14:18.295
out of concern for the country
as elder statesmen.

00:14:18.379 --> 00:14:19.505
Is that so?

00:14:20.881 --> 00:14:23.967
We're in the same boat anyway, right?

00:14:26.553 --> 00:14:28.222
Which boat are they in?

00:14:28.305 --> 00:14:30.224
If a Supreme Court Justice

00:14:30.307 --> 00:14:33.519
and the founder of Korea's top law firm
are in that boat,

00:14:33.602 --> 00:14:35.854
I want to be onboard too.

00:14:36.981 --> 00:14:39.191
Do you happen to have a ticket?

00:14:41.026 --> 00:14:43.529
Please stop saying things like that.

00:14:44.863 --> 00:14:48.450
Aren't we all in the same boat
called the Republic of Korea?

00:14:49.535 --> 00:14:52.788
Are there sides when it comes
to worrying about our country?

00:14:52.871 --> 00:14:55.040
Come on, what kind of ridiculous
and misleading--

00:14:55.124 --> 00:14:58.919
Your Honor, the defendant's claim
of manipulating trials

00:14:59.003 --> 00:15:03.340
based on a few words from a vague,
abstract conversation is groundless.

00:15:03.424 --> 00:15:06.885
I kindly ask
for your wise judgment, Your Honor.

00:15:16.145 --> 00:15:17.688
Okay, the Court shall give its ruling.

00:15:17.771 --> 00:15:20.357
The defendant's request for witnesses

00:15:20.441 --> 00:15:22.443
lacks the justification for its necessity.

00:15:23.027 --> 00:15:24.778
-Thus, the motion is denied.
-Your Honor!

00:15:24.862 --> 00:15:27.364
If there is nothing more
to submit as new evidence,

00:15:27.448 --> 00:15:29.658
I'll assume you have
no other statements to make,

00:15:29.742 --> 00:15:31.326
and we will close arguments.

00:15:31.410 --> 00:15:33.370
All right, the verdict will be delivered--

00:15:33.454 --> 00:15:34.288
Your Honor.

00:15:37.666 --> 00:15:40.252
Yes, is there anything further, Mr. Kang?

00:15:41.086 --> 00:15:43.213
Yes, to uncover the truth,

00:15:43.297 --> 00:15:45.591
we request the accomplices
face one another

00:15:45.674 --> 00:15:47.176
in a confrontation cross-examination.

00:15:49.553 --> 00:15:51.346
A confrontation cross-examination?

00:15:51.430 --> 00:15:53.515
Who will be confronting each other?

00:15:53.599 --> 00:15:56.643
We request
a confrontation cross-examination

00:15:56.727 --> 00:15:59.813
with Jang Hyeon-bae,
Shin Jung-seok, and Oh Gyu-jang.

00:16:00.481 --> 00:16:02.816
Your Honor,
the plaintiff has already been examined.

00:16:02.900 --> 00:16:05.360
And you've dismissed the motion
to summon them as witnesses.

00:16:05.444 --> 00:16:08.072
How on earth
can he request this again?

00:16:08.155 --> 00:16:10.282
There's no way
they will stand before the court now.

00:16:10.365 --> 00:16:13.160
That's not true.
They will absolutely appear.

00:16:13.243 --> 00:16:14.828
-What?
-Your Honor.

00:16:15.788 --> 00:16:17.122
Please grant me one week.

00:16:17.748 --> 00:16:20.959
If they do not indicate
they will appear in court within a week,

00:16:21.043 --> 00:16:25.672
you can dismiss the motion for witnesses
and close the trial immediately.

00:16:29.009 --> 00:16:30.219
Did you say one week?

00:16:30.302 --> 00:16:32.554
Yes, Your Honor.

00:16:42.356 --> 00:16:43.982
NEW SENIOR CHIEF JUDGE
TRIAL REASSIGNED

00:16:44.066 --> 00:16:45.526
JANG, OH, SHIN
RECORDING REVEALED

00:16:46.693 --> 00:16:48.112
Mr. Kang.

00:16:48.612 --> 00:16:51.198
Is this really going to be all right?

00:16:51.782 --> 00:16:53.242
If things go sideways, we'll…

00:16:53.325 --> 00:16:55.661
Can we do this
as pro bono attorneys though?

00:16:56.245 --> 00:17:00.082
We have to shake things up
to create an opportunity.

00:17:00.165 --> 00:17:01.875
Through ordinary approaches,

00:17:01.959 --> 00:17:05.003
it'll be impossible
to bring them to court.

00:17:05.087 --> 00:17:06.463
Geez.

00:17:06.547 --> 00:17:09.466
I was taught all citizens
were equal before the law.

00:17:09.550 --> 00:17:11.635
All citizens look
equally foolish before the law

00:17:11.718 --> 00:17:14.763
in the eyes of those
sitting above the law.

00:17:14.847 --> 00:17:16.098
Mr. Kang.

00:17:16.682 --> 00:17:19.059
Don't you think
we're crossing way over the line?

00:17:19.560 --> 00:17:21.353
To face those people above the law,

00:17:21.436 --> 00:17:24.064
we may have to use means
outside the law.

00:17:24.148 --> 00:17:25.899
We still have a chance.

00:17:25.983 --> 00:17:28.986
Normally, they're people
who can't be shaken.

00:17:29.611 --> 00:17:31.071
But right now,

00:17:31.822 --> 00:17:33.532
they have one weak link.

00:17:34.116 --> 00:17:36.577
Yes, that's right.

00:17:37.161 --> 00:17:41.623
Right. It's hard to think rationally
when you're cornered.

00:17:41.707 --> 00:17:45.460
There's a way
to increase our chance of winning too.

00:17:46.920 --> 00:17:49.464
You just have to use
your persuasive ability

00:17:49.548 --> 00:17:50.966
like when you brought me in.

00:17:51.592 --> 00:17:52.634
My persuasive ability?

00:18:04.104 --> 00:18:05.189
Really?

00:18:40.307 --> 00:18:42.768
I'm not going to go down like this.

00:18:42.851 --> 00:18:44.478
Who do you think I am?

00:18:47.856 --> 00:18:48.982
MESSAGE

00:18:53.695 --> 00:18:56.240
Kang, I'm sorry,

00:18:56.323 --> 00:19:00.035
but it was all that fool
Jang Hyeon-bae's doing!

00:19:00.118 --> 00:19:03.080
I know it's late,
but I'll testify for you now.

00:19:03.163 --> 00:19:04.414
In return,

00:19:04.498 --> 00:19:06.708
-don't reveal any more of the recording.
-What is this?

00:19:06.792 --> 00:19:09.086
Have you lost your mind, Shin Jung-seok?

00:19:10.254 --> 00:19:11.922
I'm begging you.

00:19:13.924 --> 00:19:16.802
Judge Kang, please help me out.

00:19:17.427 --> 00:19:20.305
I'll have to serve time again.

00:19:20.806 --> 00:19:23.058
If you just help me,
I'll tell them everything!

00:19:23.558 --> 00:19:26.520
It was all that fool
Shin Jung-seok's doing!

00:19:27.187 --> 00:19:28.730
He used me while I was in prison.

00:19:28.814 --> 00:19:33.360
I'll support you in every way,
so please spare me, Judge Kang!

00:19:33.902 --> 00:19:35.779
That rotten bastard.

00:19:40.617 --> 00:19:43.328
I knew you were multi-talented, Mr. Jang,

00:19:43.412 --> 00:19:45.706
but how is this possible?

00:19:45.789 --> 00:19:48.709
AI technology has improved
tremendously lately.

00:19:48.792 --> 00:19:50.043
It's crazy.

00:19:50.752 --> 00:19:51.753
I was surprised too.

00:19:51.837 --> 00:19:52.838
He put so much effort

00:19:52.921 --> 00:19:56.383
to make that apple box video
to screw me over.

00:19:57.217 --> 00:19:58.844
Serves you right.

00:19:58.927 --> 00:20:00.929
Those jerks are so behind the times.

00:20:01.888 --> 00:20:03.890
But will this really
make them show up in court?

00:20:04.474 --> 00:20:07.811
Right? If they hold out,
the trial will be over.

00:20:07.894 --> 00:20:09.688
-Yeah.
-They'll have no choice but to come.

00:20:09.771 --> 00:20:10.689
Sorry?

00:20:10.772 --> 00:20:12.524
Why would they?

00:20:13.650 --> 00:20:15.110
Because they don't trust each other?

00:20:17.112 --> 00:20:20.282
You've created a type
of prisoner's dilemma, Mr. Kang.

00:20:20.365 --> 00:20:22.784
WHEN BOTH CONFESS OUT OF DISTRUST
AND GET HARSHER PUNISHMENT

00:20:22.868 --> 00:20:26.872
The best for those two is to resist
to the end and not come to court.

00:20:26.955 --> 00:20:29.583
But they don't know
what the other will say in court,

00:20:29.666 --> 00:20:31.710
so they have to come out of anxiety.

00:20:31.793 --> 00:20:35.047
If one person doesn't attend,
the other might pin everything on him.

00:20:36.506 --> 00:20:39.760
Geez, Mr. Kang has it all planned out!

00:20:41.720 --> 00:20:44.723
It mentions more recordings
that don't even exist,

00:20:44.806 --> 00:20:46.558
so they're probably soiling themselves.

00:20:46.641 --> 00:20:51.021
Also, those two aren't the type of people
who are likely to trust each other.

00:20:51.104 --> 00:20:52.773
What about Dr. Oh then?

00:20:53.357 --> 00:20:54.816
Did you send him a video too?

00:20:54.900 --> 00:20:56.234
No.

00:20:56.318 --> 00:20:59.029
He's not one to make a move
with something like this.

00:20:59.112 --> 00:21:00.155
Then what?

00:21:00.238 --> 00:21:02.157
We have to keep making variables.

00:21:03.325 --> 00:21:08.246
People like Dr. Oh hate
unexpected variables the most.

00:21:08.330 --> 00:21:11.708
A variable would be…

00:21:15.629 --> 00:21:17.798
I told you not to act rashly.

00:21:17.881 --> 00:21:21.843
That lousy video
doesn't even have a source, so ignore it.

00:21:23.387 --> 00:21:25.472
How can I trust that fool Jang Hyeon-bae?

00:21:25.555 --> 00:21:29.476
He must have sided with Kang Da-wit
because he's desperate to save himself.

00:21:31.103 --> 00:21:35.190
If Kang Da-wit really got
Jang Hyeon-bae to confess,

00:21:35.273 --> 00:21:37.401
why would he send you the video?

00:21:37.484 --> 00:21:41.863
What if Jang speaks nonsense
in court when I'm not there?

00:21:41.947 --> 00:21:44.699
Chairman Jang is ignoring my calls
and has gone into hiding.

00:21:45.325 --> 00:21:48.286
You can just sit it out.
Why are you so worried?

00:21:48.370 --> 00:21:51.706
How can a Supreme Court justice
be so faint-hearted?

00:21:55.961 --> 00:21:58.046
You have no right to say that, Dr. Oh.

00:21:59.047 --> 00:22:00.048
Right?

00:22:00.132 --> 00:22:02.259
Who failed to control his daughter
and caused this?

00:22:03.176 --> 00:22:05.095
-Watch what you say.
-Or…

00:22:05.178 --> 00:22:09.266
Rather than failing to control her,
is this also a part of your big picture?

00:22:09.349 --> 00:22:10.934
In order to have me in your control?

00:22:12.561 --> 00:22:14.062
Justice Shin.

00:22:14.146 --> 00:22:15.021
Dr. Oh…

00:22:16.940 --> 00:22:19.568
I'm not a pawn you can use
and discard in your chess game.

00:22:20.777 --> 00:22:21.820
Please excuse me.

00:22:35.584 --> 00:22:39.588
-Don't reveal any more of the recording.
-What do you think, Mr. Woo?

00:22:44.426 --> 00:22:45.886
It's suspicious.

00:22:47.053 --> 00:22:51.308
If it's real, why send this to you
instead of just showing it?

00:22:51.391 --> 00:22:54.311
There's a high chance
this was that fool Kang Da-wit's doing.

00:22:54.394 --> 00:22:57.189
Right? It's fishy, isn't it?

00:22:57.272 --> 00:22:58.398
But it's just…

00:23:00.734 --> 00:23:03.153
But what?

00:23:08.491 --> 00:23:10.243
There's just one thing

00:23:11.286 --> 00:23:12.954
that bothers me.

00:23:13.038 --> 00:23:15.415
And what is that?

00:23:19.044 --> 00:23:20.921
SENIOR CHIEF JUDGE KIM SEONG-HUN

00:23:23.673 --> 00:23:24.507
Hello?

00:23:25.091 --> 00:23:26.468
Hello, Justice Shin.

00:23:26.551 --> 00:23:29.095
Dr. Oh can't be trusted.

00:23:29.179 --> 00:23:30.472
What should I do?

00:23:30.555 --> 00:23:32.057
Don't worry about it, sir.

00:23:32.140 --> 00:23:35.352
I'll proactively intervene
if things don't go well.

00:23:35.435 --> 00:23:36.436
Okay.

00:23:52.327 --> 00:23:53.828
I thought you were bigger than this.

00:24:03.088 --> 00:24:04.798
Why did you do that?

00:24:07.217 --> 00:24:10.637
Why did you go that far
for someone like Chairman Jang?

00:24:12.222 --> 00:24:13.848
Was it for money?

00:24:16.309 --> 00:24:20.272
I'm not someone
desperately in need of money.

00:24:20.981 --> 00:24:21.982
Right.

00:24:23.358 --> 00:24:26.236
Well… Then, why?

00:24:26.319 --> 00:24:28.113
It was necessary.

00:24:28.780 --> 00:24:31.324
Necessary?

00:24:33.743 --> 00:24:35.036
Jang Hyeon-bae, that fellow…

00:24:35.704 --> 00:24:37.497
I know he's a scumbag.

00:24:38.748 --> 00:24:40.875
I want nothing to do with him.

00:24:41.418 --> 00:24:42.294
However,

00:24:42.836 --> 00:24:45.547
you need someone like that sometimes,

00:24:46.715 --> 00:24:49.718
because the world works
in complicated ways.

00:24:53.388 --> 00:24:55.223
I don't understand.

00:25:01.855 --> 00:25:03.315
Did you know they found

00:25:03.398 --> 00:25:07.861
a massive rare-earth deposit
in the Kingdom of Zaquir?

00:25:07.944 --> 00:25:10.864
Yes, it was all over the news.

00:25:10.947 --> 00:25:12.282
But why…

00:25:12.365 --> 00:25:15.910
Major countries are leveraging connections
with their country's fate at stake

00:25:15.994 --> 00:25:18.621
to obtain mining rights from Zaquir.

00:25:20.457 --> 00:25:22.667
But Chairman Jang?

00:25:27.297 --> 00:25:30.091
He and their king are best buddies.

00:25:30.717 --> 00:25:33.928
They met while studying in the UK.
I guess they have a lot in common.

00:25:34.554 --> 00:25:39.434
They go on illegal hunts for animals
and enjoy parties together.

00:25:40.018 --> 00:25:42.312
This is how the world works.

00:25:42.395 --> 00:25:45.482
It can't work with only saints.

00:25:46.900 --> 00:25:48.902
So you're saying that's why

00:25:49.486 --> 00:25:53.031
you sold a seat on the Supreme Court
for the outcome of a trial?

00:25:53.823 --> 00:25:54.741
For national interest?

00:25:54.824 --> 00:25:58.203
I just told Shin Jung-seok
what I was worried about

00:25:58.286 --> 00:26:01.956
when Jang Hyeon-bae was sent to prison.

00:26:02.040 --> 00:26:03.958
He's the one who did something absurd.

00:26:04.501 --> 00:26:06.628
Then why did you pressure Justice Shin

00:26:06.711 --> 00:26:10.131
about Chairman Jang's case?

00:26:10.215 --> 00:26:12.008
You said you two were in the same boat.

00:26:12.092 --> 00:26:16.888
Pressure? How can a mere attorney
pressure a Supreme Court justice?

00:26:17.764 --> 00:26:21.601
I only expressed my opinion

00:26:22.602 --> 00:26:23.603
for our country.

00:26:24.813 --> 00:26:26.564
A mere attorney?

00:26:26.648 --> 00:26:29.401
You've run the country
from the shadows all your life.

00:26:30.985 --> 00:26:32.904
If I may, let me ask you something.

00:26:33.905 --> 00:26:37.742
Are you an attorney, Dr. Oh?

00:26:39.119 --> 00:26:40.495
Or are you a lobbyist?

00:26:46.668 --> 00:26:47.669
I'm…

00:26:48.545 --> 00:26:49.838
a mediator.

00:26:50.505 --> 00:26:52.006
A mediator?

00:26:53.716 --> 00:26:56.136
Some people have to stay backstage

00:26:56.970 --> 00:26:59.264
and get their hands dirty

00:27:00.223 --> 00:27:01.641
to do their part.

00:27:02.725 --> 00:27:05.687
They're the things
people on stage can't do.

00:27:05.770 --> 00:27:09.482
That's how the world goes round. Always.

00:27:10.733 --> 00:27:12.318
I see.

00:27:12.402 --> 00:27:14.988
Did the people on stage ask you to do so?

00:27:15.071 --> 00:27:18.283
Many in the Blue House
are former Oh & Partners employees, right?

00:27:18.950 --> 00:27:21.995
I don't know. Which administration
are you talking about?

00:27:22.078 --> 00:27:26.666
It's hard to remember them all
since they change every five years.

00:27:32.130 --> 00:27:34.048
Why did you want to see me?

00:27:39.179 --> 00:27:43.892
Your lifelong dream
was to be a justice, right?

00:27:47.562 --> 00:27:48.563
I'm sorry?

00:27:49.772 --> 00:27:51.149
I've been observing you.

00:27:52.400 --> 00:27:53.902
You're clever.

00:27:54.486 --> 00:27:56.070
And you have guts too.

00:27:56.905 --> 00:27:58.656
Instead of being caught up in the past,

00:27:58.740 --> 00:28:02.410
you're reasonable enough
to focus only on the future.

00:28:03.953 --> 00:28:07.332
I'm not sure what you're getting at?

00:28:13.254 --> 00:28:15.590
I'll give you Shin Jung-seok's post.

00:28:19.093 --> 00:28:22.805
He doesn't have what it takes
to sit in that seat.

00:28:24.224 --> 00:28:26.434
Someone like you should go sit there

00:28:26.976 --> 00:28:28.353
and bring about change.

00:28:30.480 --> 00:28:33.191
I'll help you fulfill that dream of yours.

00:28:33.900 --> 00:28:37.487
You deserve it.

00:28:58.925 --> 00:28:59.926
All done.

00:29:01.845 --> 00:29:05.640
Your lifelong dream
was to be a justice, right?

00:29:05.723 --> 00:29:08.351
I'll give you Shin Jung-seok's post.

00:29:09.644 --> 00:29:10.895
Mr. Kang.

00:29:13.022 --> 00:29:16.276
I wrote the draft
for Dr. Oh's examination.

00:29:18.695 --> 00:29:19.612
Mr…

00:29:20.738 --> 00:29:22.031
Mr. Kang?

00:29:22.907 --> 00:29:23.741
Yes?

00:29:28.955 --> 00:29:32.125
What have you been doing all day
when the trial is almost here?

00:29:32.208 --> 00:29:33.334
You're acting dazed.

00:29:34.544 --> 00:29:36.421
Right.

00:29:38.214 --> 00:29:40.592
Sorry, I have a headache.

00:29:42.844 --> 00:29:44.053
I need some fresh air.

00:29:49.058 --> 00:29:51.311
What is he doing? Seriously.

00:29:51.978 --> 00:29:55.356
He doesn't seem confident this time.
What do we do?

00:29:56.399 --> 00:29:58.192
He does seem different
from his usual self.

00:30:32.685 --> 00:30:34.103
Don't look back.

00:30:35.605 --> 00:30:36.814
Keep moving forward.

00:30:37.982 --> 00:30:40.485
Just keep moving forward without stopping.

00:30:43.529 --> 00:30:45.406
You must…

00:30:46.282 --> 00:30:48.368
become successful.

00:30:51.579 --> 00:30:53.122
Go as far…

00:30:54.707 --> 00:30:57.085
as you can, my son.

00:31:05.593 --> 00:31:07.762
COURT

00:31:07.845 --> 00:31:09.973
CONFRONTATION CROSS-EXAMINATION
FOR SHIN AND JANG

00:31:28.825 --> 00:31:31.077
Thank you for attending, Justice Shin.

00:31:35.081 --> 00:31:38.042
All people are equal before the law.

00:31:38.126 --> 00:31:41.796
It is a citizen's duty to appear in court
as a witness, isn't it?

00:31:43.756 --> 00:31:47.176
As Justice Shin made time
out of his busy schedule to be here,

00:31:47.260 --> 00:31:49.679
please keep the examination
to the necessary minimum.

00:31:50.263 --> 00:31:53.057
If a question crosses the line,
I'll intervene with my authority.

00:31:53.141 --> 00:31:54.183
Is that understood?

00:31:54.267 --> 00:31:55.101
Yes, Your Honor.

00:31:55.184 --> 00:31:57.311
Mr. Kang, start your examination.

00:32:06.821 --> 00:32:10.825
Thank you both for attending.

00:32:14.120 --> 00:32:15.371
Let me ask you then.

00:32:15.955 --> 00:32:19.917
Have you met each other before today?

00:32:22.754 --> 00:32:24.088
No, I haven't.

00:32:25.465 --> 00:32:26.466
No.

00:32:27.425 --> 00:32:29.218
You have never met in person. Okay.

00:32:30.261 --> 00:32:34.974
Then, have you contacted each other before
through another person?

00:32:35.558 --> 00:32:37.602
-What?
-For example,

00:32:37.685 --> 00:32:41.564
Chairman Jang's former attorney,
Former Justice Byeon Jung-heon,

00:32:41.647 --> 00:32:44.317
attended the same high school as Mr. Shin.

00:32:44.400 --> 00:32:45.651
And you two are close.

00:32:47.070 --> 00:32:48.613
We did go to the same high school,

00:32:49.614 --> 00:32:51.783
but we are not close.

00:32:52.617 --> 00:32:56.162
You've never contacted each other
through Former Justice Byeon?

00:32:56.245 --> 00:32:57.330
I said I haven't!

00:32:58.289 --> 00:32:59.290
Your Honor.

00:32:59.373 --> 00:33:03.127
The defendant is repeating
the same question over and over again.

00:33:03.211 --> 00:33:04.420
Move on, Mr. Kang.

00:33:05.088 --> 00:33:06.297
Yes, Your Honor.

00:33:06.380 --> 00:33:08.758
I will ask Mr. Shin then.

00:33:08.841 --> 00:33:10.927
During Jang Hyeon-bae's criminal trial,

00:33:11.010 --> 00:33:13.763
were you the chief
of Seoul Central District Court?

00:33:15.431 --> 00:33:18.392
-Yes.
-This is a civil complaint log

00:33:18.476 --> 00:33:19.811
from that court.

00:33:22.188 --> 00:33:24.232
As you can see, there was someone

00:33:24.315 --> 00:33:26.901
who filed a petition almost every day.

00:33:26.984 --> 00:33:29.654
Her name is Kim Myeong-ok.

00:33:29.737 --> 00:33:31.823
This is what the petition says.

00:33:31.906 --> 00:33:34.033
"Please investigate and punish
Chief Judge Kang Da-wit

00:33:34.117 --> 00:33:36.577
for causing the unjust death of my husband

00:33:37.203 --> 00:33:40.498
with a manipulated trial ten years ago."

00:33:41.999 --> 00:33:43.126
Kim Myeong-ok is the mother

00:33:43.209 --> 00:33:46.921
of Yoo Jae-beom, the person who framed me
with a fake bribery video

00:33:47.004 --> 00:33:48.631
and forced me quit as a judge.

00:33:49.966 --> 00:33:54.137
But one day, you suddenly contacted
the court's administrative office

00:33:54.220 --> 00:33:57.431
and asked around
for Ms. Kim's contact information.

00:33:58.307 --> 00:33:59.350
Why did you do that?

00:34:00.560 --> 00:34:03.771
Isn't that too trivial
of a thing to remember?

00:34:04.397 --> 00:34:06.440
When I took sentenced
Chairman Jang to prison,

00:34:07.108 --> 00:34:11.195
and when the Court Employees' Union
recommended me as a justice,

00:34:12.530 --> 00:34:15.283
you started trying
to keep in touch with the person

00:34:15.366 --> 00:34:17.243
who held the deepest grudge against me.

00:34:17.326 --> 00:34:19.495
Don't you think the timing is too perfect?

00:34:19.579 --> 00:34:21.330
I told you I don't remember.

00:34:22.540 --> 00:34:24.083
And even if I did so,

00:34:24.750 --> 00:34:29.088
I probably tried to take care
of the civil complaint as court chief.

00:34:30.214 --> 00:34:32.258
But you dared to call me to court

00:34:32.341 --> 00:34:35.595
to ask these petty questions?

00:34:36.179 --> 00:34:38.181
As expected, he's not easy to deal with.

00:34:38.264 --> 00:34:39.640
-He's impenetrable.
-Okay.

00:34:39.724 --> 00:34:42.518
Do not repeat any questions
that he has already answered.

00:34:44.228 --> 00:34:46.147
Before I was nominated as a justice,

00:34:46.230 --> 00:34:49.442
you were the most leading candidate.

00:34:49.525 --> 00:34:52.945
After I resigned because of Yoo Jae-beom,
you became a justice right away.

00:34:53.821 --> 00:34:55.198
Was that a coincidence?

00:34:55.281 --> 00:34:57.450
-Mr. Kang.
-Yes, Your Honor!

00:34:57.533 --> 00:34:59.911
You are repeating vague,
speculative questions

00:34:59.994 --> 00:35:02.163
that are offensive in your examination.

00:35:02.246 --> 00:35:05.875
I am limiting your examination
of Mr. Shin.

00:35:05.958 --> 00:35:07.251
Please stop now.

00:35:19.680 --> 00:35:21.390
Yes, Your Honor.

00:35:33.819 --> 00:35:34.987
Okay.

00:35:35.696 --> 00:35:37.490
Let me ask the plaintiff.

00:35:38.115 --> 00:35:40.576
You had a rough time
in this court last time. Correct?

00:35:44.330 --> 00:35:45.539
No.

00:35:45.623 --> 00:35:46.499
I see.

00:35:47.041 --> 00:35:50.002
Here is data on public opinion
after your last trial.

00:35:50.836 --> 00:35:52.004
The number of petitions

00:35:52.088 --> 00:35:55.466
in support of "The rearrest
and punishment of evil tycoon Jang."

00:35:55.549 --> 00:35:56.968
Do you see it?

00:35:57.051 --> 00:35:59.720
It's over 230,000 people.

00:36:00.263 --> 00:36:01.389
Just ignore that.

00:36:01.973 --> 00:36:03.599
It's a meaningless number.

00:36:03.683 --> 00:36:06.811
The retrial will be held soon.

00:36:07.812 --> 00:36:10.815
When new evidence
found in this trial is submitted,

00:36:10.898 --> 00:36:14.443
there is a good chance
you'll be found guilty again.

00:36:15.027 --> 00:36:15.945
Did you know that?

00:36:16.028 --> 00:36:18.114
Objection, Your Honor.
That's baseless speculation.

00:36:18.197 --> 00:36:20.992
Defense counsel, are you threatening
the plaintiff right now?

00:36:21.075 --> 00:36:24.662
I was only reminding him of his situation.

00:36:25.246 --> 00:36:26.998
The initial sentence he received

00:36:27.081 --> 00:36:29.834
was ten years in prison
and a fine of 70 billion won.

00:36:29.917 --> 00:36:32.461
-Do you remember that?
-Defense counsel!

00:36:32.545 --> 00:36:37.550
What will happen if the serious offense
of bribery is added to the list?

00:36:37.633 --> 00:36:38.551
Mr. Kang.

00:36:39.760 --> 00:36:40.761
What…

00:36:41.721 --> 00:36:44.265
What are you talking about?

00:36:44.348 --> 00:36:46.392
And it wasn't just any bribe.

00:36:46.475 --> 00:36:51.022
What if you were released
in exchange for a justice position?

00:36:54.191 --> 00:36:55.901
Gosh, that would be unheard of.

00:36:56.777 --> 00:36:58.070
-What?
-Your Honor!

00:36:58.154 --> 00:37:00.364
-Mr. Kang!
-Yes, Your Honor!

00:37:00.448 --> 00:37:04.452
Despite being warned several times,

00:37:04.535 --> 00:37:08.080
the defendant has completely ignored
this Court's proceedings of the trial.

00:37:08.748 --> 00:37:13.502
You have continued with speculative
and offensive questions.

00:37:13.586 --> 00:37:16.213
Stop the examination at once.

00:37:20.301 --> 00:37:21.594
Are you afraid of something?

00:37:22.595 --> 00:37:23.637
I am warning you.

00:37:24.638 --> 00:37:28.309
If you say another word,
you will be detained immediately.

00:37:28.392 --> 00:37:30.686
-Bailiff.
-Yes, Your Honor.

00:37:31.395 --> 00:37:32.772
Mr. Kang!

00:37:37.485 --> 00:37:38.944
I'm sorry I'm late.

00:37:40.654 --> 00:37:42.198
Dr. Oh?

00:37:44.742 --> 00:37:47.370
What is he doing here?
I thought he was never coming.

00:37:49.997 --> 00:37:51.165
Hello, sir.

00:37:52.416 --> 00:37:56.462
You didn't respond,
so we assumed you were not coming.

00:37:57.129 --> 00:37:59.632
This is a trial
all of Korea is curious about, isn't it?

00:37:59.715 --> 00:38:02.551
Even if the questions
go a bit over the line,

00:38:02.635 --> 00:38:04.345
they must leave no suspicion at all.

00:38:05.054 --> 00:38:06.722
Isn't that right, Justice Shin?

00:38:14.855 --> 00:38:16.899
Right. Then…

00:38:18.442 --> 00:38:20.194
Will you testify?

00:38:20.277 --> 00:38:22.863
Of course. Why else would I be here?

00:38:26.700 --> 00:38:29.578
Your Honor, my apologies,

00:38:30.204 --> 00:38:32.665
but I will retract my examination request

00:38:33.207 --> 00:38:35.334
-for Mr. Oh Gyu-jang.
-What?

00:38:35.418 --> 00:38:36.836
-What?
-Pardon?

00:38:39.380 --> 00:38:40.714
You're retracting it?

00:38:40.798 --> 00:38:43.592
Yes. I didn't know who would appear,

00:38:43.676 --> 00:38:45.594
so I requested
all three of them as witnesses.

00:38:46.512 --> 00:38:49.473
Now that everyone's here,
just the two of them should be enough.

00:38:49.557 --> 00:38:51.475
-My apologies, Your Honor.
-What on earth?

00:38:52.852 --> 00:38:53.853
Okay.

00:38:54.687 --> 00:38:56.105
I'm sorry for causing you trouble.

00:39:00.151 --> 00:39:01.402
It's all right.

00:39:01.485 --> 00:39:04.196
Since I'm here, I'll observe the trial.

00:39:11.579 --> 00:39:15.207
-What's he doing all of a sudden?
-What on earth's with him?

00:39:27.428 --> 00:39:29.555
What are you doing, Mr. Kang?

00:39:29.638 --> 00:39:31.640
Why did you retract it
when he willingly came?

00:39:31.724 --> 00:39:33.100
Let's be realistic.

00:39:34.018 --> 00:39:37.188
It'll be impossible
to try to take down Dr. Oh too.

00:39:37.271 --> 00:39:39.815
Are you telling us
to let Dr. Oh walk free?

00:39:40.566 --> 00:39:41.984
Mr. Kang.

00:39:42.568 --> 00:39:43.777
Tell me it's not true.

00:39:46.530 --> 00:39:47.531
Mr. Woo,

00:39:48.324 --> 00:39:50.868
what on earth is going on?

00:39:51.577 --> 00:39:53.496
There's clearly something going on, sir.

00:39:54.205 --> 00:39:55.581
Kang Da-wit.

00:39:55.664 --> 00:39:57.708
That fool has hatched some kind of scheme.

00:39:58.459 --> 00:40:01.962
Dr. Oh sides with anyone
who is useful to him.

00:40:02.046 --> 00:40:06.133
What if Dr. Oh has decided to abandon us?

00:40:06.217 --> 00:40:08.469
Then, it'll be over for us.

00:40:09.553 --> 00:40:10.554
My goodness.

00:40:14.767 --> 00:40:16.560
We will continue then.

00:40:17.770 --> 00:40:21.690
Let's see why a justice position
can be a bribe.

00:40:22.358 --> 00:40:27.571
A bribe not only includes money, items,
and other financial benefits

00:40:27.655 --> 00:40:30.407
but also all tangible
and intangible benefits

00:40:30.491 --> 00:40:34.620
that satisfy a person's needs and desires
according to Supreme Court precedent.

00:40:36.789 --> 00:40:37.790
A justice position.

00:40:37.873 --> 00:40:41.335
Isn't it a powerful object of desire?

00:40:43.921 --> 00:40:46.715
Tax evasion, embezzlement,

00:40:46.799 --> 00:40:49.009
verbal and physical abuse
against employees,

00:40:49.093 --> 00:40:52.680
and sexual abuse against housekeepers.

00:40:52.763 --> 00:40:58.435
Such a despicable criminal gave away
a justice position for a rigged trial.

00:40:58.519 --> 00:41:02.022
And then, he pretends to be the victim
and sues me for damages,

00:41:02.106 --> 00:41:04.692
claiming I manipulated his trial.

00:41:08.946 --> 00:41:11.532
Have you even thought
about the increase in sentence

00:41:12.116 --> 00:41:14.618
that would be imposed on you, sir?

00:41:16.829 --> 00:41:19.331
Are you threatening us in open court

00:41:19.415 --> 00:41:21.834
with baseless and false information?

00:41:21.917 --> 00:41:23.460
What will you do if I have evidence?

00:41:24.837 --> 00:41:26.714
What evidence do you have?

00:41:28.757 --> 00:41:31.385
An audio recording
has already been disclosed once in court.

00:41:32.595 --> 00:41:34.346
Right, Your Honor?

00:41:36.140 --> 00:41:37.516
What if…

00:41:40.394 --> 00:41:41.604
there is another recording?

00:41:41.687 --> 00:41:43.022
What?

00:41:50.821 --> 00:41:53.907
If you have it, submit it
and stop mocking the court.

00:41:53.991 --> 00:41:55.451
Yes, I'll submit it, Your Honor.

00:41:55.534 --> 00:41:58.245
At the end of today's
confrontation cross-examination,

00:41:58.329 --> 00:42:01.206
I will submit an additional recording.

00:42:01.290 --> 00:42:03.792
-What? Mr. Kang.
-We don't have it though.

00:42:03.876 --> 00:42:05.669
Is he out of his mind? What's his plan?

00:42:09.590 --> 00:42:11.884
He never takes on a fight he'll lose.

00:42:22.436 --> 00:42:25.898
Sir, are you really planning
on taking all the blame?

00:42:27.483 --> 00:42:30.361
You should be sick of hearing
Article 52 of the Criminal Act by now.

00:42:30.444 --> 00:42:32.905
"If someone admits
to the crime they have committed,

00:42:32.988 --> 00:42:36.158
punishment may be mitigated or remitted."

00:42:36.825 --> 00:42:37.993
You know that.

00:42:41.080 --> 00:42:43.791
Your confession is no good
once the evidence is disclosed.

00:42:56.637 --> 00:42:58.472
-Okay.
-Say something!

00:42:59.390 --> 00:43:00.641
Then…

00:43:01.767 --> 00:43:05.187
Wait! Wait, just hold on!

00:43:06.689 --> 00:43:07.981
-Sorry?
-I'll talk.

00:43:12.403 --> 00:43:13.779
About what, sir?

00:43:13.862 --> 00:43:15.197
It wasn't me.

00:43:15.280 --> 00:43:16.740
He's the one who offered first!

00:43:21.453 --> 00:43:22.621
What are you talking about?

00:43:22.705 --> 00:43:24.873
He said he could get me out

00:43:24.957 --> 00:43:27.960
and allow me to get my revenge on you

00:43:28.585 --> 00:43:30.713
if I could make him a justice!

00:43:42.307 --> 00:43:44.226
That's nonsense.

00:43:44.309 --> 00:43:45.769
How is that even possible?

00:43:46.437 --> 00:43:50.023
You have a huge influence
in the political and business world.

00:43:50.107 --> 00:43:53.610
You're also close with key figures
in this administration. Correct?

00:44:10.711 --> 00:44:14.423
It seems you've set up a trap
and are framing me.

00:44:16.508 --> 00:44:20.471
This claim was never valid
in the first place.

00:44:20.554 --> 00:44:23.807
A Supreme Court justice is appointed

00:44:23.891 --> 00:44:26.769
according to the Constitution
through a meticulous process.

00:44:26.852 --> 00:44:28.645
It's a sacred position.

00:44:28.729 --> 00:44:33.066
That means it's impossible
to make it the subject of a deal.

00:44:33.150 --> 00:44:37.696
The defendant is defaming
the order and Constitution

00:44:38.906 --> 00:44:40.115
of this country.

00:44:45.078 --> 00:44:46.580
Impossible?

00:44:53.921 --> 00:44:55.088
Then, what is this?

00:44:57.674 --> 00:45:01.512
Your lifelong dream
was to be a justice, right?

00:45:01.595 --> 00:45:03.597
So you're saying that's why

00:45:04.306 --> 00:45:08.060
you sold a seat on the Supreme Court
for the outcome of a trial?

00:45:08.143 --> 00:45:09.645
For national interest?

00:45:09.728 --> 00:45:13.565
I just told Shin Jung-seok
what I was worried about

00:45:13.649 --> 00:45:17.694
when Jang Hyeon-bae was sent to prison.

00:45:17.778 --> 00:45:20.072
He's the one who did something absurd.

00:45:20.155 --> 00:45:22.616
I'll give you Shin Jung-seok's post.

00:45:24.117 --> 00:45:26.578
He doesn't have what it takes
to sit in that seat.

00:45:27.955 --> 00:45:29.748
Someone like you should go sit there

00:45:29.831 --> 00:45:31.041
and bring about change.

00:45:31.625 --> 00:45:34.419
I'll help you fulfill that dream of yours.

00:45:44.930 --> 00:45:46.640
How can I trust you, sir?

00:45:47.724 --> 00:45:48.725
I don't know.

00:45:49.560 --> 00:45:51.186
What can I do to win your trust?

00:45:56.692 --> 00:45:58.527
Please come to court.

00:46:00.487 --> 00:46:01.863
-Court?
-Yes.

00:46:02.864 --> 00:46:04.866
If you're present in court,

00:46:04.950 --> 00:46:07.202
the judge will remain neutral
at the very least.

00:46:07.286 --> 00:46:09.871
If you just appear in court,
I'll retract my request

00:46:11.540 --> 00:46:12.791
to summon you as a witness.

00:46:16.712 --> 00:46:17.713
So,

00:46:19.590 --> 00:46:20.924
you're going to use me

00:46:21.008 --> 00:46:23.051
as a decoy?

00:46:32.269 --> 00:46:33.562
For my entire life,

00:46:35.063 --> 00:46:37.399
becoming a Supreme Court justice
had been my dream.

00:46:38.442 --> 00:46:40.944
But if this position can become

00:46:41.028 --> 00:46:42.863
the subject of a dirty deal like this,

00:46:43.822 --> 00:46:45.240
I will decline.

00:46:45.782 --> 00:46:47.159
Gosh, he's so cool.

00:46:47.242 --> 00:46:48.827
I'm too good for it.

00:46:53.457 --> 00:46:55.542
Just give it to that guy.

00:46:56.418 --> 00:46:57.419
What?

00:46:59.963 --> 00:47:02.507
Do I have to keep listening
to these insults?

00:47:02.591 --> 00:47:03.550
That's enough!

00:47:04.134 --> 00:47:05.636
What are you doing?

00:47:05.719 --> 00:47:09.431
Didn't you retract your request
to have Mr. Oh as a witness?

00:47:09.514 --> 00:47:13.435
I am merely trying to uncover
the truth of the case, Your Honor.

00:47:13.518 --> 00:47:17.606
Dr. Oh, you said you helped Chairman Jang
in the name of national interest.

00:47:17.689 --> 00:47:21.401
However, when I looked into it,

00:47:21.485 --> 00:47:23.570
there seemed to be more than that.

00:47:25.697 --> 00:47:26.782
What is that?

00:47:26.865 --> 00:47:28.408
This is a consulting agreement

00:47:28.492 --> 00:47:32.621
Chairman Jang and Dr. Oh signed
for a rare-earth element mining business.

00:47:32.704 --> 00:47:34.206
"If the business succeeds,

00:47:34.289 --> 00:47:37.209
ten percent of the revenue share
will be granted."

00:47:38.126 --> 00:47:39.795
Ten percent?

00:47:40.420 --> 00:47:41.630
Incredible.

00:47:41.713 --> 00:47:43.632
A businessman would never agree
to such a deal

00:47:43.715 --> 00:47:45.509
unless he was in prison and cornered.

00:47:48.595 --> 00:47:50.222
I'm sorry, but let me ask you.

00:47:50.806 --> 00:47:52.182
Why did you do that?

00:47:52.265 --> 00:47:55.727
You're not someone
desperately in need of money.

00:47:59.064 --> 00:48:00.816
You said you've done your part backstage

00:48:01.400 --> 00:48:03.568
as a mediator to help the world go round.

00:48:05.237 --> 00:48:07.155
I guess you can't do that anymore.

00:48:08.699 --> 00:48:09.658
Because now,

00:48:10.909 --> 00:48:11.993
you're on stage.

00:48:49.364 --> 00:48:52.534
-Sir, tell us to leave no suspicion.
-Is it true, sir?

00:48:52.617 --> 00:48:54.661
Please say something
so the people can understand.

00:48:54.745 --> 00:48:57.831
Did you make a deal
using a justice position as a bribe?

00:48:59.541 --> 00:49:00.542
Mom.

00:49:01.710 --> 00:49:03.962
Why did I want to become
a Supreme Court justice?

00:49:04.838 --> 00:49:06.548
At first, I had reasons.

00:49:07.466 --> 00:49:10.677
But after some time,
I guess I forgot about them…

00:49:11.887 --> 00:49:13.180
like a fool.

00:49:31.323 --> 00:49:32.741
All rise.

00:49:35.786 --> 00:49:38.288
Mr. Woo, what on earth is going on?

00:49:49.966 --> 00:49:51.510
It's been a while, Myeong-hun.

00:49:51.593 --> 00:49:54.721
It has been a while, Jung-in.

00:49:55.931 --> 00:49:57.808
And what is that?

00:49:57.891 --> 00:49:59.643
An additional recording.

00:50:00.352 --> 00:50:05.232
Did the great Dr. Oh really not know
his daughter was recording his call?

00:50:05.816 --> 00:50:08.318
That already makes no sense.

00:50:09.694 --> 00:50:11.863
You can't trust anyone right now.

00:50:11.947 --> 00:50:15.700
For now, let's see how it goes in court.

00:50:23.750 --> 00:50:25.710
It's over for you.

00:50:26.586 --> 00:50:29.297
-You bastard!
-Bailiff!

00:50:29.381 --> 00:50:32.300
I can't believe I trusted
a bastard like you!

00:50:32.384 --> 00:50:33.718
Get the hell off me.

00:50:34.845 --> 00:50:35.720
He should be ashamed.

00:50:35.804 --> 00:50:36.805
What are you looking at?

00:50:39.057 --> 00:50:41.101
-Are you all right?
-Yeah.

00:50:42.143 --> 00:50:43.395
Good job, Myeong-hun.

00:50:46.898 --> 00:50:48.859
I didn't wink at you.

00:50:50.485 --> 00:50:52.279
It's a habit of mine.

00:50:58.827 --> 00:50:59.703
What?

00:51:00.495 --> 00:51:02.414
You think this will be the end

00:51:03.248 --> 00:51:04.708
for someone like me?

00:51:07.961 --> 00:51:10.213
Darn. I got scared.

00:51:11.047 --> 00:51:14.134
You might want to dye your hair a bit
since you'll be on the news.

00:51:22.517 --> 00:51:25.770
-What?
-You son of a bitch.

00:51:27.439 --> 00:51:28.565
Got it.

00:51:31.151 --> 00:51:32.694
Is it true?

00:51:32.777 --> 00:51:34.779
-Please say something.
-So you admit it?

00:51:39.868 --> 00:51:42.579
-Kang Da-wit!
-Geez, for goodness' sake.

00:51:45.206 --> 00:51:46.791
Come on.

00:52:01.765 --> 00:52:03.433
My mushrooms are back and intact!

00:52:03.516 --> 00:52:05.977
It's just like it used to be!

00:52:06.061 --> 00:52:08.772
I missed our office so much!

00:52:08.855 --> 00:52:09.856
Are you happy?

00:52:10.607 --> 00:52:12.525
I can't believe this.

00:52:12.609 --> 00:52:15.111
They could have moved us
to a room with sunlight.

00:52:15.737 --> 00:52:19.157
-Why is it this dark and shady room again?
-What? So you can go see the CEO?

00:52:20.533 --> 00:52:22.118
Say you'll be a spy for a new office.

00:52:22.869 --> 00:52:25.747
I told you several times
to stop saying that.

00:52:25.830 --> 00:52:27.499
No. I'll say it for the rest of my life.

00:52:27.582 --> 00:52:29.376
-For the rest of your life?
-Yeah.

00:52:29.459 --> 00:52:31.586
-Geez, Yoo Nan-hui!
-Hi.

00:52:31.670 --> 00:52:33.380
-Mr. Kang!
-Mr. Kang!

00:52:33.463 --> 00:52:37.676
It's been a while since I've been here,
so this room feels pretty cozy.

00:52:37.759 --> 00:52:39.678
Right? But only your stuff
hasn't arrived yet.

00:52:39.761 --> 00:52:41.763
Really?
Well, I've chosen a different office.

00:52:41.846 --> 00:52:45.183
-Where?
-Up there. Way up there.

00:52:45.266 --> 00:52:47.060
-Mr. Kang.
-Yes?

00:52:47.852 --> 00:52:48.979
I'm sorry.

00:52:50.605 --> 00:52:51.439
About what?

00:52:52.023 --> 00:52:53.400
Well…

00:52:53.483 --> 00:52:55.360
Honestly, when you suddenly retracted

00:52:55.902 --> 00:52:58.571
your witness request for Dr. Oh,
I got suspicious.

00:52:59.197 --> 00:53:01.866
I thought you may have made
a secret compromise.

00:53:01.950 --> 00:53:05.662
When are you going to
actually trust me, Ms. Park?

00:53:05.745 --> 00:53:07.455
It was understandable though.

00:53:07.998 --> 00:53:11.167
You seemed to have a lot on your mind
up until the day before the trial.

00:53:11.251 --> 00:53:12.627
For goodness' sake.

00:53:12.711 --> 00:53:15.880
That's right. You didn't look confident
about winning at all.

00:53:15.964 --> 00:53:17.841
-My goodness.
-That's right.

00:53:17.924 --> 00:53:20.010
When a chatterbox
is suddenly silent for days,

00:53:20.093 --> 00:53:21.469
wouldn't that be weird?

00:53:21.553 --> 00:53:24.848
Geez, how many times
do I have to tell you?

00:53:24.931 --> 00:53:29.644
If you don't get it, memorize it.
We will win no matter what!

00:53:29.728 --> 00:53:32.188
If we were bound to lose,
I wouldn't have even started!

00:53:32.272 --> 00:53:34.274
-Got it?
-Yes!

00:53:34.357 --> 00:53:36.818
Now, let's go to Tongin Sundae-guk
to celebrate our return!

00:53:36.901 --> 00:53:39.696
-Okay!
-We'll split the bill though.

00:53:39.779 --> 00:53:41.781
Split the bill for sundae-guk.

00:53:44.784 --> 00:53:45.744
He's back.

00:53:45.827 --> 00:53:47.704
-He's so back.
-He sure is back.

00:53:49.706 --> 00:53:52.584
SUPREME PROSECUTORS' OFFICE

00:53:52.667 --> 00:53:53.918
Move out of the way!

00:53:58.089 --> 00:53:59.340
Please move back.

00:54:04.137 --> 00:54:05.263
Justice Shin.

00:54:05.346 --> 00:54:08.349
An arrest warrant will be issued
after questioning today.

00:54:08.433 --> 00:54:09.434
Were you aware of this?

00:54:14.022 --> 00:54:17.108
I did everything
for the good of the country.

00:54:18.026 --> 00:54:19.360
Despite being a sitting justice,

00:54:19.444 --> 00:54:22.363
you're being investigated
as an accomplice to a serial con artist.

00:54:23.031 --> 00:54:24.240
Aren't you ashamed?

00:54:31.915 --> 00:54:33.583
Please say a few words!

00:54:51.476 --> 00:54:53.019
I thought you were still a child.

00:55:06.866 --> 00:55:10.036
You were able to avoid
imprisonment in the end.

00:55:11.663 --> 00:55:14.040
I still have some friends who like me.

00:55:19.796 --> 00:55:20.797
Leave your things here.

00:55:22.090 --> 00:55:23.633
I'll ask Ms. Seo to send them to you.

00:55:24.884 --> 00:55:25.885
Okay.

00:55:28.972 --> 00:55:30.348
Thanks.

00:55:32.559 --> 00:55:33.560
Father.

00:55:35.854 --> 00:55:37.272
Why didn't you suspect

00:55:38.273 --> 00:55:40.358
that Da-wit would do such a thing?

00:55:43.778 --> 00:55:45.405
There hadn't been anyone.

00:55:46.823 --> 00:55:48.658
There wasn't a single person

00:55:49.492 --> 00:55:51.452
who had declined my proposal

00:55:51.953 --> 00:55:53.705
in the past 20 years.

00:56:06.801 --> 00:56:07.844
Jung-in.

00:56:09.596 --> 00:56:13.391
I learned that you were just like me.

00:56:15.810 --> 00:56:16.811
Good luck.

00:56:35.079 --> 00:56:37.874
HOW'S THE SUNLIGHT FROM THE SOUTHEAST?
FROM JUNG-IN

00:56:52.388 --> 00:56:53.389
Yes, this is it.

00:56:54.891 --> 00:56:56.517
Is this facing southeast?

00:56:57.602 --> 00:56:59.729
This is the place where I belong.

00:57:00.438 --> 00:57:02.482
This is a new beginning.

00:57:03.066 --> 00:57:06.819
Using this as a stepping stone,
I'll go as far--

00:57:08.780 --> 00:57:09.781
Mr. Kang.

00:57:11.157 --> 00:57:12.367
Yes, Ms. Kim?

00:57:12.450 --> 00:57:15.411
There's a meeting
for the new management group.

00:57:15.495 --> 00:57:16.704
A meeting?

00:57:17.372 --> 00:57:18.623
Of course, I should go.

00:57:23.545 --> 00:57:24.712
Could you say that again?

00:57:24.796 --> 00:57:26.673
-Sorry?
-A meeting for who?

00:57:27.590 --> 00:57:29.842
The new management group.

00:57:34.556 --> 00:57:36.224
The management group!

00:57:48.236 --> 00:57:49.237
Hello, Mr. Kang.

00:57:50.780 --> 00:57:55.785
Right. Mr. Woo will be joining us.
He did a great job last time.

00:57:55.868 --> 00:57:57.912
Come on. I didn't do much.

00:57:59.539 --> 00:58:00.456
I'm glad to join you.

00:58:04.043 --> 00:58:05.044
Sure, Mr. Woo.

00:58:10.550 --> 00:58:13.011
-I'll do my best.
-You should.

00:58:19.350 --> 00:58:23.605
Now, this will be a new start
for Oh & Partners.

00:58:24.188 --> 00:58:28.401
We'll grow into a global law firm
that wins with the best legal expertise,

00:58:28.484 --> 00:58:30.528
not with lobbying or shady deals.

00:58:30.612 --> 00:58:34.324
Okay, everyone. Let's work together.

00:58:34.407 --> 00:58:35.241
Okay.

00:58:45.960 --> 00:58:48.755
Okay. Shall we begin
with a pressing matter?

00:58:49.547 --> 00:58:52.258
Mr. Woo brought a case with him
from Baekseung.

00:58:52.342 --> 00:58:54.802
Yes, as you can see,

00:58:55.553 --> 00:58:57.055
this case involves Bilton Chemical.

00:58:57.805 --> 00:59:01.434
We have to take on this case
no matter what.

00:59:02.018 --> 00:59:03.728
We should form a strategy task force.

00:59:03.811 --> 00:59:06.564
If it's Bilton Chemical,
isn't it the toxic diaper case?

00:59:08.232 --> 00:59:11.361
Please mind your choice of words.

00:59:11.444 --> 00:59:12.445
Could you put it up?

00:59:13.946 --> 00:59:17.200
It's not toxic.
It's an eco-friendly product.

00:59:17.283 --> 00:59:20.370
Didn't babies get hurt and die
from their side effects?

00:59:21.537 --> 00:59:23.956
There were a few cases among consumers

00:59:24.040 --> 00:59:26.417
with unique constitutions
who had trouble adjusting.

00:59:26.501 --> 00:59:30.088
The scientific cause-and-effect
hasn't been fully uncovered yet.

00:59:30.171 --> 00:59:32.674
Right. And the lawsuit has begun
in America too?

00:59:32.757 --> 00:59:35.551
It'll take much longer there.

00:59:36.135 --> 00:59:40.098
Once we get a dismissal in Korea first…

00:59:40.682 --> 00:59:44.185
We'll be able take on the case
in America too, right?

00:59:44.268 --> 00:59:45.311
That's right.

00:59:45.395 --> 00:59:47.230
Okay. Mr. Kwon,

00:59:47.313 --> 00:59:49.440
please secure a group
of cooperative experts.

00:59:49.524 --> 00:59:52.568
Ms. Yoo can draw up early PR strategies.

00:59:52.652 --> 00:59:53.945
Yes, ma'am.

00:59:54.028 --> 00:59:55.446
And Mr. Kang.

00:59:56.364 --> 00:59:58.324
You can set up
the framework for the trial.

00:59:58.908 --> 01:00:02.036
A small court that won't attract noise
would be better, right?

01:00:04.205 --> 01:00:08.251
How about we file a lawsuit
to confirm the non-existence of debt

01:00:08.334 --> 01:00:10.044
before the victims get together?

01:00:10.128 --> 01:00:12.004
That's a great strategy.

01:00:13.673 --> 01:00:15.091
Right, Mr. Kang?

01:00:26.185 --> 01:00:27.019
Hey!

01:00:27.687 --> 01:00:29.480
Mr. Kang!

01:00:29.564 --> 01:00:31.566
You could hurt your back that way.

01:00:31.649 --> 01:00:32.650
Hello, Mr. Kang!

01:00:32.734 --> 01:00:34.652
-Mr. Kang!
-My goodness!

01:00:34.736 --> 01:00:36.404
-Long time no see!
-Hi.

01:00:36.487 --> 01:00:38.114
You're all here.

01:00:39.157 --> 01:00:40.950
We're so upset.

01:00:41.033 --> 01:00:43.870
It's so hard to see you
now that you're part of management.

01:00:43.953 --> 01:00:46.581
What? Have you all missed me?

01:00:47.248 --> 01:00:48.249
Missed you? As if.

01:00:48.332 --> 01:00:50.877
When a stray cat suddenly goes missing,

01:00:51.502 --> 01:00:53.755
-you just wonder about it. That's all.
-Geez.

01:00:53.838 --> 01:00:56.507
A stray cat?
Wait, who would that be on this team?

01:00:57.258 --> 01:01:00.219
By the way, why were you looking for
product liability case files?

01:01:00.303 --> 01:01:02.305
It's for the toxic diaper case, of course.

01:01:02.388 --> 01:01:03.723
-I have no time for this.
-What?

01:01:03.806 --> 01:01:06.559
There's a shantytown we visit
to provide free legal consultation.

01:01:06.642 --> 01:01:09.312
Two babies from there are hospitalized
and in serious condition.

01:01:09.395 --> 01:01:11.481
Their families grabbed onto us and cried.

01:01:12.440 --> 01:01:15.067
It was so heartbreaking.

01:01:15.151 --> 01:01:17.653
Those jerks advertised them
as new eco-friendly material.

01:01:18.654 --> 01:01:21.032
Gi-ppeum, I just found a US article!

01:01:21.115 --> 01:01:23.201
-Really?
-Just a moment.

01:01:23.284 --> 01:01:25.286
It says they launched
a lawsuit in Missouri.

01:01:26.704 --> 01:01:27.705
You all haven't changed.

01:01:28.456 --> 01:01:31.167
We'll be working late from now on
because of this case.

01:01:31.250 --> 01:01:34.837
-It's a great opportunity for us.
-Being a pro bono attorney is so…

01:01:34.921 --> 01:01:36.088
Do you want a transfer?

01:01:38.090 --> 01:01:39.634
If it's hard, I'll transfer you.

01:01:41.219 --> 01:01:42.470
Really?

01:01:43.137 --> 01:01:45.097
Hey, I'm part of the management now.

01:01:46.682 --> 01:01:48.017
Mr. Kang, I…

01:01:48.100 --> 01:01:51.562
-The US babies are also…
-Yeah, they're after the same thing here.

01:01:51.646 --> 01:01:53.606
They have the same symptoms
as Korean babies.

01:01:53.689 --> 01:01:54.732
-Right.
-Yeah.

01:01:54.816 --> 01:01:56.234
Thank you so much for the offer,

01:01:57.193 --> 01:01:58.986
-but I'm okay.
-Why not? It was your dream.

01:01:59.070 --> 01:01:59.946
I'll transfer you.

01:02:00.029 --> 01:02:02.448
These scumbags.

01:02:02.532 --> 01:02:03.950
I must've become attached to them.

01:02:04.909 --> 01:02:08.496
Nan-hui, Yeong-sil, and Gi-ppeum.

01:02:10.248 --> 01:02:12.500
It is fun to work with them.

01:02:14.669 --> 01:02:16.754
You mentioned Nan-hui's name first.

01:02:17.463 --> 01:02:18.339
What?

01:02:19.590 --> 01:02:22.677
No, it was just by alphabetical order.

01:02:22.760 --> 01:02:25.096
-Hey, Jun-u. Aren't you going to work?
-I am.

01:02:26.931 --> 01:02:29.433
Alphabetical order, my foot.

01:02:30.184 --> 01:02:32.937
They're saying the same thing
as what we found.

01:02:34.021 --> 01:02:36.732
I think it's going
as Ms. Park mentioned before.

01:02:38.317 --> 01:02:39.777
BILTON CHEMICAL DIAPERS

01:02:41.195 --> 01:02:42.363
NEWBORN BABIES' UNKNOWN RASH

01:02:42.446 --> 01:02:43.990
BABY DIES FROM ACUTE ALLERGY

01:02:47.201 --> 01:02:48.786
MOTHERS WAIL AS SUSPICIONS SPREAD

01:02:52.957 --> 01:02:54.542
What matters more

01:02:55.501 --> 01:02:57.128
is whether you can win or not.

01:02:58.254 --> 01:02:59.547
You're not asking me about it.

01:03:01.507 --> 01:03:02.633
About what?

01:03:02.717 --> 01:03:04.135
What the truth is.

01:03:06.304 --> 01:03:07.346
Does it not matter?

01:03:09.056 --> 01:03:10.182
I guess I just need to win.

01:03:17.356 --> 01:03:20.484
What's the occasion? If it's about work,
we can talk at the firm.

01:03:21.110 --> 01:03:22.445
No, I'm good.

01:03:22.528 --> 01:03:23.571
You're not drinking?

01:03:27.909 --> 01:03:29.201
You said once back then

01:03:29.285 --> 01:03:33.331
that when there's one lie
among 99 truths,

01:03:33.414 --> 01:03:36.375
-people can't tell which is which.
-Yeah, I said that.

01:03:37.710 --> 01:03:39.795
Remember the time we went to Gangneung?

01:03:43.466 --> 01:03:45.384
That was so long ago. Why all of a sudden?

01:03:46.344 --> 01:03:50.181
When we were drinking, we talked
about our most embarrassing moment.

01:03:50.973 --> 01:03:54.769
For you, it was when you cried at school
that one time you weren't top student.

01:03:54.852 --> 01:03:55.811
For me,

01:03:55.895 --> 01:03:58.689
it was when I borrowed money
to buy a gift for my crush

01:03:59.231 --> 01:04:01.150
and then got totally rejected.

01:04:03.444 --> 01:04:05.363
Bang Ji-min.

01:04:07.031 --> 01:04:09.241
Why are you taking so long
to get to your point?

01:04:09.325 --> 01:04:13.788
How was Yoo Jae-beom able to
talk about that and deceive me?

01:04:14.747 --> 01:04:17.208
Do you remember Ji-min?

01:04:18.376 --> 01:04:21.420
-Do you mean Bang Ji-min?
-Yeah, your first love.

01:04:21.504 --> 01:04:23.297
Get out of here, you punk.

01:04:23.381 --> 01:04:25.049
She had a crush on me, but I didn't.

01:04:25.132 --> 01:04:27.593
-No, I wasn't into her.
-Is that so?

01:04:27.677 --> 01:04:32.765
You begged me to lend you 30,000 won
to buy her a birthday gift,

01:04:32.848 --> 01:04:34.350
and you still haven't paid me back.

01:04:35.685 --> 01:04:37.853
You were the only one in the world

01:04:38.646 --> 01:04:40.022
who knew about that story.

01:04:48.656 --> 01:04:49.865
Does that matter?

01:04:53.995 --> 01:04:55.079
Does it matter?

01:04:56.580 --> 01:05:01.127
If I hadn't been deceived then,
you would've had no chance.

01:05:01.210 --> 01:05:03.254
The chance to get rid of your father.

01:05:05.965 --> 01:05:08.801
How long are you going to talk
about the past for?

01:05:09.635 --> 01:05:14.223
Wouldn't it be more productive
to talk about the future?

01:05:21.897 --> 01:05:24.442
I know. You must be disgusted.

01:05:25.568 --> 01:05:26.569
I understand.

01:05:27.403 --> 01:05:28.779
Should I apologize?

01:05:29.822 --> 01:05:31.782
You probably won't buy it though.

01:05:35.745 --> 01:05:36.620
But, Da-wit,

01:05:37.705 --> 01:05:38.748
I need you.

01:05:38.831 --> 01:05:41.042
-Hey.
-I mean it.

01:05:41.959 --> 01:05:46.005
I want to turn Oh & Partners
into a global firm.

01:05:46.088 --> 01:05:48.257
I can't do it alone.

01:05:48.340 --> 01:05:51.844
I can make you co-CEO if you want.

01:05:54.346 --> 01:05:58.017
The Bilton Chemical case
will be our first step.

01:05:58.684 --> 01:06:00.686
I've decided to establish
a branch in the US too.

01:06:04.982 --> 01:06:07.401
Go global with me. Okay?

01:06:21.040 --> 01:06:23.125
ATTORNEY PARK GI-PPEUM

01:06:23.751 --> 01:06:25.628
-Yes, Ms. Park?
-Mr. Kang.

01:06:25.711 --> 01:06:27.880
I know you're busy,
but could you make some time?

01:06:27.963 --> 01:06:29.256
Why? Is there a problem?

01:06:29.840 --> 01:06:32.343
My parents insisted that I bring you home.

01:06:32.885 --> 01:06:34.804
Your parents?

01:06:36.555 --> 01:06:37.640
Don't be nervous, everyone.

01:06:37.723 --> 01:06:39.767
-He's here.
-He's here.

01:06:40.518 --> 01:06:41.393
You're all here.

01:06:41.977 --> 01:06:43.437
-Mr. Kang!
-Oh, my gosh!

01:06:43.521 --> 01:06:45.022
Mr. Kang, hurry and take a seat!

01:06:45.106 --> 01:06:47.066
-My goodness!
-What's going on? What is it?

01:06:48.234 --> 01:06:49.485
What's happening?

01:06:50.528 --> 01:06:51.487
What's going on?

01:06:54.115 --> 01:06:56.617
-Happy birthday to you
-Happy birthday to you

01:06:56.700 --> 01:06:57.576
Happy birthday…

01:06:57.660 --> 01:06:59.245
It's not my birthday though.

01:07:00.996 --> 01:07:03.833
-Blow out the candle first!
-Just blow out the candle!

01:07:03.916 --> 01:07:05.918
-Blow it out first!
-Blow it out! Hurry!

01:07:06.001 --> 01:07:07.920
-Big breath.
-Blow it out.

01:07:08.504 --> 01:07:09.713
WE LIVE HAPPILY THANKS TO YOU

01:07:15.970 --> 01:07:18.097
Thank you, Mr. Kang.

01:07:18.180 --> 01:07:19.598
Wait, why?

01:07:19.682 --> 01:07:21.892
Why are you suddenly doing this?

01:07:21.976 --> 01:07:23.561
You saved our family.

01:07:23.644 --> 01:07:25.813
The bankruptcy trial 15 years ago.

01:07:26.772 --> 01:07:29.942
Gosh, no. I was just doing my job.

01:07:30.025 --> 01:07:34.280
My parents nagged me so much
about thanking you.

01:07:36.866 --> 01:07:38.117
"Thank you."

01:07:39.493 --> 01:07:44.748
"Because of a great man like you,
our family could live a happy life."

01:07:47.668 --> 01:07:49.503
"Thank you, Judge Kang."

01:07:51.672 --> 01:07:53.966
This is so touching.

01:07:54.049 --> 01:07:55.926
A round of applause!

01:07:56.760 --> 01:07:59.096
Goodness! Please don't.

01:07:59.180 --> 01:08:01.974
I'm not a judge anymore.

01:08:03.058 --> 01:08:05.978
I'm not that much of a good person.

01:08:06.061 --> 01:08:08.147
I only think about myself.

01:08:09.231 --> 01:08:10.983
Both then and now.

01:08:11.066 --> 01:08:12.234
"Both then and now."

01:08:12.860 --> 01:08:16.447
"No. Think about why your name is Da-wit."

01:08:18.365 --> 01:08:23.621
"You're like David who fought
for the weak against Goliath."

01:08:24.538 --> 01:08:26.332
"Both then and now."

01:08:27.708 --> 01:08:29.793
Come to think of it, it's true. "Da-wit."

01:08:30.669 --> 01:08:32.254
Who gave you that name?

01:08:44.725 --> 01:08:46.644
Taking care of this group is important,

01:08:46.727 --> 01:08:49.230
but the people we should aim for first

01:08:49.897 --> 01:08:51.023
are in this group.

01:08:51.649 --> 01:08:53.400
We should identify and contact

01:08:53.484 --> 01:08:55.861
the moderate parents
who haven't joined the victims yet

01:08:55.945 --> 01:08:58.072
and separate them from the radical group.

01:08:58.155 --> 01:09:00.950
We'll pay a moderate level
of compensation in advance

01:09:01.033 --> 01:09:03.452
on the condition
they testify favorably for us.

01:09:04.995 --> 01:09:09.083
These families are on the edge
of poverty due to hospital bills.

01:09:09.166 --> 01:09:12.711
So, there is a very high chance
they'll accept our offer.

01:09:13.629 --> 01:09:14.713
Okay…

01:09:17.216 --> 01:09:18.259
What is it, Mr. Kang?

01:09:19.176 --> 01:09:20.928
Kang Eu-ddeum.

01:09:23.138 --> 01:09:25.474
-Min Ha-rin.
-What are you doing?

01:09:26.100 --> 01:09:27.726
Ye-jun.

01:09:28.811 --> 01:09:29.895
Kim Ye-jun.

01:09:30.896 --> 01:09:33.399
-Yoon Sae-bom.
-What are you doing? Stop.

01:09:33.482 --> 01:09:35.609
Hey, hold on!

01:09:37.945 --> 01:09:39.530
Song Mi-ri-nae.

01:09:40.990 --> 01:09:41.991
It all sounds good.

01:09:43.659 --> 01:09:47.162
But let's proceed
after looking at their faces.

01:09:47.246 --> 01:09:50.958
You should know which children's lives
you're making deals with.

01:09:55.170 --> 01:09:57.214
-Mr. Kang.
-One day,

01:09:57.756 --> 01:10:00.968
their names will become the names of laws…

01:10:02.970 --> 01:10:05.931
to ensure these incidents
won't ever happen again.

01:10:06.557 --> 01:10:07.558
Okay?

01:10:10.811 --> 01:10:11.645
Yes?

01:10:35.127 --> 01:10:36.462
Let's continue.

01:10:36.545 --> 01:10:37.755
Yes, I will…

01:10:38.339 --> 01:10:40.257
I will continue.

01:10:41.050 --> 01:10:42.593
How is it going in America?

01:10:44.386 --> 01:10:47.097
What do you mean
we can't take the diaper case?

01:10:47.181 --> 01:10:48.432
Why not?

01:10:48.515 --> 01:10:51.727
Because Oh & Partners
will represent the opposing party.

01:10:52.603 --> 01:10:55.356
-Bilton Chemical?
-I was hoping it wasn't true.

01:10:55.439 --> 01:10:58.942
Mr. Kang, you're part of the management.
Isn't there any way?

01:11:00.152 --> 01:11:02.404
They asked me to find a way to win

01:11:03.572 --> 01:11:05.908
before any more victims get together.

01:11:05.991 --> 01:11:08.243
Are you really going to do it?

01:11:09.661 --> 01:11:13.499
I mean, you were a pro bono attorney too.
Have you forgotten about it already?

01:11:16.585 --> 01:11:19.004
So if we insist on taking the case,

01:11:20.172 --> 01:11:21.882
are you going to disband and fire us?

01:11:21.965 --> 01:11:23.634
Really?

01:11:23.717 --> 01:11:25.511
Mr. Kang!

01:11:31.558 --> 01:11:34.061
From now on, we are…

01:11:41.026 --> 01:11:42.528
going independent.

01:11:42.611 --> 01:11:43.904
What?

01:11:44.780 --> 01:11:45.781
What is this?

01:11:47.116 --> 01:11:50.244
Are you launching
a pro bono law firm?

01:11:50.327 --> 01:11:52.704
-Really?
-Who does such a thing?

01:11:52.788 --> 01:11:54.456
-That doesn't make money.
-What?

01:11:54.540 --> 01:11:56.417
What do I hate the most
in the whole world?

01:11:57.209 --> 01:11:59.086
-Being a sucker?
-That's right.

01:11:59.169 --> 01:12:02.881
I'll gather everyone
who was unfairly made into suckers,

01:12:02.965 --> 01:12:06.427
and I'll make sure to teach the ones
who looked down on them.

01:12:06.510 --> 01:12:09.596
When you apologize,
it's not done with words.

01:12:10.431 --> 01:12:11.890
It has to be done with cash.

01:12:12.724 --> 01:12:16.562
When you represent victims one by one,
they won't make money.

01:12:16.645 --> 01:12:19.398
But when you gather hundreds,
thousands, and tens of thousands,

01:12:19.481 --> 01:12:22.943
they become clients of cases
worth tens of billions of won.

01:12:23.026 --> 01:12:26.405
I'll represent those
who were unfairly made into suckers,

01:12:27.531 --> 01:12:29.491
and with contingency fees,

01:12:32.286 --> 01:12:33.579
I'm going to put up a building.

01:12:34.288 --> 01:12:37.291
Right next to this one but higher!

01:12:38.292 --> 01:12:40.377
So it'll block
all the sunlight to this building!

01:12:45.716 --> 01:12:46.842
So mushrooms will grow well!

01:12:51.180 --> 01:12:52.181
Pack your stuff.

01:12:55.350 --> 01:12:57.394
I should call a moving truck.

01:12:57.478 --> 01:12:58.312
Eye for an Eye!

01:13:01.523 --> 01:13:03.650
We have to pack up again?

01:13:03.734 --> 01:13:04.902
Come on, Jun-u!

01:13:04.985 --> 01:13:07.404
I just unpacked,
but we have to pack up again?

01:13:07.488 --> 01:13:09.281
"Law Firm Eye for an Eye."

01:13:09.364 --> 01:13:11.200
CEO AND ATTORNEY KANG DA-WIT

01:13:13.911 --> 01:13:16.246
And they say you can't fix a person.

01:13:16.330 --> 01:13:18.123
LOOKING FOR BILTON CHEMICAL DIAPER VICTIMS

01:13:18.207 --> 01:13:19.791
LAW FIRM EYE FOR AN EYE

01:13:34.348 --> 01:13:36.099
-Hold this.
-Hey!

01:13:36.183 --> 01:13:37.017
Just for a second.

01:13:37.100 --> 01:13:38.977
-I need to talk…
-What is it now?

01:13:39.061 --> 01:13:40.395
The business cards.

01:13:41.522 --> 01:13:43.065
I'm Kang Da-wit.

01:13:43.148 --> 01:13:45.067
Hello, I'm Kang Da-wit!

01:13:45.776 --> 01:13:47.152
I'm Kang Da-wit!

01:13:47.236 --> 01:13:48.946
Call me when you need us.

01:13:49.029 --> 01:13:50.864
-Thank you.
-We're Eye for an Eye.

01:13:50.948 --> 01:13:52.282
I'm Attorney Kang Da-wit.

01:13:53.450 --> 01:13:54.368
Defendant.

01:13:54.993 --> 01:13:57.162
Nothing further, correct?
I will conclude the trial.

01:13:57.246 --> 01:13:59.122
Your Honor!

01:14:00.290 --> 01:14:03.210
If you tell us to leave the house
in this freezing weather…

01:14:03.293 --> 01:14:06.421
In this world,
there are people who always lose.

01:14:06.505 --> 01:14:08.507
It's public rental housing.

01:14:08.590 --> 01:14:10.259
We were missing just a single document.

01:14:10.342 --> 01:14:14.721
No matter how hard they try,
they're too weak to fight the world.

01:14:21.019 --> 01:14:24.189
We will close arguments
and deliver the verdict.

01:14:24.273 --> 01:14:25.107
COURT

01:14:25.190 --> 01:14:27.818
-The verdict will be delivered--
-Just a moment!

01:14:32.447 --> 01:14:34.825
EYE FOR AN EYE

01:14:39.997 --> 01:14:44.251
Your Honor, thank you for your service
in this cold weather.

01:14:44.334 --> 01:14:47.337
We have just been appointed
the defendants' attorneys.

01:14:48.839 --> 01:14:51.216
You represent the defendants?

01:14:51.300 --> 01:14:54.469
Yes, Your Honor.
Please allow arguments to resume.

01:14:56.805 --> 01:14:59.933
And pro bono attorneys are by their side.

01:15:04.354 --> 01:15:08.317
So even if we lose, we lose together.

01:16:23.850 --> 01:16:25.852
