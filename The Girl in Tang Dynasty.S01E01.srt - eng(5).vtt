00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:52.800
There is a girl in Hua Village.

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:54.600
named Hua Xiaochi.

00:01:55.080 --> 00:01:57.360
There was a legend

00:01:57.440 --> 00:01:59.880
once dominated the capital with business.

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:01.440
and a rich family.

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:03.960
With the blessing of our ancestors,

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:05.960
and inherited his business talent.

00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:07.080
You're a wise man

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:08.880
and become a businessman.

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:10.360
and achieve success.

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:12.240
You'll have a better future.

00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:13.960
are far beyond ordinary people.

00:02:13.960 --> 00:02:16.480
[They have to gamble.] [They have to be careful.]

00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:17.840
The debts were built high.

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:19.200
He even

00:02:19.240 --> 00:02:22.120
as his wife.

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:24.680
Hua Xiao Zheng will never obey.

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:26.360
Make a clear wish.

00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:51.720
Hua Xiaotong!

00:02:52.240 --> 00:02:52.960
I'm coming.

00:02:52.960 --> 00:02:54.760
It's here. It's here. It's here.

00:02:54.800 --> 00:02:56.130
I've seen my ancestors.

00:02:56.480 --> 00:02:57.640
Hua Xiao Zheng.

00:02:58.560 --> 00:03:00.520
I'm your ancestor.

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:04.560
I am your ancestor.

00:03:04.960 --> 00:03:05.800
What?

00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:10.960
Cherish your good years.

00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:12.960
and control your own life.

00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:15.400
You will meet

00:03:15.800 --> 00:03:19.480
a good husband.

00:03:19.480 --> 00:03:20.680
Remember,

00:03:21.079 --> 00:03:23.940
you should start your career first and get married.

00:03:24.360 --> 00:03:26.320
If you choose the wrong husband,

00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:29.320
fate will change.

00:03:30.800 --> 00:03:33.480
Make it clear.

00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:36.960
Go to Chang'an.

00:04:00.400 --> 00:04:01.520
I'm still alive.

00:04:02.200 --> 00:04:03.360
I'm still alive.

00:04:21.760 --> 00:04:23.000
I said you jumped into the well.

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:24.360
In order to escape marriage,

00:04:24.360 --> 00:04:25.800
to escape marriage.

00:04:26.960 --> 00:04:27.640
Marry me.

00:04:28.560 --> 00:04:30.120
I'll kill you if you don't.

00:04:30.240 --> 00:04:31.440
Get married.

00:04:32.360 --> 00:04:34.360
Servants, welcome the bride.

00:04:38.440 --> 00:04:40.760
Music, dance.

00:04:56.800 --> 00:04:59.080
What is spirit in the water?

00:05:00.960 --> 00:05:03.320
Riding a white whale to chase the salmon

00:05:05.520 --> 00:05:08.000
Walking with a girl, the Nagisa of the river

00:05:09.440 --> 00:05:12.000
and flows in the future.

00:05:12.560 --> 00:05:14.890
Madam, this is your marriage invitation.

00:05:19.640 --> 00:05:20.760
Hua Xiao Zheng.

00:05:21.320 --> 00:05:23.200
as the head of the Carp Alliance.

00:05:23.200 --> 00:05:24.760
The wife of a scholar Zhang.

00:05:30.360 --> 00:05:32.200
I shouldn't have died.

00:05:32.440 --> 00:05:33.680
God gave me

00:05:33.680 --> 00:05:34.960
another chance.

00:05:39.880 --> 00:05:41.080
to welcome the bride.

00:05:53.960 --> 00:05:54.680
Today,

00:05:55.120 --> 00:05:57.520
the head of the Carp Alliance is getting married.

00:05:57.520 --> 00:06:00.200
Please propose a toast to River God.

00:06:01.680 --> 00:06:02.880
God of River. Cheers.

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:03.930
Bow to River God.

00:06:10.760 --> 00:06:12.560
River God has shown his presence.

00:06:12.560 --> 00:06:15.560
The joy is unlimited, and the disease is unstoppable.

00:06:16.440 --> 00:06:18.000
It's just a fish.

00:06:18.440 --> 00:06:19.840
Let's welcome the groom.

00:06:21.760 --> 00:06:24.880
The carp is leaping high. The director is mighty.

00:06:25.200 --> 00:06:28.120
The carp is leaping high. The director is mighty.

00:06:28.560 --> 00:06:29.440
Thank you.

00:06:29.560 --> 00:06:31.000
Judging from the aura,

00:06:31.320 --> 00:06:33.120
he must be a strong person.

00:06:33.880 --> 00:06:34.409
Brother.

00:06:35.440 --> 00:06:37.560
Xiao Zheng, I'm your husband.

00:06:37.760 --> 00:06:38.960
Mr. Zhang.

00:06:40.440 --> 00:06:43.000
This momentum is so deceitful.

00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:44.240
Don't be shy.

00:06:44.680 --> 00:06:45.200
Here.

00:06:47.440 --> 00:06:48.880
Remember,

00:06:48.960 --> 00:06:51.120
you should start your career first and get married.

00:06:51.120 --> 00:06:52.920
If you choose the wrong husband,

00:06:53.120 --> 00:06:55.560
my fate changed.

00:06:55.560 --> 00:06:57.440
I got married before I started my career.

00:06:57.440 --> 00:06:58.360
I can't change my fate.

00:06:58.360 --> 00:06:59.560
Bride and groom,

00:06:59.760 --> 00:07:00.880
To River God.

00:07:01.320 --> 00:07:03.080
Didn't we toast just now?

00:07:04.440 --> 00:07:05.880
Here's the thing, Xiao Zheng.

00:07:05.880 --> 00:07:07.760
This is our rule.

00:07:07.960 --> 00:07:09.320
We need to

00:07:09.440 --> 00:07:11.200
to River God.

00:07:11.240 --> 00:07:12.880
With the protection of River God,

00:07:12.880 --> 00:07:14.640
can we get married.

00:07:15.440 --> 00:07:15.960
Here.

00:07:16.760 --> 00:07:17.690
What should I do?

00:07:17.800 --> 00:07:19.130
I can't get married now.

00:07:20.560 --> 00:07:21.800
God of River, bless me.

00:07:21.800 --> 00:07:22.860
River God bless us!

00:07:24.560 --> 00:07:25.200
River God.

00:07:31.880 --> 00:07:32.520
Xiao Zheng!

00:07:32.520 --> 00:07:33.450
Don't come over.

00:07:34.240 --> 00:07:34.760
Don't.

00:07:35.120 --> 00:07:36.120
What are you doing?

00:07:36.120 --> 00:07:37.320
Don't come over.

00:07:38.080 --> 00:07:39.000
I have the fish.

00:07:39.080 --> 00:07:40.000
Don't move.

00:07:40.200 --> 00:07:40.860
Xiao Zheng.

00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:43.680
Don't hurt the relic of our alliance.

00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:44.880
No, it's fine.

00:07:45.120 --> 00:07:46.240
I won't get married.

00:07:46.240 --> 00:07:46.800
Let me go.

00:07:47.120 --> 00:07:48.000
That won't do.

00:07:48.120 --> 00:07:49.440
We're engaged.

00:07:49.640 --> 00:07:51.520
You're a member of the Zhang family.

00:07:51.520 --> 00:07:53.880
If you die, you'll be the ghost of my family.

00:07:53.880 --> 00:07:54.360
I...

00:07:54.760 --> 00:07:56.560
I can't explain it to you.

00:07:57.120 --> 00:07:58.000
I have the fish.

00:07:58.120 --> 00:07:59.180
Put down the knife.

00:07:59.880 --> 00:08:00.760
Put it down.

00:08:02.200 --> 00:08:03.320
Prepare a boat for me.

00:08:03.320 --> 00:08:04.440
Can you row?

00:08:04.880 --> 00:08:05.520
Boat.

00:08:05.760 --> 00:08:07.200
Ship! Ship! Ship!

00:08:09.200 --> 00:08:10.260
Xiao Zheng, relax.

00:08:10.320 --> 00:08:11.080
Think about it.

00:08:11.080 --> 00:08:12.680
the fish in your hand is innocent.

00:08:12.680 --> 00:08:14.080
is innocent.

00:08:14.080 --> 00:08:16.120
This is the sacred thing of our alliance.

00:08:16.120 --> 00:08:18.120
We still need it to protect us.

00:08:18.120 --> 00:08:18.850
Cut the crap.

00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:21.200
Hand over the boat. Hand over the fish.

00:08:23.440 --> 00:08:24.320
River God.

00:08:33.679 --> 00:08:35.200
Save River God!

00:08:50.320 --> 00:08:51.160
Yuanhan,

00:08:51.800 --> 00:08:52.920
Did you find him?

00:08:53.080 --> 00:08:53.680
Brother.

00:08:54.080 --> 00:08:55.280
I can't find the fish.

00:08:55.920 --> 00:08:57.680
Keep looking.

00:10:36.720 --> 00:10:37.680
Let go of me!

00:10:38.840 --> 00:10:39.560
I finally

00:10:39.560 --> 00:10:40.920
to swim ashore.

00:10:41.320 --> 00:10:43.180
but you almost stepped on my head.

00:10:43.280 --> 00:10:43.840
You...

00:10:47.800 --> 00:10:48.960
Nice step.

00:10:49.320 --> 00:10:51.800
Bro, let's talk about it.

00:10:51.800 --> 00:10:52.720
A woman

00:10:53.200 --> 00:10:55.080
She didn't show up sooner or later.

00:10:55.080 --> 00:10:56.720
Why now?

00:10:57.160 --> 00:10:58.160
Do you want to die?

00:10:58.960 --> 00:11:01.040
I'm looking for a way out, boss.

00:11:05.600 --> 00:11:07.600
He doesn't look like an accomplice.

00:11:07.800 --> 00:11:08.440
So stupid.

00:11:09.200 --> 00:11:10.160
Who are you?

00:11:10.320 --> 00:11:11.440
Bring it to the detention center.

00:11:11.440 --> 00:11:13.200
Pass what?

00:11:13.440 --> 00:11:14.080
Pass

00:11:15.080 --> 00:11:15.680
Right.

00:11:15.920 --> 00:11:17.080
If you don't pass, you can't

00:11:17.080 --> 00:11:18.440
in Chang'an.

00:11:18.480 --> 00:11:19.320
then

00:11:19.480 --> 00:11:21.280
change your fate?

00:11:21.440 --> 00:11:22.720
Me neither.

00:11:25.200 --> 00:11:26.800
He ran away from marriage.

00:11:26.920 --> 00:11:29.200
How could he think so much?

00:11:30.320 --> 00:11:32.200
Officer, help!

00:11:32.400 --> 00:11:32.920
Let go!

00:11:33.680 --> 00:11:34.600
Let go!

00:11:37.160 --> 00:11:38.600
I hate women crying.

00:11:38.920 --> 00:11:39.650
Stop crying.

00:11:40.400 --> 00:11:41.400
I'll let you live.

00:11:42.480 --> 00:11:43.960
Go back to where you came from.

00:11:43.960 --> 00:11:45.440
I have my way to live in Chang'an.

00:11:45.440 --> 00:11:46.570
I want to go back too.

00:11:46.720 --> 00:11:47.480
You can't enter Chang'an

00:11:47.480 --> 00:11:49.080
you can't get into Chang'an.

00:11:49.080 --> 00:11:50.410
Stop thinking about it.

00:12:15.160 --> 00:12:15.490
Boss.

00:12:16.400 --> 00:12:17.440
Keep a close watch.

00:12:17.440 --> 00:12:18.720
The annual

00:12:18.720 --> 00:12:19.840
in Chang'an.

00:12:20.560 --> 00:12:21.960
Everyone on alert.

00:12:22.320 --> 00:12:23.680
Don't let anyone

00:12:23.680 --> 00:12:24.400
sneak in.

00:12:25.080 --> 00:12:25.680
Yes.

00:12:58.480 --> 00:12:59.210
Look at that.

00:13:00.800 --> 00:13:01.200
Look over there.

00:13:01.200 --> 00:13:02.080
I've never seen it before.

00:13:02.080 --> 00:13:02.810
What's that?

00:13:03.080 --> 00:13:03.560
Me too.

00:13:03.680 --> 00:13:05.280
I've never seen this before.

00:13:07.200 --> 00:13:08.160
Buns.

00:13:08.320 --> 00:13:10.040
Fresh steamed buns!

00:13:10.320 --> 00:13:11.580
Boss, give me two buns.

00:13:11.800 --> 00:13:12.280
Okay.

00:13:15.480 --> 00:13:17.160
This is Chang'an.

00:13:18.080 --> 00:13:20.560
The capital of Tang, Chang'an.

00:13:23.800 --> 00:13:24.680
Tanghulu!

00:13:26.560 --> 00:13:27.480
Candied haws.

00:13:28.680 --> 00:13:29.540
Lord Xu, try it.

00:13:31.920 --> 00:13:32.320
Okay.

00:13:32.840 --> 00:13:33.320
Miss.

00:13:35.200 --> 00:13:37.000
Why can I see him everywhere I go?

00:13:37.680 --> 00:13:38.280
Take it.

00:13:38.800 --> 00:13:39.440
Take it.

00:13:39.480 --> 00:13:40.540
What are you doing?

00:13:46.320 --> 00:13:48.280
Are you threatening me because I didn't go to prison?

00:13:48.280 --> 00:13:50.680
I'll use you for private protection fee.

00:13:58.920 --> 00:14:00.120
You haven't paid yet.

00:14:01.320 --> 00:14:02.160
I'm sorry.

00:14:02.160 --> 00:14:02.760
It's okay.

00:14:16.440 --> 00:14:19.080
If you want to be the No.1 female merchant in Tang, you have to take the first step.

00:14:19.080 --> 00:14:19.880
the first step

00:14:20.200 --> 00:14:22.800
to get rid of the stumbling block in front of me.

00:14:23.960 --> 00:14:24.560
Yae!

00:14:25.040 --> 00:14:27.040
This is your favorite candied haws.

00:14:41.440 --> 00:14:42.840
Thanks to our ancestors,

00:14:43.200 --> 00:14:44.560
I came back alive today.

00:14:58.200 --> 00:14:59.680
You're still up so late.

00:15:00.040 --> 00:15:02.160
He must be doing something shady.

00:15:18.200 --> 00:15:21.040
In broad daylight

00:15:21.560 --> 00:15:22.080
How...

00:15:22.200 --> 00:15:22.730
Who is it?

00:15:35.440 --> 00:15:36.200
Close your eyes.

00:15:36.200 --> 00:15:37.080
Rascal.

00:15:38.080 --> 00:15:39.040
Where's my knife?

00:15:39.040 --> 00:15:40.100
Where's the knife?

00:15:48.440 --> 00:15:49.040
Let's go.

00:15:52.800 --> 00:15:54.080
You pervert!

00:15:54.920 --> 00:15:56.280
I didn't mean to

00:15:56.280 --> 00:15:58.040
watch you take a shower.

00:15:58.280 --> 00:15:59.740
You didn't manage a place.

00:16:00.080 --> 00:16:01.480
How dare you sneak into the city?

00:16:01.480 --> 00:16:02.040
I...

00:16:02.040 --> 00:16:02.960
Stop talking.

00:16:03.840 --> 00:16:06.200
You sneaked into the city and trespassed.

00:16:06.200 --> 00:16:07.200
Intentional assault.

00:16:07.200 --> 00:16:09.330
Send him to the government office now.

00:16:21.200 --> 00:16:22.600
Why are you staring at me?

00:16:23.040 --> 00:16:24.440
We're friends after all.

00:16:24.440 --> 00:16:26.320
We can take care of each other in Chang'an.

00:16:26.320 --> 00:16:28.400
Stop talking nonsense.

00:16:28.680 --> 00:16:29.440
Otherwise,

00:16:30.080 --> 00:16:31.080
Sword is blind.

00:16:31.960 --> 00:16:32.840
Don't.

00:16:33.160 --> 00:16:34.690
It's very useful to keep me.

00:16:34.800 --> 00:16:36.460
It'll be a waste if you kill me.

00:16:38.800 --> 00:16:39.440
Look.

00:16:39.800 --> 00:16:42.260
You remove your makeup and makeup every day.

00:16:42.280 --> 00:16:43.940
Your face is getting skinned.

00:16:50.280 --> 00:16:51.200
Skin

00:17:02.320 --> 00:17:04.440
This is moisturizing and moisturizing water.

00:17:04.440 --> 00:17:06.079
It's specially made by me.

00:17:06.200 --> 00:17:07.329
moisturizing baby.

00:17:14.599 --> 00:17:16.130
Look, it's done. It's done.

00:17:16.720 --> 00:17:17.480
One joss stick

00:17:17.480 --> 00:17:19.599
to make your skin look new.

00:17:21.160 --> 00:17:22.160
Do you want to try?

00:17:22.160 --> 00:17:24.839
I'll try it too.

00:17:30.440 --> 00:17:31.040
Come on.

00:17:40.160 --> 00:17:40.680
Look.

00:17:44.480 --> 00:17:45.440
Oh my god.

00:17:47.680 --> 00:17:48.960
Your face is tender.

00:17:49.640 --> 00:17:50.600
It's smooth.

00:17:53.040 --> 00:17:53.720
Hikaru.

00:17:57.520 --> 00:17:58.080
Just now...

00:17:58.080 --> 00:17:59.160
Logically,

00:17:59.400 --> 00:18:01.200
I should be responsible for you.

00:18:01.440 --> 00:18:01.680
But...

00:18:01.680 --> 00:18:02.480
the ancestors have shown their presence.

00:18:02.480 --> 00:18:05.120
I have to establish a career first and get married.

00:18:05.120 --> 00:18:06.000
So I can't

00:18:06.200 --> 00:18:07.460
this responsibility.

00:18:10.640 --> 00:18:11.240
I can't.

00:18:11.720 --> 00:18:13.520
Why are you blushing?

00:18:14.640 --> 00:18:16.440
What are you thinking about?

00:18:18.160 --> 00:18:20.360
Who's thinking about something dirty?

00:18:22.440 --> 00:18:23.970
Look at your blushing face.

00:18:24.200 --> 00:18:25.960
You're still thinking about dirty things.

00:18:25.960 --> 00:18:26.480
Bah!

00:18:27.120 --> 00:18:29.400
I, Xu Ziqi, am a bad commander in Chang'an.

00:18:29.400 --> 00:18:31.660
Why would I think about something dirty?

00:18:31.960 --> 00:18:32.820
How old are you?

00:18:32.880 --> 00:18:33.960
I'm 22.

00:18:35.200 --> 00:18:36.280
22 years old.

00:18:39.200 --> 00:18:40.530
You're not married yet?

00:18:43.360 --> 00:18:44.640
It's really rare.

00:18:48.720 --> 00:18:49.400
You...

00:18:50.400 --> 00:18:52.400
Get lost!

00:18:53.120 --> 00:18:54.200
Now...

00:19:06.160 --> 00:19:06.760
Forget it.

00:19:07.520 --> 00:19:09.250
You can sleep on the cold chair.

00:19:39.920 --> 00:19:43.000
This egg clear water is really good.

00:19:47.440 --> 00:19:49.840
I'm poor now.

00:19:50.040 --> 00:19:51.300
I have no one to rely on.

00:19:51.960 --> 00:19:54.440
I don't know how to become

00:19:57.240 --> 00:19:58.640
how to become

00:19:58.680 --> 00:20:00.540
the best female merchant in Tang?

00:20:13.120 --> 00:20:16.480
Get up early to embrace the sun

00:20:16.880 --> 00:20:18.200
Make life

00:20:18.680 --> 00:20:20.200
full of positive energy.

00:20:20.600 --> 00:20:22.360
Full of positive energy.

00:20:27.280 --> 00:20:28.280
Morning, Lord Xu.

00:20:31.120 --> 00:20:32.980
I've prepared breakfast for you.

00:20:35.440 --> 00:20:36.360
Let's eat first.

00:20:36.360 --> 00:20:38.020
I'll take you to a place later.

00:20:39.200 --> 00:20:39.720
Sure.

00:20:42.520 --> 00:20:44.120
Look at what you want

00:20:44.240 --> 00:20:45.570
Eat something you want.

00:20:45.920 --> 00:20:47.920
Don't think about it when you leave.

00:20:48.960 --> 00:20:50.040
You don't have a school.

00:20:50.040 --> 00:20:51.520
You die fast if you walk around.

00:20:51.520 --> 00:20:52.880
There is a place outside the city

00:20:52.880 --> 00:20:54.200
for people like you.

00:20:54.840 --> 00:20:56.240
Go and settle over there.

00:20:56.960 --> 00:20:58.200
Why is there a Concubine Hu?

00:20:58.200 --> 00:20:58.960
Have you forgotten?

00:20:58.960 --> 00:21:00.040
Today is the annual

00:21:00.040 --> 00:21:01.640
the annual charity auction.

00:21:01.840 --> 00:21:02.920
The auctioned prostitute, Gu Jin'er.

00:21:02.920 --> 00:21:04.520
by Gu Jin'er.

00:21:04.760 --> 00:21:05.960
Tonight, Pingkang Fang

00:21:05.960 --> 00:21:07.420
in Pingkang Fang tonight.

00:21:07.480 --> 00:21:08.040
Spending money.

00:21:08.040 --> 00:21:08.960
Last year,

00:21:09.120 --> 00:21:10.760
last year.

00:21:11.600 --> 00:21:12.640
Spend money.

00:21:13.440 --> 00:21:14.200
When you go out,

00:21:14.200 --> 00:21:15.640
to go out.

00:21:16.440 --> 00:21:18.280
But the place you're going

00:21:18.520 --> 00:21:19.240
is free.

00:21:19.440 --> 00:21:20.280
When you arrive,

00:21:20.280 --> 00:21:21.760
just say my name.

00:21:22.360 --> 00:21:23.600
But

00:21:24.040 --> 00:21:25.300
I still have some money

00:21:25.720 --> 00:21:26.760
I still have some money on me.

00:21:26.760 --> 00:21:28.020
It's more convenient.

00:21:30.000 --> 00:21:31.260
I have some money here.

00:21:31.680 --> 00:21:32.480
Take it.

00:21:39.000 --> 00:21:40.260
Are you chasing me away

00:21:42.000 --> 00:21:43.360
I want you to go outside the city

00:21:43.360 --> 00:21:44.360
outside the city.

00:21:48.000 --> 00:21:48.840
Lord Xu.

00:21:49.440 --> 00:21:50.770
I must stay in Chang'an.

00:21:51.960 --> 00:21:52.640
I'm sorry.

00:21:53.160 --> 00:21:54.090
What did you say?

00:21:56.760 --> 00:21:57.520
Lord Xu.

00:21:57.520 --> 00:21:59.160
Consider it a loan from me.

00:21:59.200 --> 00:22:00.520
I'll pay you back later.

00:22:00.520 --> 00:22:01.960
Hua Xiao Zheng.

00:22:02.520 --> 00:22:03.000
You...

00:22:10.880 --> 00:22:13.160
Okay.

00:22:13.520 --> 00:22:14.280
Okay.

00:22:14.920 --> 00:22:16.200
Good.

00:22:20.760 --> 00:22:21.360
Good.

00:22:25.520 --> 00:22:27.600
All the brocade boxes today

00:22:27.960 --> 00:22:30.640
were made by

00:22:30.640 --> 00:22:31.960
by Jin'er.

00:22:32.280 --> 00:22:32.960
The auction today

00:22:32.960 --> 00:22:34.600
all the money

00:22:34.680 --> 00:22:35.760
will be donated.

00:22:36.040 --> 00:22:37.040
Not a penny.

00:22:37.440 --> 00:22:39.000
I hope you

00:22:39.200 --> 00:22:40.360
to help us.

00:22:40.720 --> 00:22:41.920
Let's welcome

00:22:42.200 --> 00:22:43.240
Miss Jin'er.

00:22:58.200 --> 00:22:59.640
Okay.

00:23:01.720 --> 00:23:03.000
The delinquents in Chang'an

00:23:03.000 --> 00:23:04.460
to maintain social order.

00:23:04.520 --> 00:23:05.400
A delinquent.

00:23:05.480 --> 00:23:06.280
A delinquent.

00:23:06.440 --> 00:23:07.440
Here comes Lord Xu.

00:23:07.440 --> 00:23:10.400
Chairman of Anle Chamber of Commerce is here.

00:23:12.520 --> 00:23:13.450
Lower the sedan.

00:23:14.680 --> 00:23:15.680
Mr. Bang.

00:23:16.440 --> 00:23:17.480
Mr. Bang.

00:23:34.960 --> 00:23:35.960
Mr. Bang.

00:23:38.480 --> 00:23:39.280
Mr. Fang.

00:23:39.840 --> 00:23:42.120
You're still so charming.

00:23:42.240 --> 00:23:43.770
It keeps rising every year.

00:23:44.040 --> 00:23:45.280
Thank you, Lord Xu,

00:23:45.440 --> 00:23:47.040
for protecting me.

00:23:57.000 --> 00:23:59.000
Thank you, Mr. Bang.

00:24:02.880 --> 00:24:03.840
Mr. Xu.

Please take care of

00:24:05.640 --> 00:24:06.760
Thank you.

00:24:06.960 --> 00:24:08.480
I have prepared

00:24:08.480 --> 00:24:09.880

00:24:09.880 --> 00:24:11.960
We can catch up with you.

00:24:13.680 --> 00:24:14.520
Please.

00:24:14.960 --> 00:24:15.490
Let's go.

00:24:16.040 --> 00:24:16.920
You go up first.

00:24:17.160 --> 00:24:18.120
I'll be right back.

00:24:18.120 --> 00:24:19.120

Maintain order at the scene.

00:24:26.240 --> 00:24:26.680
Yes.

00:24:34.600 --> 00:24:35.640
This is

00:24:35.720 --> 00:24:37.240

00:24:37.680 --> 00:24:38.960

00:24:39.040 --> 00:24:40.840
will be auctioned for you.

00:24:43.200 --> 00:24:44.200
The last one

00:24:44.200 --> 00:24:45.880

over a hundred orphans.

00:24:53.160 --> 00:24:55.160
Jin'er also lost her family when she was young.

00:24:55.160 --> 00:24:56.440
I don't want them

00:24:56.440 --> 00:24:57.770
since they were little.

00:24:58.280 --> 00:24:59.720
If you pity me,

00:24:59.960 --> 00:25:01.680
I'll be grateful.

00:25:01.920 --> 00:25:02.520
Good.

00:25:02.640 --> 00:25:03.120
Okay.

00:25:03.520 --> 00:25:03.960
Okay.

00:25:06.280 --> 00:25:06.960
500 taels.

00:25:07.240 --> 00:25:08.040
800 taels

00:25:08.200 --> 00:25:09.160
1,000 taels.

00:25:09.680 --> 00:25:11.480
2,000 taels of gold.

00:25:12.480 --> 00:25:13.840
2,000 taels.

00:25:16.040 --> 00:25:17.000
2,000 taels

00:25:17.680 --> 00:25:18.760
Any higher price?

00:25:19.480 --> 00:25:20.520
2,000 taels.

00:25:21.920 --> 00:25:22.680
I announce

00:25:23.000 --> 00:25:24.200
the last box

00:25:24.360 --> 00:25:25.480
was taken

00:25:25.760 --> 00:25:27.160
and Mr. Bang.

00:25:27.960 --> 00:25:28.280
Sure.

00:25:28.280 --> 00:25:28.880
Okay.

00:25:29.440 --> 00:25:30.500
Congratulations.

00:25:31.360 --> 00:25:31.960
Come on.

00:25:32.120 --> 00:25:33.200
Go up, Mr. Bang.

00:25:33.440 --> 00:25:33.920
Here.

00:25:35.960 --> 00:25:36.520
Come on.

00:25:39.120 --> 00:25:39.600
Okay.

00:25:39.680 --> 00:25:41.280
Now

00:25:41.280 --> 00:25:43.200
to enjoy our dance.

00:25:43.400 --> 00:25:43.960
Please sit down.

00:25:43.960 --> 00:25:45.820
We're going to spend money later.

00:25:46.480 --> 00:25:47.240
Okay.

00:25:48.360 --> 00:25:49.690
Let me fill it up for you.

00:25:50.840 --> 00:25:51.520
The auction tonight

00:25:51.520 --> 00:25:52.720
Good work, everyone.

00:25:53.520 --> 00:25:54.440
Mr. Bang.

00:25:54.920 --> 00:25:56.440
This year's money

00:25:56.520 --> 00:25:58.450
is three times as much as last year.

00:25:58.600 --> 00:26:00.760
Mr. Bang is brilliant.

00:26:00.920 --> 00:26:02.840
You came up with a blind photography box

00:26:02.840 --> 00:26:04.480
to raise the money.

00:26:05.040 --> 00:26:05.720
As usual.

00:26:05.960 --> 00:26:07.200
40% of the Chamber of Commerce.

00:26:07.200 --> 00:26:08.520
I'll send it to you

00:26:08.520 --> 00:26:09.640
I'll send it to you.

00:26:09.960 --> 00:26:10.640
Good job.

00:26:17.960 --> 00:26:18.560
Coach Xue.

00:26:19.200 --> 00:26:20.200
Didn't you say this place

00:26:20.200 --> 00:26:21.480
is specially prepared

00:26:21.480 --> 00:26:22.880
for me and Lord Xu?

00:26:23.120 --> 00:26:24.200
Yes.

00:26:24.520 --> 00:26:25.920
Lord Xu is busy.

00:26:25.920 --> 00:26:26.980
He hasn't come yet.

00:26:27.200 --> 00:26:28.280
Please enjoy.

00:26:39.120 --> 00:26:40.920
Mr. Xu, you are finally here.

00:26:41.200 --> 00:26:42.200
Chairman Fang

00:26:42.200 --> 00:26:43.260
is waiting for you.

00:26:48.200 --> 00:26:50.040
Li, it's been three years.

00:26:50.680 --> 00:26:51.440
How are you?

00:26:51.640 --> 00:26:52.640
I'm fine.

00:26:52.760 --> 00:26:54.840
I am now the chairman of the Chamber of Commerce.

00:26:54.840 --> 00:26:56.200
I heard that after you returned to Chang'an,

00:26:56.200 --> 00:26:57.600
after you came back to Chang'an.

00:26:57.600 --> 00:26:59.160
and survived.

00:26:59.480 --> 00:27:00.520
From now on,

00:27:00.680 --> 00:27:02.400
I'm going to get married

00:27:02.400 --> 00:27:03.800
and live a peaceful life.

00:27:03.880 --> 00:27:06.120
We'll protect each other from now on.

00:27:06.640 --> 00:27:08.200
I will protect you.

00:27:16.200 --> 00:27:18.240
It's indeed a prosperous world.

00:27:20.520 --> 00:27:21.680
So lively.

00:27:29.160 --> 00:27:30.840
The three biggest lanterns

00:27:31.360 --> 00:27:32.520
Mr. Fang

00:27:32.640 --> 00:27:34.640
will light the lantern for you.

00:27:35.480 --> 00:27:36.280
Okay.

00:27:36.480 --> 00:27:37.400
OK. OK.

00:27:40.640 --> 00:27:42.040
Anle Chamber of Commerce

00:27:42.200 --> 00:27:43.840
to pray for peace

00:27:44.000 --> 00:27:45.680
I pray for peace and prosperity

00:27:45.680 --> 00:27:46.960
and give back to the people.

00:27:46.960 --> 00:27:48.020
Wish you good luck.

00:27:49.120 --> 00:27:52.040
The money-sprinkling ceremony officially begins.

00:27:52.040 --> 00:27:52.440
Okay.

00:27:52.440 --> 00:27:53.440
Hurry up.

00:27:53.960 --> 00:27:55.160
The first light is on.

00:27:55.240 --> 00:27:56.370
and have no worries.

00:28:09.680 --> 00:28:10.920
The second light is on.

00:28:10.920 --> 00:28:12.320
Blessings and longevity

00:28:20.040 --> 00:28:20.960
Hua Xiaochi

00:28:21.440 --> 00:28:23.120
How dare you come here?

00:28:30.640 --> 00:28:31.840
The third light is on.

00:28:32.000 --> 00:28:32.960
The sun is on

00:28:58.360 --> 00:28:59.200
It's okay.

00:28:59.440 --> 00:28:59.960
Move!

00:29:01.480 --> 00:29:02.940
Hua Xiaochi, you pervert!

00:29:02.960 --> 00:29:03.960
How dare you

00:29:04.240 --> 00:29:05.200
How dare you

00:29:05.880 --> 00:29:07.240
to Chairman Bang?

00:29:09.960 --> 00:29:11.640
Mr. Bang.

00:29:13.160 --> 00:29:15.000
I’m the chairman of Anle Chamber of Commerce.

00:29:15.000 --> 00:29:15.680
Fang Li.

00:29:15.880 --> 00:29:16.480
Guards!

00:29:16.920 --> 00:29:17.960
Arrest her!

00:29:18.440 --> 00:29:18.960
Yes.

00:29:21.720 --> 00:29:23.200
Don't you care about

00:29:23.680 --> 00:29:25.140
what happened last night?

00:29:26.120 --> 00:29:26.960
Last night...

00:29:29.640 --> 00:29:30.880
What are you talking about?

00:29:30.880 --> 00:29:31.440
Get him.

00:29:33.280 --> 00:29:34.480
Are you angry?

00:29:34.520 --> 00:29:36.120
I'm not responsible for you.

00:29:45.280 --> 00:29:45.880
Shut up!

00:29:46.040 --> 00:29:46.760
Get him!

00:29:48.840 --> 00:29:50.360
I didn't expect

00:29:50.960 --> 00:29:53.520
you turned your back on me.

00:29:54.200 --> 00:29:54.840
I...

00:29:54.960 --> 00:29:56.600
How could I do such a thing?

00:29:57.880 --> 00:29:58.720
No way.

00:30:00.200 --> 00:30:01.400
Really?

00:30:02.720 --> 00:30:03.680
What are you waiting for?

00:30:03.680 --> 00:30:04.280
Go get him.

00:30:04.480 --> 00:30:04.960
Yes.

00:30:06.600 --> 00:30:07.040
Move!

00:30:13.360 --> 00:30:14.160
Shut up!

00:30:22.720 --> 00:30:24.360
You picked up a lot of money.

00:30:32.040 --> 00:30:33.040
You scared me.

00:30:36.920 --> 00:30:38.920
Xu Ziqi who was stabbed a thousand times

00:30:38.920 --> 00:30:41.650
He knows the chairman of the Chamber of Commerce?

00:30:42.440 --> 00:30:43.920
Oh no.

00:30:45.200 --> 00:30:46.440
This is bad.

00:30:47.480 --> 00:30:48.640
I've offended him.

00:30:48.920 --> 00:30:50.920
How can he live in Chang'an?

00:30:55.480 --> 00:30:59.740
If you want to establish a career and become the best female merchant in Tang,

00:31:01.440 --> 00:31:04.520
I have to work hard.

00:31:05.960 --> 00:31:06.880
connections.

00:31:08.440 --> 00:31:09.840
[Store]

00:31:10.880 --> 00:31:12.360
Price.

00:31:18.440 --> 00:31:19.520
My capital.

00:31:20.280 --> 00:31:21.200
My money!

00:31:26.760 --> 00:31:28.400
You crazy girl.

00:31:31.160 --> 00:31:32.440
I made you upset.

00:31:32.880 --> 00:31:33.480
It's okay.

00:31:33.880 --> 00:31:35.680
Nothing serious happened to me.

00:31:35.680 --> 00:31:37.760
I'll drink with you tonight.

00:31:38.360 --> 00:31:38.960
This kind of thing

00:31:38.960 --> 00:31:40.240
never happen again.

00:31:41.400 --> 00:31:41.920
Okay.

00:31:50.720 --> 00:31:51.680
My money!

00:31:53.720 --> 00:31:54.480
My money!

00:31:59.480 --> 00:32:00.760
The money is gone.

00:32:01.600 --> 00:32:03.120
It's all their fault.

00:32:04.120 --> 00:32:05.850
I'd better stay away from them.

00:32:07.960 --> 00:32:08.520
You

00:32:08.680 --> 00:32:09.520
accompany Jin'er

00:32:09.520 --> 00:32:11.400
to Lord Xu and Chairman Fang's room

00:32:11.400 --> 00:32:12.660
and bring some fruits.

00:32:13.360 --> 00:32:13.760
Okay.

00:32:16.520 --> 00:32:18.760
Mr. Bang, Mr. Xu.

00:32:32.680 --> 00:32:34.520
Okay.

00:32:34.520 --> 00:32:35.200
Okay.

00:32:37.680 --> 00:32:38.680
Great.

00:32:38.680 --> 00:32:39.960
Beautiful

00:32:39.960 --> 00:32:40.640
So nice.

00:32:43.200 --> 00:32:43.720
Husppy

00:32:44.280 --> 00:32:44.720
Yes.

00:32:44.840 --> 00:32:45.680
Go get more wine.

00:32:45.680 --> 00:32:46.410
Yes, my lord.

00:32:48.480 --> 00:32:49.200
Come on, Xu.

00:32:56.120 --> 00:32:57.450
I can't take it anymore.

00:32:57.840 --> 00:32:59.240
I need to rest.

00:32:59.960 --> 00:33:00.690
Take a break.

00:33:16.640 --> 00:33:17.440
I'll come in.

00:33:29.640 --> 00:33:30.280
Mr. Bang.

00:33:30.960 --> 00:33:31.720
I'm Jin'er.

00:33:31.960 --> 00:33:33.420
I brought you some fruits.

00:33:37.880 --> 00:33:38.200
Mr. Fang.

00:33:38.200 --> 00:33:39.000
You scared me.

00:33:44.960 --> 00:33:45.680
Mr. Bang.

00:33:47.160 --> 00:33:47.840
Mr. Bang.

00:33:52.200 --> 00:33:52.920
Mr. Bang.

00:33:56.120 --> 00:33:56.520
Hurry.

00:33:57.440 --> 00:33:58.600
Help me

00:33:58.680 --> 00:33:59.880
back to my room.

00:34:01.840 --> 00:34:02.920
This girl

00:34:03.200 --> 00:34:04.960
is no ordinary person.

00:34:11.880 --> 00:34:13.000
I want to see

00:34:13.080 --> 00:34:14.139
what you want to do.

00:34:44.159 --> 00:34:46.280
I've admired Mr. Fang for a long time.

00:34:47.040 --> 00:34:49.880
This is the only chance I lack.

00:34:50.360 --> 00:34:53.920
If I go with you today,

00:35:04.440 --> 00:35:05.520
Jin'er.

00:35:10.320 --> 00:35:11.080
Come here.

00:35:11.800 --> 00:35:12.840
Come here.

00:35:13.280 --> 00:35:14.920
Wake up, okay?

00:35:15.480 --> 00:35:16.120
Mom.

00:35:17.360 --> 00:35:19.000
If I sleep with him,

00:35:19.760 --> 00:35:20.960
from now on,

00:35:21.520 --> 00:35:23.160
you can only be responsible for me.

00:35:23.160 --> 00:35:24.960
Why are you so confused?

00:35:25.280 --> 00:35:26.640
Does he really like you?

00:35:26.800 --> 00:35:27.400
You are...

00:35:28.360 --> 00:35:28.840
You need

00:35:28.840 --> 00:35:30.360
to force him

00:35:30.440 --> 00:35:31.840
to force him to marry you?

00:35:32.400 --> 00:35:33.200
Stop looking.

00:35:33.280 --> 00:35:33.810
Let's go.

00:35:34.240 --> 00:35:34.840
Hurry up.

00:35:35.040 --> 00:35:36.000
Let's go.

00:35:36.040 --> 00:35:37.480
Hurry up. Stop looking.

00:35:37.840 --> 00:35:38.600
Come on.

00:35:38.920 --> 00:35:39.450
Hurry up.

00:35:41.120 --> 00:35:42.440
Come out!

00:35:46.280 --> 00:35:48.320
Stop looking. What are you looking at?

00:35:48.320 --> 00:35:48.850
Let's go.

00:35:49.400 --> 00:35:50.240
Let's go.

00:35:57.640 --> 00:35:59.400
This woman is too...

00:36:00.320 --> 00:36:02.400
Money is more reliable.

00:36:06.000 --> 00:36:07.080
What is this?

00:36:13.040 --> 00:36:14.480
It's so beautiful.

00:36:16.240 --> 00:36:17.800
He's holding fireworks.

00:36:19.280 --> 00:36:20.960
The standard of fireworks in the capital

00:36:20.960 --> 00:36:21.760
Not bad.

00:36:26.560 --> 00:36:28.400
Twin Dragons.

00:36:35.040 --> 00:36:36.240
Alert!

00:36:36.400 --> 00:36:37.640
Emergency muster!

00:36:40.560 --> 00:36:41.160
Let's go.

00:36:41.920 --> 00:36:42.450
Let's go.

00:36:52.080 --> 00:36:53.040
Search everywhere.

00:36:53.040 --> 00:36:53.480
Yes.

00:37:10.960 --> 00:37:11.480
Boss.

00:37:12.320 --> 00:37:13.120
Boss, wake up.

00:37:15.240 --> 00:37:15.760
Boss.

00:37:16.040 --> 00:37:17.500
Where's your signal bomb?

00:37:25.840 --> 00:37:27.160
Search all rooms.

00:37:27.440 --> 00:37:29.280
All suspects will be investigated.

00:37:29.280 --> 00:37:29.920
Yes.

00:37:32.640 --> 00:37:33.480
Guard patrol!

00:37:33.560 --> 00:37:35.490
Irrelevant people, please leave.

00:37:40.840 --> 00:37:41.960
The blanket is not covered.

00:37:41.960 --> 00:37:43.290
What if you catch a cold?

00:37:45.320 --> 00:37:47.240
All the delinquents cooperate with the Imperial Guards

00:37:47.240 --> 00:37:49.000
to check all the people in Pingkang.

00:37:49.000 --> 00:37:50.120
Check all rooms.

00:37:50.400 --> 00:37:51.640
All suspicious people, check them. Yes, sir.

00:37:51.640 --> 00:37:52.160
Yes.

00:37:54.080 --> 00:37:54.800
Sir!

00:37:55.960 --> 00:37:56.600
My Lord!

00:37:59.320 --> 00:37:59.960
My Lord!

00:38:01.240 --> 00:38:01.880
My Lord!

00:38:03.080 --> 00:38:03.800
My Lord!

00:38:07.880 --> 00:38:08.400
My Lord!

00:38:10.080 --> 00:38:10.720
My Lord!

00:38:12.640 --> 00:38:13.300
Where is he?

00:38:13.520 --> 00:38:15.120
My lord, why are you here?

00:38:15.520 --> 00:38:17.000
I didn't even cover my quilt.

00:38:17.000 --> 00:38:18.440
What if you catch a cold?

00:38:38.600 --> 00:38:39.400
Hey! Hey! Hey!

00:38:39.600 --> 00:38:40.060
This...

00:38:46.640 --> 00:38:47.100
This...

00:38:48.360 --> 00:38:49.280
You witch!

00:38:49.480 --> 00:38:50.040
How dare you

00:38:50.040 --> 00:38:51.000
my lord's innocence.
