WEBVTT

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:56.479
What are you doing here?

00:01:56.479 --> 00:01:56.940
Get out.

00:02:05.160 --> 00:02:08.360
Why did he go to the restaurant? He went to the restaurant.

00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:09.440
What restaurant?

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:13.680
I saw you and Husppy

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:14.960
from the restaurant.

00:02:23.320 --> 00:02:23.960
Sir.

00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:27.079
There's no tea in your room.

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:29.840
Why do you

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:33.200
on your body?

00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:42.340
You won't admit it if you go there.

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:44.140
It's not a guilty conscience.

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:45.520
What is it?

00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:47.800
Let me guess.

00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:52.800
Did you come to see me?

00:02:56.920 --> 00:02:59.240
I'm not telling you about my trip to the restaurant.

00:02:59.240 --> 00:03:00.640
I'm afraid you'll do this

00:03:00.960 --> 00:03:02.120
because you're obsessed with me.

00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:03.480
I went there for you.

00:03:04.320 --> 00:03:05.640
I was so happy.

00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:11.040
I'm so happy

00:03:11.520 --> 00:03:13.320
I'm crazy for you.

00:03:14.320 --> 00:03:15.920
Calm down.

00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:20.240
I can't calm down.

00:03:20.520 --> 00:03:21.120
Sir.

00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:24.920
Do you know how handsome you are?

00:03:26.079 --> 00:03:26.640
Sir.

00:03:27.240 --> 00:03:27.920
Do you know

00:03:28.800 --> 00:03:30.320
You're so rich.

00:03:31.520 --> 00:03:32.079
Sir.

00:03:32.800 --> 00:03:35.520
Do you know how talented you are?

00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:37.360
I know.

00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:40.079
This is why all the women in Chang'an

00:03:40.079 --> 00:03:41.079
in Chang'an.

00:03:42.480 --> 00:03:43.120
But now,

00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:46.100
Please control yourself.

00:03:53.800 --> 00:03:54.600
Sir! Sir! Sir!

00:03:59.320 --> 00:03:59.920
Chairman!

00:04:00.640 --> 00:04:04.520
We're meant to be.

00:04:05.040 --> 00:04:06.120
Destiny?

00:04:06.800 --> 00:04:07.400
Sir.

00:04:08.240 --> 00:04:10.240
I made this mistake

00:04:10.520 --> 00:04:12.040
to meet you.

00:04:13.360 --> 00:04:13.960
Chairman.

00:04:14.360 --> 00:04:17.360
Let's go to the top of our lives together.

00:04:18.040 --> 00:04:18.519
Top.

00:04:19.120 --> 00:04:20.079
Top?

00:04:22.320 --> 00:04:23.450
Look, Mr. Chairman.

00:04:23.560 --> 00:04:25.200
I'm smart in business.

00:04:25.760 --> 00:04:27.000
I built Noble Lady Street

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:29.760
to build Noble Lady Street

00:04:29.760 --> 00:04:31.820
the most popular commercial street.

00:04:32.080 --> 00:04:33.560
You are the chairman of the Chamber of Commerce.

00:04:33.560 --> 00:04:35.120
I'm an expert in business.

00:04:35.680 --> 00:04:36.810
If we work together,

00:04:37.120 --> 00:04:39.240
we'll reach the peak of our life.

00:04:41.880 --> 00:04:42.800
A woman

00:04:43.560 --> 00:04:45.320
is too close to the Chamber of Commerce.

00:04:45.320 --> 00:04:46.980
with the Chamber of Commerce.

00:04:50.440 --> 00:04:51.300
You scoundrel.

00:04:51.320 --> 00:04:52.800
Don't be so rude to my lord.

00:04:57.080 --> 00:04:58.760
Chairman Bang is yours now.

00:04:58.760 --> 00:05:00.200
From now on, it's mine.

00:05:03.880 --> 00:05:06.000
No, Lord Bang belongs to everyone.

00:05:06.080 --> 00:05:06.800
It's ours!

00:05:58.360 --> 00:05:59.200
Bastard!

00:05:59.520 --> 00:06:01.320
Ever since I met Hua Xiaochi,

00:06:01.560 --> 00:06:03.360
I haven't slept well for a day.

00:06:06.120 --> 00:06:08.640
How could I say that to her today?

00:06:28.480 --> 00:06:30.200
Calm down.

00:06:32.880 --> 00:06:33.880
Calm down.

00:06:35.760 --> 00:06:37.440
I need to review.

00:06:38.120 --> 00:06:39.520
I came to Chang'an

00:06:40.680 --> 00:06:41.960
I was poor.

00:06:42.320 --> 00:06:43.580
I have no one to rely on.

00:06:43.680 --> 00:06:44.760
Bare-handed.

00:06:45.880 --> 00:06:47.120
How can I do that?

00:06:47.200 --> 00:06:49.060
the best female merchant in Tang?

00:06:51.880 --> 00:06:52.960
There are

00:06:53.880 --> 00:06:55.440
in the middle.

00:07:03.120 --> 00:07:05.440
Based on all conditions,

00:07:08.200 --> 00:07:09.000
First,

00:07:10.320 --> 00:07:12.520
Knowing the room and separating hatred

00:07:13.760 --> 00:07:14.960
Second,

00:07:16.760 --> 00:07:18.490
Let's make a fortune together.

00:07:19.880 --> 00:07:20.680
Three steps.

00:07:21.560 --> 00:07:25.020
[He's the one who got married.] [He's the one who got married.]

00:07:26.680 --> 00:07:28.200
But yesterday,

00:07:29.120 --> 00:07:31.520
didn't acknowledge my business talent.

00:07:43.120 --> 00:07:45.200
Is it not enough?

00:07:48.560 --> 00:07:52.000
Looks like we need to find a good job.

00:07:53.120 --> 00:07:54.760
Beauty is reliable.

00:07:57.520 --> 00:07:59.440
But the place has changed.

00:07:59.880 --> 00:08:01.610
the preferences have changed.

00:08:03.520 --> 00:08:04.850
I need to be a detective.

00:08:06.440 --> 00:08:07.900
Where can I be a detective?

00:08:08.440 --> 00:08:09.800
There are many girls.

00:08:15.880 --> 00:08:17.640
I know.

00:08:21.560 --> 00:08:22.690
Where are you going?

00:08:25.080 --> 00:08:25.940
Pingkang Fang.

00:08:26.880 --> 00:08:28.940
I knew you wouldn’t go to a good place.

00:08:32.200 --> 00:08:34.080
My lord, the sedan chair is ready.

00:08:34.120 --> 00:08:35.440
Where are we going today?

00:08:35.440 --> 00:08:36.299
Pingkang Fang.

00:08:37.200 --> 00:08:40.440
Why did your lord go to such a place?

00:08:40.440 --> 00:08:42.280
He's going to work.

00:08:42.320 --> 00:08:43.450
Where are you going?

00:08:43.679 --> 00:08:44.680
Business.

00:08:52.840 --> 00:08:54.800
President, I was just kidding.

00:08:55.320 --> 00:08:56.280
You and those

00:08:56.440 --> 00:08:59.440
who went to Pingkang Fang

00:08:59.800 --> 00:09:00.600
is different.

00:09:01.320 --> 00:09:02.850
The adults are so mad at you.

00:09:02.920 --> 00:09:04.800
Shut up!

00:09:07.560 --> 00:09:08.420
Get on the sedan

00:09:11.080 --> 00:09:12.680
On the way. Get in.

00:09:14.080 --> 00:09:14.800
But sir,

00:09:15.440 --> 00:09:17.800
Don't you think this sedan chair

00:09:18.440 --> 00:09:19.200
a little...

00:09:19.680 --> 00:09:20.480
It's small.

00:09:21.600 --> 00:09:22.000
Husppy

00:09:22.080 --> 00:09:22.440
Yes.

00:09:22.800 --> 00:09:24.200
Get a double sedan chair.

00:09:25.200 --> 00:09:27.130
I don't want to get too close to her.

00:09:31.560 --> 00:09:33.220
Watch out, my lord! Watch out!

00:09:38.680 --> 00:09:39.480
Rise the sedan

00:09:52.600 --> 00:09:54.960
Why are you going to Pingkang Bang?

00:09:56.480 --> 00:09:57.480
Stay away from me.

00:09:58.840 --> 00:10:00.560
The sedan chair is only this big.

00:10:00.560 --> 00:10:01.440
It's not far.

00:10:07.800 --> 00:10:08.600
Mr. Chairman.

00:10:08.600 --> 00:10:10.560
Did you fall for my sweet smile?

00:10:10.680 --> 00:10:11.680
by my sweet smile?

00:10:14.160 --> 00:10:15.020
I don't believe

00:10:15.720 --> 00:10:17.440
you have the beauty of my smile.

00:10:17.440 --> 00:10:18.560
Smile then.

00:10:20.160 --> 00:10:20.960
Let's go.

00:10:28.560 --> 00:10:29.280
Well...

00:10:30.080 --> 00:10:33.040
The chairman's cold face is very handsome.

00:10:33.480 --> 00:10:36.440
If you smile, you'll ruin this beauty.

00:10:40.040 --> 00:10:41.040
What do you think?

00:10:55.160 --> 00:10:55.960
Mr. Chairman.

00:10:55.960 --> 00:10:56.840
I'm here

00:10:56.960 --> 00:10:59.080
to share my beauty skills with you.

00:10:59.800 --> 00:11:01.320
Then why are you here?

00:11:05.040 --> 00:11:06.680
Where do you want to go?

00:11:06.720 --> 00:11:08.080
to report to you?

00:11:09.440 --> 00:11:12.840
Aren't you going to protect me?

00:11:14.400 --> 00:11:15.320
Why?

00:11:16.920 --> 00:11:18.920
Do you really think you can win his heart

00:11:18.920 --> 00:11:20.560
you can win his heart?

00:11:22.440 --> 00:11:23.280
Sir.

00:11:23.440 --> 00:11:25.080
Don't you think she's scary? She's scary.

00:11:25.080 --> 00:11:26.080
I'm so scared.

00:11:26.200 --> 00:11:26.960
Hua Xiaochi.

00:11:27.600 --> 00:11:29.480
Aren't you looking for your Mr. Right?

00:11:29.480 --> 00:11:30.200
Why are you here again?

00:11:30.200 --> 00:11:31.530
in a willow alley again?

00:11:31.800 --> 00:11:32.920
Mr. Bang.

00:11:34.280 --> 00:11:35.600
Mr. Bang is here too.

00:11:36.400 --> 00:11:38.200
And I'm here for business.

00:11:38.800 --> 00:11:40.200
I'm here to check on you. I'm here to check on you.

00:11:40.200 --> 00:11:41.460
You won't understand.

00:11:43.680 --> 00:11:45.680
Li, why are you here?

00:11:46.840 --> 00:11:47.840
I have work to do.

00:11:49.320 --> 00:11:49.720
Yes.

00:11:50.320 --> 00:11:53.180
Mr. Bang said he came to Pingkang Fang for business.

00:11:56.440 --> 00:11:56.920
right?

00:11:57.160 --> 00:11:57.560
Li,

00:11:58.200 --> 00:12:00.200
You have work to do in Pingkang Fang.

00:12:01.840 --> 00:12:02.970
It’s confidential.

00:12:03.320 --> 00:12:04.520
I can't tell you here.

00:12:06.960 --> 00:12:07.960
I have something else to do.

00:12:07.960 --> 00:12:08.820
I'll get going.

00:12:10.080 --> 00:12:11.140
Goodbye, Mr. Bang.

00:12:12.160 --> 00:12:14.020
Aren't you coming in for some tea?

00:12:14.400 --> 00:12:14.920
No.

00:12:17.400 --> 00:12:18.560
Mr. Bang.

00:12:19.040 --> 00:12:22.440
You came all the way to Pingkang Fang.

00:12:24.320 --> 00:12:26.440
Are you here to see me off?

00:12:26.680 --> 00:12:28.480
You wish. You wish.

00:12:28.600 --> 00:12:30.440
Keep your image.

00:12:31.560 --> 00:12:34.160
Xu Ziqi, what are you doing here?

00:12:34.680 --> 00:12:35.080
I...

00:12:37.480 --> 00:12:39.720
I'm here to see if you've done something wrong again.

00:12:39.720 --> 00:12:40.440
Besides,

00:12:40.720 --> 00:12:42.850
you haven't done what you promised me.

00:12:44.200 --> 00:12:46.130
You want me to find you a wife again?

00:12:46.560 --> 00:12:47.040
Fine.

00:12:47.680 --> 00:12:49.810
You should at least cooperate with me.

00:12:51.680 --> 00:12:52.480
Lord Xu,

00:12:53.080 --> 00:12:54.800
If you want a good girl,

00:12:55.320 --> 00:12:56.920
you can't let her help you.

00:12:57.560 --> 00:12:59.440
This evil behavior

00:12:59.920 --> 00:13:00.800
can be trusted.

00:13:10.040 --> 00:13:10.840
Miss Jin'er.

00:13:11.040 --> 00:13:12.320
You have a point.

00:13:14.400 --> 00:13:15.560
Let's go.

00:13:27.200 --> 00:13:27.680
Come on.

00:13:35.680 --> 00:13:36.400
Come on.

00:13:53.960 --> 00:13:55.440
Miss Jin'er's hands

00:13:56.600 --> 00:13:58.560
is so beautiful.

00:13:58.960 --> 00:14:00.490
You're indeed the top star.

00:14:01.680 --> 00:14:02.680
Miss Jin'er.

00:14:03.480 --> 00:14:07.320
Lord Xu is a reliable man.

00:14:08.080 --> 00:14:09.080
Be a good man.

00:14:12.160 --> 00:14:12.840
What?

00:14:15.960 --> 00:14:16.360
You...

00:14:18.960 --> 00:14:19.840
Lord Xu.

00:14:19.840 --> 00:14:22.480
I just want a successful woman like you

00:14:22.680 --> 00:14:24.160
beautiful and rich.

00:14:24.440 --> 00:14:26.200
Do you also want

00:14:26.200 --> 00:14:27.440
a strong boy

00:14:27.480 --> 00:14:29.340
to rely on for the rest of his life.

00:14:29.840 --> 00:14:31.800
You can’t stay

00:14:32.320 --> 00:14:33.840
for the rest of your life.

00:14:36.320 --> 00:14:37.800
Miss Hua is right.

00:14:38.600 --> 00:14:39.720
What nonsense are you talking about?

00:14:39.720 --> 00:14:40.320
It doesn't make sense.

00:14:40.320 --> 00:14:41.850
What are you talking about?

00:14:43.960 --> 00:14:44.720
Baby.

00:14:44.720 --> 00:14:45.780
Listen to me first.

00:14:48.560 --> 00:14:49.920
Miss Hua is right.

00:14:50.320 --> 00:14:52.780
But you forgot the most important question.

00:14:52.800 --> 00:14:54.440
Everyone in Chang'an knows

00:14:55.080 --> 00:14:57.040
the man Jin'er loves

00:14:57.480 --> 00:14:58.800
It's Chairman Bang.

00:15:02.560 --> 00:15:04.920
Mr. Bang will be with me.

00:15:05.200 --> 00:15:07.400
I think Mr. Xu and you are a good match.

00:15:07.600 --> 00:15:08.800
A pair of Chang'an.

00:15:14.400 --> 00:15:15.330
Come on. Come on.

00:15:17.480 --> 00:15:18.320
Xu Ziqi.

00:15:18.600 --> 00:15:20.160
I'll help you find a wife. Okay. Okay.

00:15:20.160 --> 00:15:20.480
Hit me.

00:15:20.480 --> 00:15:21.740
You have to protect me.

00:15:23.680 --> 00:15:24.920
Drag him out and beat him.

00:15:24.920 --> 00:15:25.600
Yes.

00:15:25.960 --> 00:15:26.720
You...

00:15:27.440 --> 00:15:28.480
Don't.

00:15:28.560 --> 00:15:29.320
Don't.

00:15:30.080 --> 00:15:32.680
Xu Ziqi, I'm helping you find a wife.

00:15:37.840 --> 00:15:38.720
Let go of me!

00:15:48.040 --> 00:15:49.280
Xu Ziqi!

00:15:56.680 --> 00:15:58.800
Move! Move! Move!

00:16:09.800 --> 00:16:10.560
Are you okay?

00:16:10.600 --> 00:16:11.840
Don't scare me.

00:16:12.160 --> 00:16:12.890
Hua Xiaochi.

00:16:13.440 --> 00:16:14.770
Are you out of your mind?

00:16:15.440 --> 00:16:16.840
I was saving you.

00:16:17.080 --> 00:16:19.040
You almost had a stitch.

00:16:19.400 --> 00:16:20.920
What happened to you?

00:16:21.160 --> 00:16:22.480
I don't know what's wrong with me.

00:16:22.480 --> 00:16:23.920
I've been practicing martial arts for 16 years.

00:16:23.920 --> 00:16:26.250
I've never encountered such a situation.

00:16:26.560 --> 00:16:29.080
Do you feel suffocated

00:16:29.080 --> 00:16:30.920
I can't lift it up at once.

00:16:32.040 --> 00:16:33.840
Are you dizzy?

00:16:33.960 --> 00:16:35.280
Spin the sky

00:16:35.400 --> 00:16:37.530
I feel like I'm going to faint anytime.

00:16:38.480 --> 00:16:41.320
Do you feel chest tightness and shortness of breath?

00:16:41.320 --> 00:16:42.440
A big rock

00:16:42.440 --> 00:16:44.720
on the chest.

00:16:45.920 --> 00:16:47.080
Are you angry?

00:16:48.280 --> 00:16:50.160
Who do you think made me angry?

00:16:52.160 --> 00:16:53.560
I guess

00:16:58.560 --> 00:17:03.160
I guess you're angry that you're too ordinary

00:17:03.400 --> 00:17:05.260
that you can't marry a rich woman.

00:17:11.760 --> 00:17:12.599
Are you okay?

00:17:13.400 --> 00:17:14.440
Where are you touching?

00:17:14.440 --> 00:17:16.640
I think you have chest tightness and breath.

00:17:16.640 --> 00:17:17.680
I can help you.

00:17:18.240 --> 00:17:18.720
Stop!

00:17:21.119 --> 00:17:21.920
I'm fine.

00:17:29.200 --> 00:17:30.440
I just want to see

00:17:30.840 --> 00:17:31.960
Are you really recovered?

00:17:31.960 --> 00:17:32.840
It seems true.

00:17:32.880 --> 00:17:34.880
I'll leave if there's nothing else.

00:17:36.360 --> 00:17:37.220
Hua Xiao Zheng.

00:17:40.640 --> 00:17:42.640
I'll give you one last chance.

00:17:42.920 --> 00:17:44.640
to tie the red thread for me.

00:17:45.120 --> 00:17:45.960
Otherwise,

00:17:46.720 --> 00:17:48.040
Just cash it to me.

00:17:48.400 --> 00:17:49.260
That's enough.

00:17:49.520 --> 00:17:51.680
100 taels of gold.

00:17:52.280 --> 00:17:53.440
One coin is missing.

00:17:53.600 --> 00:17:55.680
I'll kick you out of Chang'an

00:17:56.120 --> 00:17:58.200
I'll kick you out of Chang'an myself.

00:17:58.600 --> 00:17:59.760
100 taels.

00:17:59.920 --> 00:18:01.360
Are you blackmailing me?

00:18:02.200 --> 00:18:04.000
Yes, it's blackmail.

00:18:05.000 --> 00:18:06.360
The rules of you coming and going

00:18:06.360 --> 00:18:09.290
It's just that you're not kind and I'm not righteous.

00:18:09.360 --> 00:18:11.440
I'm not convinced.

00:18:13.240 --> 00:18:13.960
Really?

00:18:15.440 --> 00:18:18.040
I find I can't follow your rules.

00:18:18.160 --> 00:18:20.920
So just follow my rules.

00:18:21.480 --> 00:18:22.920
This is your last chance.

00:18:22.960 --> 00:18:23.960
Or

00:18:24.280 --> 00:18:26.240
It's 200 taels.

00:18:27.680 --> 00:18:28.920
Any problem?

00:18:30.920 --> 00:18:32.920
I think it's fair.

00:18:32.960 --> 00:18:34.760
Okay. Deal.

00:18:40.360 --> 00:18:41.760
Are you threatening me?

00:18:45.280 --> 00:18:46.840
I don't feel well.

00:18:47.440 --> 00:18:48.770
I have chest tightness.

00:18:49.200 --> 00:18:50.440
I can't breathe.

00:18:57.240 --> 00:18:59.240
My lord, it's late.

00:18:59.440 --> 00:19:01.040
Why don't you go back to your room and study?

00:19:01.040 --> 00:19:02.770
Don't hurt your precious eyes.

00:19:03.920 --> 00:19:04.850
It's quiet here.

00:19:05.640 --> 00:19:06.880
The room is noisy.

00:19:07.920 --> 00:19:08.680
By the way,

00:19:10.120 --> 00:19:10.960
I asked you

00:19:11.440 --> 00:19:12.360
for dinner.

00:19:12.920 --> 00:19:13.920
As you ordered.

00:19:14.040 --> 00:19:15.200
20 dishes in total.

00:19:15.680 --> 00:19:16.480
Are you ready?

00:19:16.640 --> 00:19:17.240
Yes.

00:19:23.400 --> 00:19:23.960
My lord.

00:19:25.920 --> 00:19:27.520
Yes, tonight.

00:19:27.760 --> 00:19:29.440
Who is coming?

00:19:29.760 --> 00:19:30.600
Just me.

00:19:33.120 --> 00:19:33.920
One person.

00:19:34.440 --> 00:19:35.400
20 dishes.

00:19:36.480 --> 00:19:37.880
I want to change my taste.

00:19:41.760 --> 00:19:43.240
Mr. Bang, I'm home.

00:19:46.480 --> 00:19:47.480
Hello. Hello.

00:19:49.000 --> 00:19:49.680
Report!

00:19:50.240 --> 00:19:51.360
Braised pigeon.

00:19:51.680 --> 00:19:52.600
Yulan soup.

00:19:53.000 --> 00:19:54.040
Feels good

00:19:54.520 --> 00:19:56.050
Chicken shredded cucumber

00:19:56.160 --> 00:19:57.440
Come on. Come on.

00:19:57.440 --> 00:19:58.040
Go on.

00:19:58.920 --> 00:20:00.360
Longjing bamboo mushroom.

00:20:00.360 --> 00:20:01.680
Fragrant apple.

00:20:02.280 --> 00:20:03.410
Snow Mountain Plum.

00:20:03.640 --> 00:20:04.900
Here you go. Thank you.

00:20:11.200 --> 00:20:14.160
You're eating a lot, Mr. Chairman. Let's go.

00:20:16.000 --> 00:20:16.760
Let's go.

00:20:23.120 --> 00:20:23.920
Nothing.

00:20:24.280 --> 00:20:26.720
These are the most famous food in Chang'an.

00:20:32.120 --> 00:20:33.280
Take your time.

00:20:34.680 --> 00:20:36.440
Have you had dinner?

00:20:36.760 --> 00:20:38.120
I had three pancakes.

00:20:38.280 --> 00:20:39.040
Are you full?

00:20:39.440 --> 00:20:40.680
I ate three pancakes.

00:20:41.600 --> 00:20:43.120
I only had two pancakes.

00:20:43.680 --> 00:20:46.140
She'll be stuffed to death if she eats three.

00:20:47.280 --> 00:20:48.440
I'm a little full.

00:20:49.200 --> 00:20:50.960
Enjoy. I'm going back to my room.

00:20:50.960 --> 00:20:51.960
See you tomorrow.

00:20:59.040 --> 00:21:00.040
I told you to stop.

00:21:00.360 --> 00:21:01.290
Keep reporting.

00:21:01.440 --> 00:21:01.960
Louder.

00:21:03.040 --> 00:21:04.400
Almond Buddha Hand.

00:21:04.760 --> 00:21:06.200
Tofu.

00:21:06.640 --> 00:21:08.100
Golden Steamed Dumpling.

00:21:08.200 --> 00:21:09.640
Shrimp.

00:21:10.040 --> 00:21:11.520
Braised Red Shrimp.

00:21:14.760 --> 00:21:15.560
What's wrong?

00:21:15.680 --> 00:21:17.200
Finish this meal today.

00:21:17.440 --> 00:21:19.370
You don't have to find me tomorrow.

00:21:20.760 --> 00:21:22.400
Don't you have dinner?

00:21:31.840 --> 00:21:33.040
I'm hungry.

00:21:34.640 --> 00:21:35.300
I'm hungry.

00:21:35.920 --> 00:21:36.960
Let's get to work.

00:21:39.280 --> 00:21:42.240
I went to the east and west market today.

00:21:42.760 --> 00:21:45.640
I wonder if the city's rouge is good

00:21:46.480 --> 00:21:47.640
You bought so much.

00:21:48.720 --> 00:21:50.040
Let's study it.

00:21:54.000 --> 00:21:55.400
It's not very colourful.

00:21:55.680 --> 00:21:57.940
It's not that good. It's good. It's good.

00:22:00.200 --> 00:22:01.660
Look at this. Look at this.

00:22:03.600 --> 00:22:05.120
It's quite eye-catching.

00:22:12.120 --> 00:22:13.580
The powder has fallen off.

00:22:21.200 --> 00:22:23.600
This is the rouge of Chang'an.

00:22:32.120 --> 00:22:33.480
Coming.

00:22:37.000 --> 00:22:38.480
Come here, everyone.

00:22:38.920 --> 00:22:41.040
Marry him. Marry him.

00:22:41.200 --> 00:22:43.040
Marrying him won't hurt you.

00:22:43.200 --> 00:22:45.000
I won't fall for it if I marry him.

00:22:45.200 --> 00:22:46.280
He's handsome

00:22:46.400 --> 00:22:47.680
He has great limbs.

00:22:47.840 --> 00:22:49.000
Work with love

00:22:49.000 --> 00:22:50.400
Speak with your heart.

00:22:50.480 --> 00:22:52.840
and observe the situation.

00:22:52.960 --> 00:22:54.280
The government's salary

00:22:54.280 --> 00:22:55.960
in the imperial court.

00:22:58.840 --> 00:23:00.840
I heard that Lord Xu has been on a blind date for a long time.

00:23:00.840 --> 00:23:02.200
but he doesn't have a suitable match.

00:23:02.200 --> 00:23:03.600
Is it demanding?

00:23:04.840 --> 00:23:06.960
A little red in the green

00:23:06.960 --> 00:23:09.400
Maybe Lord Xu is waiting for you.

00:23:10.440 --> 00:23:12.440
Do you have any standards?

00:23:12.880 --> 00:23:14.640
Destiny?

00:23:14.840 --> 00:23:16.600
Wonderful.

00:23:20.960 --> 00:23:22.290
I set up this place today

00:23:22.400 --> 00:23:25.480
to fulfill this unparalleled marriage.

00:23:26.160 --> 00:23:28.680
Lord Xu, I don't need to introduce more.

00:23:28.680 --> 00:23:30.280
He is a good man.

00:23:30.440 --> 00:23:31.640
Loyal and loyal.

00:23:31.680 --> 00:23:32.920
with both literature and martial arts.

00:23:32.920 --> 00:23:35.680
Now I want to find a girl who can get along with me.

00:23:35.680 --> 00:23:37.480
to spend the rest of my life with.

00:23:40.920 --> 00:23:41.920
Here is my sincerity.

00:23:41.920 --> 00:23:44.480
I just need to pay for the tea.

00:23:44.920 --> 00:23:46.720
Line up if you want.

00:23:46.920 --> 00:23:49.680
Let's make an appointment to meet Lord Xu.

00:23:49.880 --> 00:23:50.840
Every girl

00:23:50.960 --> 00:23:52.520
have two hours

00:23:52.520 --> 00:23:55.480
to have a private chat with Lord Xu.

00:23:59.920 --> 00:24:01.680
Come on, queue up, girls.

00:24:09.000 --> 00:24:09.840
Come on.

00:24:10.160 --> 00:24:11.240
Thank you, ladies.

00:24:11.240 --> 00:24:12.960
please fill out the information

00:24:12.960 --> 00:24:14.220
during the interview.

00:24:15.040 --> 00:24:16.200
How old are you?

00:24:16.400 --> 00:24:17.920
Is your face oily?

00:24:18.040 --> 00:24:20.040
Do you wash your face in the morning?

00:24:20.040 --> 00:24:21.880
in the morning?

00:24:21.960 --> 00:24:24.240
What kind of cosmetics do you like?

00:24:24.480 --> 00:24:28.240
lipstick, eyebrow brush, the more detailed, the better.

00:24:29.480 --> 00:24:31.200
Put it here. Fill it yourself.

00:24:33.840 --> 00:24:34.880
Xu Ziqi.

00:24:35.200 --> 00:24:37.680
I have to thank you

00:24:37.760 --> 00:24:39.480
for giving me such a good chance.

00:24:39.480 --> 00:24:41.480
to gather all the girls in Chang'an.

00:24:41.920 --> 00:24:43.760
Those who can afford the registration fee

00:24:43.760 --> 00:24:45.440
are free money.

00:24:45.680 --> 00:24:47.480
They have the purchase power.

00:24:49.520 --> 00:24:52.120
Killing two birds with one stone. Killing two birds with one stone.

00:24:52.120 --> 00:24:53.880
I'm so smart.

00:24:57.400 --> 00:24:58.600
Here we go. Here we go.

00:25:05.200 --> 00:25:05.680
Elder Yi.

00:25:05.680 --> 00:25:06.440
Lord Xu.

00:25:07.920 --> 00:25:08.780
Please come in.

00:25:33.960 --> 00:25:35.760
The Oiran election is coming.

00:25:35.920 --> 00:25:37.280
Thank you, Mr. Bang.

00:25:37.920 --> 00:25:39.680
It looks like you've lost some weight.

00:25:39.680 --> 00:25:40.840
It's my duty.

00:25:41.480 --> 00:25:42.880
We should take care of it.

00:25:43.440 --> 00:25:45.440
Besides the selection of the Oiran,

00:25:45.480 --> 00:25:48.440
and your new dowry maid.

00:25:48.440 --> 00:25:49.300
to torture you.

00:25:49.600 --> 00:25:51.280
I saw that the young master fell in love with me.

00:25:51.280 --> 00:25:52.680
I remember

00:25:52.920 --> 00:25:54.440
are also thinner.

00:25:54.920 --> 00:25:56.250
Please investigate it.

00:25:56.280 --> 00:25:58.680
That woman has nothing to do with me.

00:25:59.200 --> 00:26:01.640
I just took her in Chang'an

00:26:01.960 --> 00:26:04.120
so I took her in.

00:26:15.720 --> 00:26:17.360
It's almost lunchtime.

00:26:17.440 --> 00:26:18.840
They're all decorating.

00:26:19.000 --> 00:26:21.040
Why don't you stay for dinner?

00:26:21.680 --> 00:26:22.400
Okay.

00:26:26.120 --> 00:26:27.180
I'm here. I'm here.

00:26:31.880 --> 00:26:32.600
Well...

00:26:34.640 --> 00:26:35.970
Please go to the toilet.

00:27:30.920 --> 00:27:31.920
This is...

00:27:38.720 --> 00:27:40.050
Here you go. Here you go.

00:27:40.840 --> 00:27:41.200
This is yours.

00:27:41.200 --> 00:27:41.800
Thank you.

00:27:44.520 --> 00:27:45.600
Don't worry.

00:27:45.680 --> 00:27:46.280
Thank you.

00:27:50.280 --> 00:27:51.240
Miss Yang.

00:27:51.640 --> 00:27:52.500
Help yourself.

00:27:55.000 --> 00:27:55.640
Miss Yang,

00:27:55.960 --> 00:27:58.240
If you want to go on another blind date with Lord Xu,

00:27:58.240 --> 00:27:59.200
just tell me.

00:27:59.440 --> 00:28:00.440
I'll arrange it for you.

00:28:00.440 --> 00:28:01.520
Don't come here.

00:28:02.400 --> 00:28:04.000
I'm not here for a blind date.

00:28:05.760 --> 00:28:06.920
I'm here for a blind date. Okay.

00:28:06.920 --> 00:28:07.480
This is...

00:28:07.480 --> 00:28:08.240
You...

00:28:08.520 --> 00:28:09.400
in public

00:28:09.400 --> 00:28:11.480
to go on a blind date for the Xu family.

00:28:11.680 --> 00:28:13.000
He's a despicable man.

00:28:14.160 --> 00:28:15.440
What did your lady say?

00:28:15.440 --> 00:28:16.970
She said you're shameless.

00:28:19.200 --> 00:28:20.640
Look at you.

00:28:20.640 --> 00:28:22.120
It was Lord Xu's idea.

00:28:22.400 --> 00:28:24.440
I just did what he wanted.

00:28:25.000 --> 00:28:25.880
Is that true?

00:28:26.680 --> 00:28:28.960
Lord Xu disregards his dignity.

00:28:29.440 --> 00:28:30.960
He's not afraid of death.

00:28:31.520 --> 00:28:33.160
He said Lord Xu is shameless.

00:28:35.120 --> 00:28:36.920
Is this really Lord Xu's wish?

00:28:39.040 --> 00:28:40.200
I have no integrity.

00:28:40.200 --> 00:28:41.600
[and abandon the roots.]

00:28:41.600 --> 00:28:42.720
Shameless!

00:28:43.000 --> 00:28:44.460
Death with heavy profits.

00:28:44.640 --> 00:28:47.700
You're shameless. You'll be punished sooner or later.

00:28:48.120 --> 00:28:50.720
Miss Yang, you're being too harsh.

00:28:53.760 --> 00:28:54.600
Too heavy.

00:29:41.680 --> 00:29:44.200
Lord Wu is so bad at writing.

00:29:46.680 --> 00:29:47.280
I made an appointment

00:29:47.280 --> 00:29:48.360
three days later.

00:29:48.360 --> 00:29:49.680
to go on a blind date with Lord Xu.

00:29:49.680 --> 00:29:51.480
Is it 9 p.m. in four days?

00:29:52.120 --> 00:29:53.640
Although it's not good at 9 p.m.,

00:29:53.640 --> 00:29:54.960
but I've had breakfast.

00:29:54.960 --> 00:29:56.090
It's still swollen.

00:29:56.360 --> 00:29:58.600
But there's no other day.

00:29:58.760 --> 00:30:00.200
It's good to have one seat.

00:30:00.200 --> 00:30:01.200
to have a position.

00:30:01.200 --> 00:30:04.000
This is the most powerful King of Hell in Chang'an.

00:30:16.160 --> 00:30:18.220
A man from the Xu family is proposing.

00:30:18.240 --> 00:30:18.920
Take it.

00:30:19.720 --> 00:30:20.320
Thank you.

00:30:21.440 --> 00:30:22.200
Hua Xiaochi

00:30:23.040 --> 00:30:23.640
This is for you.

00:30:23.640 --> 00:30:24.400
Here you go. Here you go.

00:30:24.400 --> 00:30:25.680
Xu Ziqi is so handsome.

00:30:25.760 --> 00:30:26.890
You can see him soon.

00:30:27.160 --> 00:30:27.680
Yours. Yours.

00:30:27.680 --> 00:30:28.600
I've signed up.

00:30:31.000 --> 00:30:31.520
Thank you.

00:30:31.520 --> 00:30:32.840
Am I that popular?

00:30:34.120 --> 00:30:34.720
Thank you.

00:30:44.960 --> 00:30:46.920
Is your skin dry or oily?

00:30:46.960 --> 00:30:48.160
Can you write it down?

00:30:48.440 --> 00:30:48.960
Okay.

00:30:49.640 --> 00:30:50.240
Thank you.

00:30:51.520 --> 00:30:52.120
Thank you.

00:30:56.840 --> 00:30:57.640
Take care.

00:31:09.240 --> 00:31:10.720
Xu Ziqi.

00:31:10.720 --> 00:31:12.780
I didn't expect you to be so charming.

00:31:15.120 --> 00:31:16.680
Hua Xiaochi, you bastard!

00:31:33.400 --> 00:31:35.130
A hidden weapon flying dagger.

00:31:45.040 --> 00:31:45.970
Don't be afraid.

00:31:46.880 --> 00:31:48.000
You want money?

00:31:58.360 --> 00:31:59.420
What are you doing?

00:32:02.440 --> 00:32:03.960
Xu Ziqi! Xu Ziqi!

00:32:03.960 --> 00:32:04.640
Protect me!

00:32:04.680 --> 00:32:05.740
Someone robbed me.

00:32:06.040 --> 00:32:08.000
He has a hidden weapon flying dagger.

00:32:08.000 --> 00:32:10.160
Hide behind me and let them fly me.

00:32:11.400 --> 00:32:12.520
That makes sense.

00:32:12.520 --> 00:32:13.960
Come on, get down.

00:32:14.200 --> 00:32:14.660
Come on.

00:32:15.760 --> 00:32:17.680
Let go of me. Let go of me. Let go of me.

00:32:17.680 --> 00:32:18.680
Lower your voice.

00:32:22.240 --> 00:32:23.240
I'll stab you now.

00:32:24.880 --> 00:32:25.740
Flying dagger!

00:32:29.200 --> 00:32:29.720
You...

00:32:30.880 --> 00:32:32.160
Xu Ziqi!

00:32:32.160 --> 00:32:33.360
You are a court official.

00:32:33.360 --> 00:32:35.440
to rob a good woman?

00:32:36.200 --> 00:32:37.360
What a fool.

00:32:40.840 --> 00:32:43.360
You...

00:32:44.680 --> 00:32:45.740
Are you robbing me?

00:32:46.160 --> 00:32:47.200
I'll scream.

00:32:47.400 --> 00:32:47.680
I...

00:32:47.920 --> 00:32:48.840
How did you get the money?

00:32:48.840 --> 00:32:50.040
how you got the money?

00:32:52.160 --> 00:32:52.880
Brother.

00:32:53.360 --> 00:32:54.920
I'm helping you find a wife.

00:32:55.640 --> 00:32:56.640
Those girls...

00:32:56.640 --> 00:32:58.570
I won't go on blind dates with them.

00:32:58.840 --> 00:32:59.770
I took the money.

00:33:00.200 --> 00:33:01.060
You took it too.

00:33:01.200 --> 00:33:02.360
Be honest, OK?

00:33:02.960 --> 00:33:04.760
You took the money, not me.

00:33:04.760 --> 00:33:06.200
I didn't say anything.

00:33:07.120 --> 00:33:09.120
I'll give you more.

00:33:09.600 --> 00:33:10.480
Take the money.

00:33:10.680 --> 00:33:11.840
I have to kiss you.

00:33:12.360 --> 00:33:15.040
This is my money at most.

00:33:15.680 --> 00:33:16.740
for my reputation.

00:33:16.880 --> 00:33:18.940
Why did you bury the money in the soil?

00:33:19.240 --> 00:33:20.440
You can't take it with you today.

00:33:20.440 --> 00:33:22.370
I'll dig it with a shovel tomorrow.

00:33:22.920 --> 00:33:23.780
Hua Xiao Zheng.

00:33:23.960 --> 00:33:24.960
You did everything

00:33:24.960 --> 00:33:26.400
for money.

00:33:26.760 --> 00:33:28.290
I just want to make a living.

00:33:28.360 --> 00:33:29.960
I won't give others a way out.

00:33:30.440 --> 00:33:32.840
I'll take the money.

00:33:33.440 --> 00:33:35.680
Finish the rest yourself.

00:33:42.240 --> 00:33:43.440
I took the money.

00:33:44.160 --> 00:33:45.160
What should we do?

00:33:46.040 --> 00:33:47.440
We'll see.

00:33:50.640 --> 00:33:51.200
My money!

00:34:14.000 --> 00:34:15.960
Come on everyone

00:34:17.440 --> 00:34:18.600
Come on.

00:34:21.360 --> 00:34:24.960
You are going on a blind date with Lord Xu tomorrow.

00:34:26.440 --> 00:34:28.320
You only have one chance.

00:34:28.639 --> 00:34:31.920
Beautiful makeup is a guarantee to win.

00:34:32.639 --> 00:34:34.170
A woman who loves her looks.

00:34:34.440 --> 00:34:35.600
In this world,

00:34:35.639 --> 00:34:36.800
in this world

00:34:36.800 --> 00:34:38.920
doesn't care about

00:34:38.960 --> 00:34:40.400
for the man he likes.

00:34:40.880 --> 00:34:42.840
I want a more beautiful face.

00:34:42.880 --> 00:34:44.960
Without the support of cosmetics.

00:34:45.320 --> 00:34:46.400
Good cosmetics

00:34:46.600 --> 00:34:49.159
can make us look more beautiful

00:34:49.159 --> 00:34:50.520
and bad cosmetics

00:34:50.520 --> 00:34:52.960
will make us look pale.

00:34:55.400 --> 00:34:57.760
After 18 hours,

00:34:58.040 --> 00:34:59.240
12 procedures

00:34:59.360 --> 00:35:01.440
Over 300 makeup verification.

00:35:01.960 --> 00:35:03.640
Finally in your questions,

00:35:03.800 --> 00:35:06.280
the 47 cosmetics mentioned

00:35:06.520 --> 00:35:09.880
has been selected.

00:35:10.760 --> 00:35:12.640
What does Red and Black mean?

00:35:12.640 --> 00:35:14.880
Red List is good.

00:35:14.920 --> 00:35:16.800
It's a deal.

00:35:17.440 --> 00:35:20.160
But don't use the blacklist.

00:35:20.320 --> 00:35:22.320
You'll regret it.

00:35:24.440 --> 00:35:27.640
Now I'm sharing the base makeup.

00:35:28.120 --> 00:35:29.760
No.5 on the blacklist.

00:35:30.160 --> 00:35:31.760
Pretty girl's honey powder.

00:35:32.080 --> 00:35:34.080
You're all familiar with it, right?

00:35:34.440 --> 00:35:36.240
Beautiful lady's honey powder.

00:35:38.440 --> 00:35:39.880
Look at the makeup.

00:35:40.400 --> 00:35:42.440
It's unconvincing.

00:35:43.040 --> 00:35:45.880
Today I also prepared a bag of flour

00:35:46.960 --> 00:35:47.840
flour.

00:35:48.320 --> 00:35:49.440
Let's compare it.

00:35:49.480 --> 00:35:51.480
Who would like to have a try?

00:35:51.480 --> 00:35:51.960
Me.

00:35:52.720 --> 00:35:54.120
It's you. Come on.

00:35:54.440 --> 00:35:56.700
Let's use the beauty honey powder first.

00:36:08.960 --> 00:36:09.800
Look.

00:36:09.800 --> 00:36:11.880
We actually bought a box of flour

00:36:11.880 --> 00:36:13.320
to buy a box of flour.

00:36:13.640 --> 00:36:15.080
The quality and effect

00:36:15.440 --> 00:36:18.280
I can't believe it's in the cosmetics that ladies must buy.

00:36:18.280 --> 00:36:20.210
among the cosmetics of all ladies.

00:36:21.600 --> 00:36:23.760
Just because it's called Qiaojia,

00:36:23.880 --> 00:36:25.740
Will it become a beauty if I buy it?

00:36:27.080 --> 00:36:28.720
Girls, promise me

00:36:29.040 --> 00:36:31.440
Throw it away now

00:36:31.760 --> 00:36:33.320
That's right.

00:36:33.720 --> 00:36:34.650
Thank you, miss.

00:36:35.720 --> 00:36:36.600
Next,

00:36:36.640 --> 00:36:40.080
I'm going to introduce the fifth place on the red list.

00:36:40.480 --> 00:36:42.210
Rouge, Eighth Sister's Rouge.

00:36:43.560 --> 00:36:44.880
Where's Eighth Sister's lipstick?

00:36:44.880 --> 00:36:46.640
is Master Wang from the east of the city.

00:36:46.640 --> 00:36:48.160
for his beloved wife.

00:36:48.160 --> 00:36:50.160
for her beloved wife.

00:36:50.440 --> 00:36:52.120
The bee wax made by Master Wang

00:36:52.120 --> 00:36:53.720
It's a good product

00:36:53.960 --> 00:36:56.760
that all women and children know.

00:36:57.440 --> 00:36:58.920
Wang's bee wax is the base.

00:36:58.920 --> 00:37:01.960
and the rose that represents love

00:37:02.160 --> 00:37:05.040
which represents love.

00:37:05.440 --> 00:37:06.800
Let's smell it again.

00:37:06.800 --> 00:37:07.960
It's really nice

00:37:08.920 --> 00:37:09.840
Smell it

00:37:15.320 --> 00:37:16.080
Smells good

00:37:18.840 --> 00:37:21.480
Very fragrant

00:37:22.320 --> 00:37:23.250
Master Wang said

00:37:23.360 --> 00:37:24.440
lipstick is valuable.

00:37:24.440 --> 00:37:25.500
Love is priceless.

00:37:25.520 --> 00:37:26.780
With a big sale of love,

00:37:26.800 --> 00:37:28.960
From today onwards, we'll purchase Bayi's lipstick.

00:37:28.960 --> 00:37:29.760
Can you get

00:37:30.360 --> 00:37:31.480
20% off.

00:37:37.960 --> 00:37:40.120
About the blind date tomorrow,

00:37:40.440 --> 00:37:42.120
I won't...

00:37:44.560 --> 00:37:46.040
tomorrow.

00:37:56.040 --> 00:37:57.760
He won't.

00:38:03.320 --> 00:38:03.920
Lord Xu.

00:38:04.080 --> 00:38:05.680
Hurry up! Hurry up! Hurry up!

00:38:10.520 --> 00:38:12.040
Beauty, save the hero.

00:38:17.600 --> 00:38:19.360
They look great together.

00:38:21.160 --> 00:38:22.440
Ladies,

00:38:23.000 --> 00:38:26.200
I haven't announced the first place on the blacklist yet.

00:38:26.360 --> 00:38:27.120
Come back.

00:38:29.320 --> 00:38:31.280
Now I'm going to announce

00:38:31.520 --> 00:38:33.120
No.1 on the blacklist.

00:38:33.520 --> 00:38:34.800
Beauty meteorite.

00:38:36.480 --> 00:38:38.000
You must have heard of it.

00:38:38.360 --> 00:38:40.440
This foundation is amazing.

00:38:40.560 --> 00:38:43.480
It's the top beauty makeup artist in Chang'an.

00:38:43.560 --> 00:38:44.920
the most famous

00:38:44.920 --> 00:38:47.280
of heroes.

00:38:47.800 --> 00:38:48.640
Surprised?

00:38:48.960 --> 00:38:51.640
It's the last cosmetics I should buy.

00:38:51.640 --> 00:38:53.080
Why not?

00:38:54.080 --> 00:38:55.960
Thank you for your help.

00:38:58.440 --> 00:39:00.120
It's nothing.

00:39:01.000 --> 00:39:02.000
I can finally repay

00:39:02.000 --> 00:39:03.760
for saving my life that day.

00:39:04.160 --> 00:39:05.720
Where are you going?

00:39:06.800 --> 00:39:08.600
I plan to go back to my residence.

00:39:09.160 --> 00:39:10.160
I heard that

00:39:10.160 --> 00:39:12.220
a woman has found out your residence.

00:39:12.880 --> 00:39:15.320
It's not safe for you to go back now.

00:39:15.640 --> 00:39:16.960
If I go back now,

00:39:16.960 --> 00:39:18.440
if those girls come after me,

00:39:18.440 --> 00:39:20.280
it would be inappropriate.

00:39:20.960 --> 00:39:23.690
Why don't you go back to the mansion with me first?

00:39:23.960 --> 00:39:24.800
No.

00:39:25.800 --> 00:39:27.360
I'd better go back to my place.

00:39:27.360 --> 00:39:28.120
Without me,

00:39:28.440 --> 00:39:29.800
who knows

00:39:29.800 --> 00:39:31.440
will do.

00:39:31.840 --> 00:39:33.640
She's trying to trap me to death.

00:39:34.360 --> 00:39:35.360
I know the whole city

00:39:35.360 --> 00:39:36.960
is not your own will.

00:39:37.600 --> 00:39:39.080
Of course not.

00:39:39.960 --> 00:39:41.120
Who would have thought

00:39:41.120 --> 00:39:42.960
I'm so popular among women.

00:39:44.360 --> 00:39:45.290
Unfortunately,

00:39:45.360 --> 00:39:46.760
I can't find a good match.

00:39:47.600 --> 00:39:49.120
You're quite handsome.

00:39:49.560 --> 00:39:51.960
It's not strange that others admire you.

00:39:52.520 --> 00:39:54.120
But you need to remember

00:39:54.360 --> 00:39:56.560
Deok-biao is the perfect match for you.

00:40:02.600 --> 00:40:03.120
Sir.

00:40:04.880 --> 00:40:07.800
It doesn't matter if you don't answer Deok-biao directly.

00:40:07.800 --> 00:40:10.660
Deok-biao will wait for the moment you fall in love.

00:40:26.520 --> 00:40:27.040
Tell me.

00:40:27.960 --> 00:40:28.960
Who is it this time?

00:40:28.960 --> 00:40:30.360
The five daughters of Lord Liu of the Ministry of Revenue

00:40:30.360 --> 00:40:32.490
returned all the good-looking goods.

00:40:34.960 --> 00:40:36.020
How many are these?

00:40:36.600 --> 00:40:37.520
Two hours ago.

00:40:38.160 --> 00:40:39.960
After Hua Xiaochi's promotion,

00:40:40.520 --> 00:40:41.360
there will be

00:40:42.960 --> 00:40:44.520
139 refunds.

00:40:45.920 --> 00:40:48.380
Mr. Wu from Ministry of Rites sent a message.

00:40:48.960 --> 00:40:50.520
We need you to get ready

00:40:50.840 --> 00:40:53.640
and give the ladies and daughters an explanation.

00:40:58.440 --> 00:40:59.080
Jin'er!

00:41:00.040 --> 00:41:01.240
[Jin'er!] [Jin'er!]

00:41:05.040 --> 00:41:05.960
Now,

00:41:06.600 --> 00:41:08.880
we can only confront that witch.

00:41:09.560 --> 00:41:12.220
and make her admit that she's talking nonsense.

00:41:14.560 --> 00:41:15.960
It's not all nonsense.

00:41:16.920 --> 00:41:17.850
What do you mean?

00:41:19.840 --> 00:41:22.760
Although the meteorite is light and obedient,

00:41:23.120 --> 00:41:25.120
but it does have a great side effect.

00:41:25.560 --> 00:41:26.640
Before the production,

00:41:26.640 --> 00:41:28.440
before the production.

00:41:28.600 --> 00:41:31.460
Although he controlled the dosage and proportion,

00:41:31.640 --> 00:41:32.640
but long-term use

00:41:33.440 --> 00:41:34.970
is not good for your health.

00:41:35.960 --> 00:41:37.440
I'm pouring the powder now.

00:41:37.440 --> 00:41:38.720
to improve it.

00:41:39.560 --> 00:41:40.620
But unexpectedly,

00:41:40.960 --> 00:41:42.560
the witch surnamed Hua

00:41:43.120 --> 00:41:44.280
by that witch Hua.

00:41:46.640 --> 00:41:48.100
Where are you going, baby?

00:41:51.400 --> 00:41:52.530
Remove your makeup.

00:42:04.560 --> 00:42:05.490
Change clothes.

00:42:06.360 --> 00:42:07.280
So luxurious

00:42:08.400 --> 00:42:09.520
glowing.

00:42:09.520 --> 00:42:10.800
Where are you going?

00:42:11.840 --> 00:42:12.770
Jin'er is right.

00:42:13.480 --> 00:42:15.080
I want to meet her myself.

00:42:15.720 --> 00:42:17.160
That witch surnamed Hua.

00:42:17.800 --> 00:42:19.860
Let's take a look at its composition.

00:42:20.560 --> 00:42:21.600
It's lead.

00:42:21.920 --> 00:42:23.840
The lead is poisonous.

00:42:24.440 --> 00:42:25.400
After a long time,

00:42:25.400 --> 00:42:27.840
it will directly reflect on our skin.

00:42:27.960 --> 00:42:29.000
Too much lead.

00:42:29.040 --> 00:42:31.360
The skin is dark at the beginning.

00:42:31.560 --> 00:42:32.720
Too dry

00:42:32.840 --> 00:42:34.160
The skin is not balanced.

00:42:34.160 --> 00:42:37.160
If you use it every day it will directly affect your brain

00:42:37.160 --> 00:42:38.800
You'll get dementia.

00:42:39.280 --> 00:42:39.960
I hate it.

00:42:39.960 --> 00:42:40.880
Alzheimer's.

00:42:41.240 --> 00:42:42.360
What should I do?

00:42:42.440 --> 00:42:43.720
I used it before

00:42:44.960 --> 00:42:46.440
Excuse me

00:42:46.960 --> 00:42:47.520
Here.

00:42:49.080 --> 00:42:50.140
Young Master Ying.

00:42:50.280 --> 00:42:52.280
Young Master is so handsome.

00:43:08.120 --> 00:43:09.980
Young Master Ying is so handsome.

00:43:19.080 --> 00:43:19.960
Young Master.

00:43:20.480 --> 00:43:21.800
Long time no see.

00:43:21.920 --> 00:43:22.920
I know

00:43:23.440 --> 00:43:24.560
what you just said.

00:43:26.800 --> 00:43:28.000
He heard everything.

00:43:28.080 --> 00:43:30.960
Sir, don't blame me for being blunt.

00:43:32.520 --> 00:43:34.400
It's true that meteorite is harmful to your body.

00:43:34.400 --> 00:43:36.920
But how many times do you have in your life?

00:43:37.560 --> 00:43:40.080
Why don't you bloom in your best years?

00:43:40.440 --> 00:43:41.280
Time is short

00:43:42.080 --> 00:43:43.320
and have fun in time.

00:43:44.160 --> 00:43:47.160
There are many ways to entertain in time.

00:43:47.440 --> 00:43:49.880
You don't have to use poison.

00:43:51.800 --> 00:43:54.560
I've studied beauty makeup for more than ten years.

00:43:54.560 --> 00:43:56.440
I don't know how

00:43:56.760 --> 00:43:58.160
to make your face

00:43:58.760 --> 00:44:00.320
and not harm your health.

00:44:00.920 --> 00:44:03.920
I'll show you

00:44:05.280 --> 00:44:06.120
That's great.

00:44:07.920 --> 00:44:08.440
Come on.

00:44:08.800 --> 00:44:10.730
That's what I've been waiting for.

00:44:12.160 --> 00:44:14.360
I can fight you now.

00:44:14.720 --> 00:44:16.440
and see if there are

00:44:16.560 --> 00:44:18.640
in ordinary cosmetics.

00:44:19.520 --> 00:44:21.980
I wonder if you dare to accept the challenge.

00:44:22.280 --> 00:44:24.440
After all, you are the best in Chang'an.

00:44:24.440 --> 00:44:26.920
What should we do if we lose?

00:44:28.080 --> 00:44:28.440
Yes.

00:44:28.560 --> 00:44:30.640
Young Master Ying, don't be afraid to compete with her.

00:44:30.640 --> 00:44:31.970
Yes. Compared with her.

00:44:32.440 --> 00:44:34.760
Don't be afraid.

00:44:34.760 --> 00:44:36.440
Which side are you on?

00:44:39.040 --> 00:44:39.880
Now?

00:44:40.440 --> 00:44:42.700
Otherwise, why didn't I close the stall?

00:44:43.520 --> 00:44:45.120
I was waiting for you.

00:44:48.400 --> 00:44:49.600
You set me up?

00:44:49.960 --> 00:44:52.040
How could you say that?

00:44:52.040 --> 00:44:53.800
I'm diligent.

00:44:53.920 --> 00:44:56.120
I want to play with you.

00:44:56.880 --> 00:44:58.960
What? You don't dare?

00:45:02.760 --> 00:45:04.760
Trust Young Master Ying. It's fine.

00:45:06.000 --> 00:45:06.840
Why not?

00:45:12.240 --> 00:45:13.880
I've been waiting for you to say that.

00:45:13.880 --> 00:45:15.610
I've already chosen the judge.

00:45:16.400 --> 00:45:19.130
Mr. Ba from Qingfeng Tea House across the street.

00:45:27.280 --> 00:45:27.960
Everyone.

00:45:28.120 --> 00:45:30.960
Who are these two masters from today's competition?

00:45:30.960 --> 00:45:31.440
One

00:45:31.440 --> 00:45:34.120
is Miss Hua whom we know very well.

00:45:34.280 --> 00:45:37.160
And the other is the hero, Young Master Ying.

00:45:37.400 --> 00:45:39.160
The best makeup artist in Chang'an.

00:45:39.160 --> 00:45:41.240
It's bestowed by the royal family.

00:45:41.320 --> 00:45:42.760
[by the royal family.]

00:45:46.120 --> 00:45:47.520
Your future husband

00:45:47.880 --> 00:45:49.480
He's powerful and powerful.

00:45:50.000 --> 00:45:51.440
and has a great backing.

00:45:51.600 --> 00:45:54.120
During the years Young Master Ying managed the beauty business,

00:45:54.120 --> 00:45:56.880
through the trade between Chang'an and foreign countries.

00:45:56.880 --> 00:45:59.120
There are less than 10,000 taels of silver

00:45:59.120 --> 00:46:00.320
every year

00:46:00.880 --> 00:46:02.840
there will be thousands of taels

00:46:08.720 --> 00:46:11.000
This man asked for it from outside.

00:46:11.040 --> 00:46:14.640
You've shown your deepest potential in destiny.

00:46:17.840 --> 00:46:19.280
Lofty and powerful.

00:46:19.600 --> 00:46:20.930
Be upright. Be upright.

00:46:21.040 --> 00:46:22.400
He is upright.

00:46:22.840 --> 00:46:23.920
and handsome.

00:46:28.360 --> 00:46:29.840
Oh, my God. You're so handsome.

00:46:29.840 --> 00:46:31.480
What are you doing? What are you doing?
