Firecrackers!

00:08:25.240 --> 00:08:26.360
- Great!
- Great!

00:08:49.784 --> 00:08:51.224
(With the sound of firecrackers,)

00:08:51.759 --> 00:08:55.960
(the opening of Yuehai
ended in chaos and joy.)

00:08:57.360 --> 00:08:59.440
(Looking at all the smiling faces,)

00:08:59.919 --> 00:09:01.200
(I felt a little dazed.)

00:09:02.519 --> 00:09:04.840
(As if I wasn't in a ceremony,)

00:09:05.759 --> 00:09:08.440
(but pulled into a boiling life.)

00:09:10.879 --> 00:09:12.440
(I feel lucky)

00:09:13.080 --> 00:09:15.240
(to have met a group
of people like Zheng Decheng,)

00:09:15.600 --> 00:09:18.159
(who think outside the box
and dare to be pioneers.)

00:09:20.080 --> 00:09:21.480
(Fighting alongside them)

00:09:21.759 --> 00:09:23.720
(fills me with confidence
for the future.)

00:09:26.360 --> 00:09:27.120
(But)

00:09:27.840 --> 00:09:30.759
(Zheng Decheng still is a little man.)

00:09:32.399 --> 00:09:33.399
(The next day,)

00:09:34.519 --> 00:09:36.039
(he made trouble again.)

00:09:48.360 --> 00:09:48.860
Who?

00:09:49.919 --> 00:09:50.559
Who is it?

00:09:57.559 --> 00:09:58.679
Good morning, Ms. Li.

00:09:59.120 --> 00:09:59.759
Meng?

00:10:00.919 --> 00:10:02.120
Up so early?

00:10:02.399 --> 00:10:03.279
What's up?

00:10:03.519 --> 00:10:04.200
It's not early.

00:10:04.559 --> 00:10:06.559
It's already past 4 AM.

00:10:07.519 --> 00:10:08.639
We'll go watch the sunrise.

00:10:08.759 --> 00:10:09.559
Have to go now.

00:10:09.840 --> 00:10:10.679
Or we'll be late.

00:10:11.360 --> 00:10:12.279
4 AM?

00:10:13.480 --> 00:10:14.399
Watch the sunrise?

00:10:15.200 --> 00:10:15.700
Right.

00:10:16.279 --> 00:10:16.960
Mr. Zheng said

00:10:17.519 --> 00:10:19.000
that I'm responsible for you now.

00:10:19.190 --> 00:10:19.690
Look.

00:10:20.279 --> 00:10:22.360
This is the itinerary
he carefully arranged for you.

00:10:22.960 --> 00:10:23.799
(Ms. Li's Itinerary)
The first item,

00:10:23.919 --> 00:10:24.639
watch the sunrise.

00:10:26.968 --> 00:10:28.952
(Ms. Li's Itinerary, Repeats Next Week)

00:10:30.559 --> 00:10:31.639
Watch the sunrise?

00:10:40.600 --> 00:10:42.240
Good morning!

00:10:47.320 --> 00:10:48.320
Yuehai!

00:10:49.919 --> 00:10:51.440
I'm here!

00:10:53.600 --> 00:10:56.399
Good morning, Yuehai!

00:11:10.159 --> 00:11:11.200
- So beautiful.
- Right?

00:11:11.799 --> 00:11:12.399
I told you.

00:11:12.639 --> 00:11:14.720
Yuehai has the most beautiful sunrise.

00:11:30.879 --> 00:11:31.440
Look.

00:11:31.879 --> 00:11:32.759
There are words here.

00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:41.840
When you feel sad, watch the sunrise.

00:11:42.519 --> 00:11:44.360
It will warm your heart.

00:11:45.039 --> 00:11:46.200
Do you know who wrote this?

00:11:47.032 --> 00:11:47.960
Mr. Zheng wrote it.

00:11:49.799 --> 00:11:51.080
Mr. Zheng?

00:11:51.360 --> 00:11:51.879
Yes.

00:11:59.080 --> 00:12:02.240
When you feel sad, watch the sunrise.

00:12:08.799 --> 00:12:09.399
Meng.

00:12:10.039 --> 00:12:11.279
Why are there sheep here?

00:12:11.600 --> 00:12:12.799
Must be from Ping'an Road.

00:12:13.759 --> 00:12:14.960
They don't need herding.

00:12:15.120 --> 00:12:15.879
They know the way.

00:12:16.399 --> 00:12:17.360
Amazing.

00:12:18.039 --> 00:12:19.080
Ping'an Road.

00:12:20.759 --> 00:12:22.639
Ms. Li, would you like to go?

00:12:23.059 --> 00:12:23.559
Sure.

00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:25.200
Come on. Follow the sheep.

00:12:25.440 --> 00:12:26.000
It's not far.

00:12:52.600 --> 00:12:54.279
Go! Back!

00:13:03.559 --> 00:13:05.279
Hey! You splashed me!

00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:07.039
Alright, you go.

00:13:07.519 --> 00:13:08.320
Go.

00:13:12.519 --> 00:13:13.279
What's up, Ms. Li?

00:13:14.360 --> 00:13:14.960
Are you okay?

00:13:15.960 --> 00:13:16.279
Go!

00:13:18.320 --> 00:13:19.320
Sorry!

00:13:19.759 --> 00:13:20.559
Come here.

00:13:20.720 --> 00:13:21.559
Go! Move aside!

00:13:21.679 --> 00:13:22.279
Go! Go!

00:13:22.279 --> 00:13:22.480
Go!

00:13:22.559 --> 00:13:24.320
Move!

00:13:24.440 --> 00:13:25.240
Go!

00:13:25.799 --> 00:13:26.679
Go! This way!

00:13:26.759 --> 00:13:27.519
Go!

00:13:28.159 --> 00:13:29.559
Hurry!

00:13:29.720 --> 00:13:31.440
- My pig!
- Your pig ran away!

00:13:31.559 --> 00:13:32.720
My pig!

00:13:36.080 --> 00:13:36.919
Be careful!

00:13:40.120 --> 00:13:40.840
Mr. Guan, morning!

00:13:41.159 --> 00:13:41.879
Morning.

00:13:48.440 --> 00:13:49.000
Hello.

00:13:49.360 --> 00:13:50.519
Don't dump garbage here.

00:13:51.120 --> 00:13:52.120
It's piled up so high.

00:13:52.399 --> 00:13:53.120
Who are you?

00:13:53.279 --> 00:13:54.120
Mind your business.

00:13:54.360 --> 00:13:55.240
Lunatic.

00:13:55.960 --> 00:13:57.000
Watch your mouth!

00:13:58.600 --> 00:13:59.399
I'm talking to you!

00:13:59.399 --> 00:14:00.159
Can't you hear me?

00:14:00.960 --> 00:14:01.559
Watch out!

00:14:04.039 --> 00:14:04.639
Are you okay?

00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:07.500
Let's go.

00:14:13.720 --> 00:14:14.220
Meng.

00:14:14.360 --> 00:14:15.559
Has it always been like this?

00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:16.919
No one manages it?

00:14:18.759 --> 00:14:19.720
No one.

00:14:24.840 --> 00:14:25.360
Who did that?

00:14:25.679 --> 00:14:26.919
Who dumps garbage?

00:14:28.399 --> 00:14:29.279
Are you okay, Ms. Li?

00:14:29.799 --> 00:14:30.879
Well done!

00:14:38.960 --> 00:14:40.120
Isn't this exaggerated?

00:14:40.639 --> 00:14:41.879
Not at all. Looks good.

00:14:44.399 --> 00:14:45.759
Looks better plain.

00:14:50.159 --> 00:14:50.840
Ms. Li.

00:14:51.360 --> 00:14:53.240
Do you feel uncomfortable?

00:14:53.679 --> 00:14:55.000
Any dizziness or nausea?

00:14:55.360 --> 00:14:55.879
No.

00:14:56.799 --> 00:14:57.320
That's good.

00:14:57.759 --> 00:14:59.039
Then no concussion.

00:14:59.440 --> 00:15:01.720
But you still need to rest today.

00:15:01.720 --> 00:15:02.720
- About the rest...
- Meng.

00:15:03.120 --> 00:15:04.320
The streets are so dirty.

00:15:04.399 --> 00:15:05.840
Didn't Mr. Zheng deal with this?

00:15:06.919 --> 00:15:07.879
He is too busy.

00:15:08.399 --> 00:15:09.360
Can't cover everything.

00:15:10.000 --> 00:15:11.320
Maybe he didn't even notice.

00:15:11.840 --> 00:15:12.919
If you hadn't said it,

00:15:13.039 --> 00:15:13.799
I wouldn't have.

00:15:15.120 --> 00:15:16.480
Missed such an obvious problem?

00:15:16.759 --> 00:15:17.840
That busy?

00:15:18.159 --> 00:15:19.240
You'll get used to it soon.

00:15:19.799 --> 00:15:20.320
Too tight?

00:15:29.759 --> 00:15:31.240
Prosperity pigeon paired with wine.

00:15:32.120 --> 00:15:33.720
Prosperity will last forever.

00:15:33.879 --> 00:15:34.519
Exactly.

00:15:34.519 --> 00:15:35.679
Serving the dishes yourself?

00:15:35.799 --> 00:15:36.360
Let me do it.

00:15:40.039 --> 00:15:40.600
- Ms. Li.
- Ms. Li.

00:15:40.799 --> 00:15:41.759
What happened?

00:15:41.840 --> 00:15:42.679
Is your head okay?

00:15:44.240 --> 00:15:44.799
It's fine.

00:15:45.639 --> 00:15:46.480
Just got hit.

00:15:46.679 --> 00:15:47.759
I'm fine.

00:15:48.200 --> 00:15:49.080
Got hit? Who did that?

00:15:49.440 --> 00:15:50.159
Trash fell on me.

00:15:50.399 --> 00:15:51.320
No idea who did it.

00:15:51.399 --> 00:15:52.039
We were walking,

00:15:52.080 --> 00:15:53.679
and suddenly it came flying down.

00:15:53.840 --> 00:15:54.360
Not serious?

00:15:54.559 --> 00:15:55.480
That's unlucky.

00:15:55.679 --> 00:15:57.080
Be careful. You just took office.

00:15:57.080 --> 00:15:57.799
Where's Mr. Zheng?

00:15:58.039 --> 00:16:01.159
He went drinking in the next village.

00:16:01.320 --> 00:16:02.440
Tossing things around again.

00:16:03.440 --> 00:16:05.080
You should go to the county clinic.

00:16:05.799 --> 00:16:06.919
- Go to...
- No. I've checked it.

00:16:09.519 --> 00:16:10.200
Wait for him.

00:16:12.279 --> 00:16:13.120
Alright.

00:16:14.000 --> 00:16:14.600
I'll take this.

00:16:14.600 --> 00:16:15.100
Sit.

00:16:15.919 --> 00:16:17.759
Stop littering.

00:16:18.100 --> 00:16:18.600
It's fine.

00:16:19.080 --> 00:16:20.536
For Mr. Zheng,

00:16:20.536 --> 00:16:22.320
he can drink boldly but not much.

00:16:23.440 --> 00:16:24.759
Must be drunk when he's back.

00:16:25.120 --> 00:16:26.360
Who says I'm drunk?

00:16:27.759 --> 00:16:28.519
You're back.

00:16:29.039 --> 00:16:30.519
I can walk straight.

00:16:31.399 --> 00:16:32.639
I'll show you.

00:16:32.639 --> 00:16:33.399
Right.

00:16:33.399 --> 00:16:33.899
Over here.

00:16:34.168 --> 00:16:34.708
Here.

00:16:35.039 --> 00:16:35.759
Follow my voice!

00:16:36.919 --> 00:16:37.399
Mr. Zheng.

00:16:37.480 --> 00:16:38.240
Who said I'm drunk?

00:16:38.240 --> 00:16:39.080
Take a seat.

00:16:39.399 --> 00:16:40.399
Look at that rosy face.

00:16:41.360 --> 00:16:41.760
Okay.

00:16:41.799 --> 00:16:42.759
You haven't started?

00:16:42.879 --> 00:16:43.960
Let's have a toast first!

00:16:44.120 --> 00:16:44.620
Alright.

00:16:44.620 --> 00:16:45.120
You...

00:16:45.279 --> 00:16:46.279
No rush.

00:16:46.279 --> 00:16:46.679
No rush.

00:16:46.919 --> 00:16:47.559
Pour the wine.

00:16:47.639 --> 00:16:48.840
Come on.

00:16:49.360 --> 00:16:50.519
Fill them up.

00:16:50.559 --> 00:16:51.360
- Top me up.
- Ms. Li.

00:16:51.360 --> 00:16:51.879
Ms. Li.

00:16:53.080 --> 00:16:53.679
Thank you.

00:16:53.879 --> 00:16:55.639
Why is there full...

00:16:56.159 --> 00:16:56.840
Is this chicken

00:16:56.840 --> 00:16:57.919
or pigeon?

00:16:58.080 --> 00:16:59.320
It's our prosperity pigeon.

00:16:59.320 --> 00:17:00.120
Prosperity pigeon.

00:17:00.120 --> 00:17:00.559
Here.

00:17:01.080 --> 00:17:01.600
Cheers.

00:17:01.784 --> 00:17:02.240
Come on!

00:17:02.240 --> 00:17:03.080
Down it!

00:17:03.360 --> 00:17:04.759
Welcome back!

00:17:08.440 --> 00:17:09.079
Just take a sip.

00:17:10.720 --> 00:17:11.559
Sit.

00:17:13.559 --> 00:17:14.079
Be careful.

00:17:14.440 --> 00:17:15.279
I'm holding him.

00:17:15.599 --> 00:17:15.999
See?

00:17:16.319 --> 00:17:17.240
No worries.

Mr. Zheng.

00:17:40.079 --> 00:17:41.000
Sobered up?

00:17:41.839 --> 00:17:44.279
There's something I need to report.

00:17:45.319 --> 00:17:46.640
I'm not drunk. Go ahead.

00:17:47.759 --> 00:17:50.000
I went to see the sunrise
with Meng today.

00:18:17.000 --> 00:18:18.039
Why am I sleeping here?

00:18:19.119 --> 00:18:20.240
Where's the others?

00:18:20.240 --> 00:18:22.000
Why didn't they send me back?

00:18:22.359 --> 00:18:23.839
Mr. Zheng, you're awake.

00:18:25.880 --> 00:18:27.240
The others were all drunk.

00:18:27.519 --> 00:18:29.560
I was sober, but I couldn't move you.

00:18:29.560 --> 00:18:30.872
Just covered you with a quilt.

00:18:32.400 --> 00:18:33.599
Is this quilt yours?

00:18:33.680 --> 00:18:34.180
Yes.

00:18:35.000 --> 00:18:36.359
I-I got it dirty.

00:18:36.359 --> 00:18:37.240
I'm sorry.

00:18:37.519 --> 00:18:38.279
Thank you so much.

00:18:38.720 --> 00:18:39.240
It's fine.

00:18:39.400 --> 00:18:40.680
Just wash it and return it.

00:18:42.319 --> 00:18:43.240
Me? Wash it?

00:18:45.400 --> 00:18:46.359
Alright then.

00:18:49.368 --> 00:18:49.880
What?

00:18:49.880 --> 00:18:51.039
Ms. Li, anything to say?

00:18:51.759 --> 00:18:52.359
Mr. Zheng.

00:18:52.359 --> 00:18:53.839
Meng took me to see the sunrise.

00:18:54.400 --> 00:18:56.599
On the way back,
I noticed some problems.

00:18:56.960 --> 00:18:57.599
What problems?

00:18:58.480 --> 00:19:02.119
Yuehai's sanitation can be described
as dirty, disorderly, and substandard.

00:19:02.559 --> 00:19:03.799
Garbage is everywhere.

00:19:04.160 --> 00:19:06.640
Is there no unified management
of household livestock

00:19:06.720 --> 00:19:08.039
and poultry in Yuehai?

00:19:08.640 --> 00:19:09.752
They run around,

00:19:09.912 --> 00:19:11.279
leaving droppings everywhere.

00:19:13.480 --> 00:19:14.759
What you're saying

00:19:14.920 --> 00:19:15.960
is indeed a problem.

00:19:15.960 --> 00:19:16.680
I know it.

00:19:17.039 --> 00:19:17.920
But you see,

00:19:18.079 --> 00:19:19.759
Yuehai has a special situation.

00:19:20.640 --> 00:19:22.759
Documents require residents

00:19:23.160 --> 00:19:25.279
to bring their own food.

00:19:25.519 --> 00:19:28.279
They have to feed themselves.

00:19:28.799 --> 00:19:30.640
So raising chickens, ducks, pigs,

00:19:30.720 --> 00:19:32.160
is perfectly normal, right?

00:19:32.599 --> 00:19:34.039
We can't control it.

00:19:34.599 --> 00:19:35.920
But you're also right.

00:19:36.000 --> 00:19:37.480
The animals should be fenced in.

00:19:37.759 --> 00:19:39.440
They can't just run loose everywhere.

00:19:39.480 --> 00:19:40.480
That's unacceptable.

00:19:41.119 --> 00:19:42.720
So, I'll solve this.

00:19:43.039 --> 00:19:43.759
Anything else?

00:19:44.200 --> 00:19:44.720
Mr. Zheng.

00:19:44.799 --> 00:19:46.480
I think fencing alone isn't enough.

00:19:47.000 --> 00:19:48.279
If we're building a city,

00:19:48.559 --> 00:19:51.319
we should build to city standards.

00:19:52.400 --> 00:19:53.920
To cultivate the character of it.

00:19:54.200 --> 00:19:54.700
Right.

00:19:54.880 --> 00:19:56.079
But... Don't worry.

00:19:56.240 --> 00:19:57.559
I already have a solution.

00:19:57.799 --> 00:19:58.400
Take a look.

00:20:00.119 --> 00:20:01.079
Li, you've worked hard.

00:20:01.079 --> 00:20:01.680
If possible,

00:20:01.680 --> 00:20:02.400
let's execute it.

00:20:02.400 --> 00:20:02.880
Okay.

00:20:02.880 --> 00:20:03.920
Well, let me take a look.

00:20:04.079 --> 00:20:05.400
Then, I'll share it with Xie

00:20:05.720 --> 00:20:08.200
and call everyone
for a meeting to discuss.

00:20:09.119 --> 00:20:10.119
That'll take time...

00:20:10.200 --> 00:20:11.480
Work hard!

00:20:11.519 --> 00:20:12.640
Yes!

00:20:12.960 --> 00:20:14.400
Sweat it out!

00:20:14.400 --> 00:20:15.519
Yes!

00:20:15.799 --> 00:20:17.160
Work hard!

00:20:17.200 --> 00:20:18.160
Yes!

00:20:18.279 --> 00:20:20.440
One, two! Yes!

00:20:20.680 --> 00:20:23.224

00:20:42.240 --> 00:20:42.920
Mr. Zheng.

00:20:43.200 --> 00:20:44.240
I know you're tired.

00:20:44.480 --> 00:20:45.759
Have you read the plan?

00:20:45.759 --> 00:20:46.319
Any thoughts?

00:20:46.599 --> 00:20:47.359
I've read it,

00:20:47.880 --> 00:20:49.480
but I'm exhausted today.

00:20:49.839 --> 00:20:51.160
Can we talk tomorrow?

00:20:52.559 --> 00:20:53.319
Just ten minutes.

00:20:53.400 --> 00:20:53.920
Well.

00:20:53.920 --> 00:20:55.599
Smell me. I'm covered in stinky sweat.

00:20:55.599 --> 00:20:57.079
I need to clean myself first.

00:20:57.279 --> 00:20:58.480
Hot water will run out soon.

00:21:07.799 --> 00:21:09.480
Can you believe it?

00:21:10.279 --> 00:21:12.279
I'm chased around by a woman.

00:21:12.680 --> 00:21:13.759
So embarrassing.

00:21:20.440 --> 00:21:21.200
All bathing here?

00:21:25.079 --> 00:21:25.599
Nice.

00:21:26.119 --> 00:21:26.559
Nice.

00:21:27.480 --> 00:21:28.640
I had a feeling.

00:21:29.400 --> 00:21:30.519
You would be coming too.

00:21:31.799 --> 00:21:32.440
Everyone's here.

00:21:35.720 --> 00:21:36.319
Feel good.

00:21:36.759 --> 00:21:39.039
Ms. Li was also acting strange today.

00:21:39.440 --> 00:21:40.160
Kept chasing me

00:21:40.599 --> 00:21:42.599
about that proposal over and over.

00:21:42.759 --> 00:21:43.680
More nagging than us.

00:21:44.559 --> 00:21:45.440
"Read it yet?"

00:21:45.599 --> 00:21:46.880
So what if I did?

00:21:46.920 --> 00:21:47.960
I can't make the decision.

00:21:49.039 --> 00:21:52.359
I've never taken
this many showers in my life.

00:21:55.119 --> 00:21:56.599
Can we go?

00:21:56.720 --> 00:21:57.960
I'll peel if I keep soaking.

00:22:00.359 --> 00:22:01.319
She's still outside.

00:22:02.079 --> 00:22:03.000
Keep bathing.

00:22:04.319 --> 00:22:05.799
We have poor hygiene?

00:22:06.799 --> 00:22:08.589
We take a bath every two weeks!

00:22:08.589 --> 00:22:09.720
We have poor hygiene?

00:22:09.720 --> 00:22:11.896
(Bathhouse)

00:22:18.168 --> 00:22:18.720
(Bathhouse)
Not here.

00:22:19.240 --> 00:22:20.119
Hurry!

00:22:21.160 --> 00:22:22.319
We're acting like thieves.

00:22:22.319 --> 00:22:22.799
Hurry up.

00:22:22.960 --> 00:22:23.640
Mr. Zheng!

00:22:24.039 --> 00:22:24.400
You...

00:22:24.680 --> 00:22:26.160
You are creepy, Ms. Li.

00:22:26.720 --> 00:22:27.279
Ms. Li.

00:22:27.559 --> 00:22:28.480
Y-You scared me.

00:22:28.480 --> 00:22:30.039
Still not resting this late?

00:22:30.160 --> 00:22:31.839
Your bath took quite a while.

00:22:32.519 --> 00:22:33.200
Mr. Zheng.

00:22:33.799 --> 00:22:35.640
Your personal hygiene is solved.

00:22:35.960 --> 00:22:37.359
Can we talk about Yuehai's

00:22:37.799 --> 00:22:38.680
sanitation now?

00:22:57.160 --> 00:22:57.960
Let me start.

00:22:58.799 --> 00:22:59.400
Ms. Li.

00:23:00.160 --> 00:23:01.480
We lack money for road repairs.

00:23:01.799 --> 00:23:03.200
Let alone toilets.

00:23:03.640 --> 00:23:04.160
I'm done.

00:23:04.440 --> 00:23:05.240
I'm dead tired.

00:23:05.279 --> 00:23:06.279
I'm going to bed.

00:23:25.240 --> 00:23:27.119
Frankly, I should...

00:23:29.400 --> 00:23:30.400
be heading back to sleep.

00:23:35.000 --> 00:23:36.000
Got things on my mind,

00:23:36.119 --> 00:23:37.720
I won't sleep anyway.

00:23:38.440 --> 00:23:41.880
Your plan is pretty brilliant.

00:23:42.599 --> 00:23:43.880
Currently, in Yuehai...

00:23:44.119 --> 00:23:44.960
Well, about the...

00:23:47.680 --> 00:23:52.720
Earlier inside,
we were thinking. You know?

00:23:52.880 --> 00:23:55.672
The main conflict we need to resolve

00:23:55.672 --> 00:23:57.592
is the early-stage development.

00:23:58.839 --> 00:23:59.960
About...

00:24:00.480 --> 00:24:01.200
Your...

00:24:01.359 --> 00:24:02.640
Your constructive,

00:24:02.720 --> 00:24:03.440
great idea...

00:24:03.480 --> 00:24:05.000
It is... Well...

00:24:09.880 --> 00:24:11.672
Right? You know.

00:24:11.672 --> 00:24:12.172
Right.

00:24:12.359 --> 00:24:14.960
First, we improve basic infrastructure.

00:24:15.119 --> 00:24:16.319
In the future. And then,

00:24:16.440 --> 00:24:19.960
add sanitation facilities
on every road, right?

00:24:20.500 --> 00:24:21.000
Right?

00:24:22.160 --> 00:24:22.680
Exactly.

00:24:22.920 --> 00:24:25.279
Money's an issue, right?

00:24:25.720 --> 00:24:26.359
Do we have it?

00:24:26.799 --> 00:24:27.279
Right.

00:24:28.279 --> 00:24:29.839
Ms. Li, I-I...

00:24:30.680 --> 00:24:32.160
Truly, we don't.

00:24:32.319 --> 00:24:34.279
I handle finances.

00:24:34.319 --> 00:24:35.400
We're stretched thin.

00:24:35.640 --> 00:24:37.240
I've budgeted down to the penny.

00:24:37.359 --> 00:24:37.839
Not enough.

00:24:38.680 --> 00:24:42.160
Also, about habits,
they are hard to change.

00:24:43.119 --> 00:24:44.000
Well, I think...

00:24:44.000 --> 00:24:45.480
I think Xie is correct.

00:24:45.599 --> 00:24:47.440
It all comes down to habit.

00:24:48.000 --> 00:24:48.839
Take me,

00:24:49.000 --> 00:24:49.720
everyone knows

00:24:49.920 --> 00:24:51.799
I'm hygienic and neat.

00:24:51.920 --> 00:24:53.440
So how did I pick up this good habit?

00:24:53.599 --> 00:24:55.720
Because my mom taught me that

00:24:55.799 --> 00:24:56.559
as I was a child.

00:24:56.824 --> 00:24:59.720
If I came home dirty from playing,

00:24:59.720 --> 00:25:00.920
my mom would say,

00:25:00.920 --> 00:25:02.359
"What will the neighbors think?"

00:25:02.759 --> 00:25:03.880
"It makes me look bad."

00:25:04.200 --> 00:25:05.119
Then I'd get spanked.

00:25:05.480 --> 00:25:07.880
But Yuehai's residents

00:25:08.039 --> 00:25:09.039
are all from rural areas.

00:25:09.079 --> 00:25:10.920
Habits aren't formed overnight.

00:25:11.400 --> 00:25:12.039
Mr. Tan.

00:25:12.279 --> 00:25:12.839
I know

00:25:13.000 --> 00:25:15.599
this habit is a tough one to crack.

00:25:15.920 --> 00:25:18.440
But we can't avoid it.

00:25:18.599 --> 00:25:18.960
Exactly.

00:25:19.000 --> 00:25:19.400
Of course.

00:25:19.440 --> 00:25:22.359
Now, we don't have big-city appeal

00:25:22.640 --> 00:25:25.400
or a modern environment.

00:25:26.119 --> 00:25:27.720
How do we attract investment?

00:25:28.079 --> 00:25:30.599
Why would businesses come to Yuehai?

00:25:31.799 --> 00:25:33.079
As for money,

00:25:33.599 --> 00:25:35.079
if adding facilities isn't realistic,

00:25:35.319 --> 00:25:39.599
can we plan ahead on roads

00:25:40.559 --> 00:25:41.799
not yet built?

00:25:42.200 --> 00:25:42.720
Plan.

00:25:44.079 --> 00:25:45.680
Yes! Plan!

00:25:46.160 --> 00:25:49.839
Ms. Li is absolutely right. Right?

00:25:50.319 --> 00:25:51.799
So it's not our fault.

00:25:52.119 --> 00:25:52.880
- Whose is it?
- Right?

00:25:53.319 --> 00:25:54.440
You said "plan",

00:25:54.799 --> 00:25:55.279
right?

00:25:55.960 --> 00:25:57.920
But I don't see many toilets

00:25:58.480 --> 00:25:59.799
on your planning map.

00:26:00.119 --> 00:26:02.119
Let alone sewage systems.

00:26:02.680 --> 00:26:05.359
So it isn't actually our responsibility.

00:26:05.759 --> 00:26:06.720
So do you want me

00:26:06.839 --> 00:26:10.319
to draw every latrine too?

00:26:10.440 --> 00:26:11.400
Right.

00:26:11.400 --> 00:26:11.640
Yes.

00:26:11.680 --> 00:26:12.200
Yes.

00:26:12.279 --> 00:26:13.240
No. That's not it.

00:26:14.119 --> 00:26:14.680
Well...

00:26:15.480 --> 00:26:17.720
We aren't college graduates.

00:26:17.880 --> 00:26:20.519
We are not so far-sighted like Ms. Li.

00:26:21.119 --> 00:26:21.599
But sure,

00:26:21.839 --> 00:26:23.079
what you mentioned,

00:26:23.240 --> 00:26:25.119
we could draw it.

00:26:26.240 --> 00:26:26.640
No.

00:26:27.480 --> 00:26:28.119
Plan it.

00:26:28.920 --> 00:26:29.920
- Right.
- Plan it.

00:26:30.000 --> 00:26:30.559
So Mr. Zheng,

00:26:30.559 --> 00:26:31.319
I'd like to ask.

00:26:31.400 --> 00:26:33.240
Who oversees sanitation here?

00:26:35.119 --> 00:26:38.160
Usually, the sanitation is...

00:26:38.240 --> 00:26:38.960
It's delegated.

00:26:39.119 --> 00:26:41.200
- Yes. It belongs to...
- The village level.

00:26:41.279 --> 00:26:42.160
To village cadres.

00:26:42.360 --> 00:26:43.736
Right. And...

00:26:43.736 --> 00:26:44.880
Neighborhood committee.

00:26:44.880 --> 00:26:46.200
The newly formed one.

00:26:46.759 --> 00:26:48.200
What about the town government?

00:26:48.600 --> 00:26:49.240
Who's in charge?

00:26:50.400 --> 00:26:50.920
Who?

00:26:53.119 --> 00:26:54.359
We each have our own workload.

00:26:54.400 --> 00:26:55.559
We're swamped already.

00:26:55.599 --> 00:26:56.160
Overloaded.

00:26:56.160 --> 00:26:56.759
I-I...

00:26:57.640 --> 00:26:58.920
I'm clearly not suitable.

00:26:59.279 --> 00:27:00.279
No one's assigned. Right?

00:27:00.880 --> 00:27:01.359
Okay.

00:27:03.079 --> 00:27:03.640
Fine then.

00:27:03.920 --> 00:27:06.799
I'll take charge of sanitation.

00:27:07.960 --> 00:27:08.880
That's wonderful.

00:27:08.960 --> 00:27:09.599
Great.

00:27:09.759 --> 00:27:12.880
Let's applaud Ms. Li
for taking responsibility.

00:27:13.160 --> 00:27:14.279
- Great!
- Great!

00:27:14.279 --> 00:27:14.680
Let's go.

00:27:14.880 --> 00:27:16.160
Ms. Li, good night.

00:27:16.359 --> 00:27:16.920
Mr. Zheng.

00:27:17.599 --> 00:27:18.640
I'm new here.

00:27:19.079 --> 00:27:20.839
People don't know me.

00:27:21.400 --> 00:27:23.440
I lack your stature, Mr. Zheng.

00:27:24.240 --> 00:27:26.759
It's hard to get work done.

00:27:27.519 --> 00:27:27.960
So...

00:27:29.480 --> 00:27:30.319
That's easy.

00:27:39.079 --> 00:27:42.359
Everyone. Attention.

00:27:43.279 --> 00:27:45.640
The lady sitting next to me

00:27:46.440 --> 00:27:51.960
is our newly appointed
Town Mayor, Li Qiuping.

00:27:52.559 --> 00:27:54.240
Dongjiang University graduate,

00:27:55.519 --> 00:27:56.599
bachelor's degree holder,

00:27:57.000 --> 00:27:57.559
unmarried.

00:27:58.119 --> 00:27:58.799
Mr. Zheng.

00:27:59.480 --> 00:28:01.016
You don't know my full situation.

00:28:01.016 --> 00:28:01.976
I'll introduce myself.

00:28:06.000 --> 00:28:06.759
Hello, everyone.

00:28:07.400 --> 00:28:09.960
I'm the new Town Mayor, Li Qiuping.

00:28:10.680 --> 00:28:12.279
I appreciate your support going forward.

00:28:12.472 --> 00:28:13.208
- Hello, Ms. Li!
- Hello, Ms. Li!

00:28:14.079 --> 00:28:15.400
You're so beautiful!

00:28:15.640 --> 00:28:17.200
Thank you. You're beautiful too.

00:28:17.200 --> 00:28:18.119
Thanks.

00:28:18.759 --> 00:28:19.519
Hello, everyone.

00:28:19.759 --> 00:28:23.960
I'm the new Town Mayor, Li Qiuping.

00:28:24.519 --> 00:28:27.440
I appreciate your support going forward.

00:28:27.799 --> 00:28:30.079
I'm the new Town Mayor, Li Qiuping.

00:28:30.440 --> 00:28:32.079
I appreciate your support going forward.

00:28:32.640 --> 00:28:34.319
I'm the new Town Mayor,

00:28:34.519 --> 00:28:35.440
Li Qiuping.

00:28:35.960 --> 00:28:37.079
I appreciate...

00:28:39.079 --> 00:28:39.519
Mr. Zheng.

00:28:39.880 --> 00:28:40.920
Mr. Xie is tired.

00:28:41.440 --> 00:28:42.296
Help him out.

00:28:42.296 --> 00:28:43.279
He's not tired.

00:28:43.279 --> 00:28:43.960
He's got energy.

00:28:45.759 --> 00:28:46.279
I'm fine.

00:28:46.759 --> 00:28:47.960
But I'll listen to Ms. Li.

00:28:50.319 --> 00:28:50.960
He's tired.

00:28:59.359 --> 00:29:00.960
Mr. Zheng, where are you heading?

00:29:01.279 --> 00:29:02.039
Why turn back?

00:29:02.400 --> 00:29:03.720
That's about enough.

00:29:03.920 --> 00:29:04.720
That won't do.

00:29:04.920 --> 00:29:07.200
How can we settle for "about enough"?

00:29:07.680 --> 00:29:09.039
There's a street left.

00:29:09.240 --> 00:29:10.279
Let's go there.

00:29:11.359 --> 00:29:12.599
Alright. Enough.

00:29:16.920 --> 00:29:18.000
Hurry up, Mr. Zheng.

00:29:18.440 --> 00:29:19.400
Let's go there.

00:29:19.759 --> 00:29:21.599
Many people there still don't know me.

00:29:24.359 --> 00:29:25.319
Fine. Okay.

00:29:30.039 --> 00:29:33.519
I'm the new Town Mayor, Li Qiuping.

00:29:33.839 --> 00:29:35.799
I appreciate your support going forward.

00:29:37.599 --> 00:29:38.240
Mr. Xie.

00:29:38.799 --> 00:29:39.839
I've been shouting long.

00:29:40.440 --> 00:29:41.640
Could you help me?

00:29:42.519 --> 00:29:43.759
Help me introduce myself.

00:29:47.519 --> 00:29:48.359
She's tired.

00:29:49.400 --> 00:29:53.400
She is the new Town Mayor, Li Qiuping.

00:29:54.039 --> 00:29:57.319
She's come all the way
from Paris, France.

00:29:57.799 --> 00:30:00.319
Don't miss out as you pass by!

00:30:11.160 --> 00:30:12.279
Mr. Zheng, Mr. Xie.

00:30:12.720 --> 00:30:13.440
Need a ride?

00:30:13.592 --> 00:30:14.480
I'll give you a lift.

00:30:14.880 --> 00:30:15.400
No, no need.

00:30:15.559 --> 00:30:16.400
We're almost there.

00:30:17.759 --> 00:30:18.880
Walking's good exercise.

00:30:19.920 --> 00:30:20.599
Excuse me.

00:30:20.599 --> 00:30:21.976
(Yuehai Town People's Government)

00:30:29.400 --> 00:30:30.200
Mr. Zheng.

00:30:30.599 --> 00:30:31.400
Mr. Xie.

00:30:32.240 --> 00:30:33.359
Thank you so much.

00:30:33.759 --> 00:30:36.799
Now the whole town should know me.

00:30:36.960 --> 00:30:39.759
So we can move ahead smoothly, right?

00:30:40.696 --> 00:30:41.119
Right.

00:30:44.559 --> 00:30:44.960
Okay.

00:30:49.559 --> 00:30:51.720
Everyone, please pause your work

00:30:51.759 --> 00:30:52.440
and come out.

00:30:53.440 --> 00:30:55.079
Our new Town Mayor, Ms. Li,

00:30:55.480 --> 00:30:56.880
wants to clean up the town.

00:30:57.559 --> 00:30:58.960
If anyone has time,

00:30:59.000 --> 00:31:00.519
lend her a hand, okay?

00:31:00.920 --> 00:31:03.319
Mr. Zhang, from publicity, you!

00:31:05.079 --> 00:31:06.200
You've got a meeting?

00:31:06.720 --> 00:31:07.960
Then, Accountant Liu.

00:31:08.559 --> 00:31:09.176
You...

00:31:09.592 --> 00:31:10.680
Reconciling accounts.

00:31:10.680 --> 00:31:11.880
Reconcile accounts. Okay.

00:31:12.359 --> 00:31:12.920
Zhou.

00:31:13.920 --> 00:31:14.920
Zhou is busy?

00:31:15.079 --> 00:31:15.680
Xie.

00:31:17.880 --> 00:31:18.400
Coming.

00:31:18.400 --> 00:31:19.519
Xie has no time either.

00:31:19.839 --> 00:31:21.720
So nobody has time?

00:31:22.240 --> 00:31:23.559
- No.
- No.

00:31:23.839 --> 00:31:24.680
Ms. Li, see?

00:31:24.839 --> 00:31:25.839
Everyone's tied up.

00:31:25.839 --> 00:31:26.640
What should we do?

00:31:27.160 --> 00:31:28.359
Yang Village demolition

00:31:28.359 --> 00:31:29.359
must be handled.

00:31:29.359 --> 00:31:29.960
I know.

00:31:29.960 --> 00:31:31.279
One thing at a time, okay?

00:31:31.359 --> 00:31:32.279
Alright.

00:31:32.880 --> 00:31:33.960
See?

00:31:34.039 --> 00:31:34.759
I told you.

00:31:34.759 --> 00:31:35.720
Everyone's busy.

00:31:36.079 --> 00:31:37.720
Well, you can ask them yourself.

00:31:38.616 --> 00:31:39.039
Okay.

00:31:39.799 --> 00:31:40.799
Let's go.

00:31:42.240 --> 00:31:42.720
No need.

00:32:01.160 --> 00:32:01.960
Meng Xiaoli.

00:32:05.319 --> 00:32:06.279
Meng Xiaoli!

00:32:09.000 --> 00:32:09.920
Little Conch!

00:32:15.839 --> 00:32:16.519
Okay.

00:32:16.599 --> 00:32:17.799
Go!

00:32:18.559 --> 00:32:19.920
Don't mess around. Go!

00:32:19.920 --> 00:32:20.279
Come on.

00:32:20.319 --> 00:32:21.839
Let's go.

00:32:33.359 --> 00:32:34.559
This area's all yours.

00:32:35.440 --> 00:32:36.480
I sweep faster than you.

00:32:39.880 --> 00:32:41.440
Start from the small things.

00:32:41.519 --> 00:32:43.039
Be a civilized resident.

00:32:44.799 --> 00:32:46.920
Our sanitation really needs fixing.

00:32:47.599 --> 00:32:49.119
Look. It's such a mess.

00:32:49.119 --> 00:32:49.519
Exactly.

00:32:50.200 --> 00:32:51.400
It won't work.

00:32:51.759 --> 00:32:53.440
In a couple of days, it'll be the same.

00:32:53.519 --> 00:32:53.960
Just wait.

00:32:54.160 --> 00:32:56.200
A new broom sweeps clean.

00:32:56.720 --> 00:32:57.799
What if it improves?

00:32:58.240 --> 00:32:59.359
- Yeah.
- Right.

00:32:59.799 --> 00:33:00.359
Who knows?

00:33:00.559 --> 00:33:02.519
Maybe our village will get better.

00:33:03.400 --> 00:33:04.000
True.

00:33:05.119 --> 00:33:05.640
Besides,

00:33:05.799 --> 00:33:08.119
I kind of like the new Town Mayor.

00:33:08.119 --> 00:33:08.720
Qiang.

00:33:09.000 --> 00:33:10.960
We found the guy
who cursed you at the opening.

00:33:11.359 --> 00:33:12.240
They sent word.

00:33:12.480 --> 00:33:13.079
For a fight.

00:33:14.319 --> 00:33:15.839
Bring it on. We're not scared.

00:33:16.000 --> 00:33:17.720
- Let's get them!
- Yeah!

00:33:21.400 --> 00:33:22.240
Qiang, they're here.

00:33:23.680 --> 00:33:25.000
- Qiang!
- Hey, you.

00:33:25.000 --> 00:33:26.400
All wear the clothes I borrowed?

00:33:26.400 --> 00:33:27.440
- Yes.
- Yes.

00:33:28.359 --> 00:33:29.039
Be careful.

00:33:29.039 --> 00:33:29.688
Keep clean.

00:33:29.688 --> 00:33:30.400
I'll return them.

00:33:30.400 --> 00:33:31.128
- Okay.
- Alright.

00:33:31.128 --> 00:33:31.864
Take off jackets.

00:33:36.024 --> 00:33:39.096
(Jiangku Martial Arts Team)

00:33:39.096 --> 00:33:39.519
Let's go.

00:33:40.039 --> 00:33:40.400
Go!

00:33:44.559 --> 00:33:45.000
Well...

00:33:45.839 --> 00:33:46.599
All right then.

00:33:46.720 --> 00:33:50.440
The county's
land acquisition decision is out.

00:33:50.599 --> 00:33:52.160
Let's stop arguing

00:33:52.200 --> 00:33:53.759
and sign the contract.

00:33:54.400 --> 00:33:54.839
Mr. Tan.

00:33:55.200 --> 00:33:57.079
Let's stick to the price
we agreed on earlier.

00:33:57.319 --> 00:33:58.039
If not that price,

00:33:58.119 --> 00:33:59.640
we can't sign it.

00:34:00.160 --> 00:34:00.519
Wait.

00:34:00.960 --> 00:34:01.839
Yang, Deng.

00:34:01.880 --> 00:34:03.640
You're really going too far.

00:34:04.000 --> 00:34:04.400
Anyway,

00:34:06.200 --> 00:34:06.960
not at that price,

00:34:07.680 --> 00:34:09.599
we won't release the land.

00:34:09.800 --> 00:34:12.199
Even if county leaders come,

00:34:12.239 --> 00:34:12.960
same answer.

00:34:13.440 --> 00:34:13.800
Exactly.

00:34:15.960 --> 00:34:16.440
Mr. Zheng!

00:34:17.360 --> 00:34:17.840
Mr. Zheng.

00:34:20.440 --> 00:34:21.000
Come on.

00:34:21.360 --> 00:34:22.519
Let me introduce you.

00:34:22.904 --> 00:34:25.320
This is Director Zhang,
from the State-owned Cable Factory.

00:34:25.320 --> 00:34:26.000
Hello, Mr. Zhang.

00:34:26.039 --> 00:34:27.280
- This Mr. Yang.
- Hello.

00:34:27.320 --> 00:34:27.840
Mr. Deng.

00:34:28.119 --> 00:34:29.679
And Mr. Tan.

00:34:30.639 --> 00:34:33.280
This land is for their factory.

00:34:34.679 --> 00:34:35.280
How about it?

00:34:35.719 --> 00:34:37.000
When can we sign the contract?

00:34:46.000 --> 00:34:48.519
This is Captain Zheng Zhiqiang
of Jiangku Martial Arts Team.

00:34:49.280 --> 00:34:50.800
Hai from Yang Village.

00:34:51.559 --> 00:34:52.400
Which school are you?

00:34:53.079 --> 00:34:54.119
Free style.

00:35:00.320 --> 00:35:01.208
- Respect.
- Respect.

00:35:02.239 --> 00:35:02.760
Hei.

00:35:03.280 --> 00:35:04.880
If anything happens to me today,

00:35:05.119 --> 00:35:06.119
take care of my grandma.

00:35:06.599 --> 00:35:07.480
Don't worry.

00:35:08.039 --> 00:35:08.539
Zhuang.

00:35:09.360 --> 00:35:10.719
If anything happens to me today,

00:35:10.880 --> 00:35:12.000
take care of my parents.

00:35:12.320 --> 00:35:13.079
Got it, Qiang.

00:35:14.880 --> 00:35:16.159
One by one

00:35:16.400 --> 00:35:17.280
or all at once?

00:35:17.719 --> 00:35:18.800
If we all attack at once,

00:35:18.880 --> 00:35:20.559
people might say we bullied you.

00:35:21.360 --> 00:35:21.860
Bao,

00:35:22.440 --> 00:35:24.599
show him our Jiangku sweep kick.

00:35:25.199 --> 00:35:25.519
Okay!

00:35:33.679 --> 00:35:34.599
- Great!
- Great!

00:35:38.000 --> 00:35:40.199
- Great!
- Great!

00:35:40.400 --> 00:35:41.079
Zhuang, go!

00:35:54.639 --> 00:35:56.519
- Great!
- Great!

00:35:56.519 --> 00:35:57.039
Yu.

00:35:57.320 --> 00:35:57.800
Go!

00:35:57.800 --> 00:35:59.199
- Go!
- Good!

00:36:00.960 --> 00:36:01.519
Dragon!

00:36:02.559 --> 00:36:03.079
Snake!

00:36:03.920 --> 00:36:04.400
Tiger!

00:36:05.800 --> 00:36:06.320
Crane!

00:36:09.000 --> 00:36:09.440
Leopard!

00:36:13.000 --> 00:36:15.760
- Great!
- Great!

00:36:15.760 --> 00:36:16.480
Amazing!

00:36:16.760 --> 00:36:17.480
Who's next?

00:36:19.000 --> 00:36:19.960
Okay.

00:36:20.679 --> 00:36:21.239
I get it.

00:36:22.000 --> 00:36:23.320
That's enough.

00:36:23.519 --> 00:36:24.639
Just five hundred yuan.

00:36:24.920 --> 00:36:25.920
Don't drag this out.

00:36:26.360 --> 00:36:28.400
Compensation isn't up to me anyway.

00:36:28.800 --> 00:36:29.519
Besides,

00:36:30.159 --> 00:36:31.480
a state-owned factory moving in

00:36:31.840 --> 00:36:32.519
is a great thing.

00:36:33.079 --> 00:36:34.440
Think about the long-term gains.

00:36:35.639 --> 00:36:36.320
Mr. Zheng.

00:36:37.239 --> 00:36:38.599
We have no choice either.

00:36:38.760 --> 00:36:40.000
Immediate gains?

00:36:40.039 --> 00:36:40.960
Long-term benefits?

00:36:41.280 --> 00:36:42.920
We tried persuading the villagers,

00:36:43.760 --> 00:36:44.840
but they won't listen.

00:36:44.920 --> 00:36:45.559
Right.

00:36:55.928 --> 00:36:57.239
Jiangku Martial Arts Team?

00:36:57.239 --> 00:36:57.816
Yeah?

00:36:59.000 --> 00:37:00.239
- Good!
- Good!

00:37:00.280 --> 00:37:01.760
We're fighting you!

00:37:02.000 --> 00:37:07.079
- Good!
- Good!

00:37:18.280 --> 00:37:18.880
Stop shouting!

00:37:19.239 --> 00:37:20.320
What are you doing?

00:37:20.599 --> 00:37:21.079
Stop!

00:37:21.320 --> 00:37:22.039
Stop it!

00:37:22.039 --> 00:37:22.880
Mr. Zheng!

00:37:23.920 --> 00:37:25.119
He hit me!

00:37:25.519 --> 00:37:26.599
What are you up to here?

00:37:27.239 --> 00:37:27.800
Get back, now!

00:37:31.360 --> 00:37:32.000
Don't move!

00:37:33.159 --> 00:37:34.079
Who are you?

00:37:35.119 --> 00:37:35.800
My village.

00:37:36.119 --> 00:37:37.519
They are just fooling around.

00:37:42.840 --> 00:37:45.199
They are strong young men.

00:37:46.119 --> 00:37:46.880
Not working,

00:37:47.599 --> 00:37:48.440
but loitering here?

00:37:49.320 --> 00:37:50.440
Jobs are hard to come by.

00:37:50.960 --> 00:37:51.800
No work available.

00:38:04.360 --> 00:38:04.800
Mr. Zhang.

00:38:04.960 --> 00:38:05.639
Nonsense.

00:38:09.440 --> 00:38:10.239
These young guys.

00:38:11.320 --> 00:38:11.960
Take them on,

00:38:12.480 --> 00:38:12.960
okay?

00:38:15.800 --> 00:38:17.519
Help me with that.

00:38:18.000 --> 00:38:20.159
I guarantee I'll secure that land.

00:38:25.848 --> 00:38:26.584
Okay.

00:38:27.512 --> 00:38:28.248
No problem.

00:38:28.440 --> 00:38:29.519
I'll think of a way.

00:38:30.900 --> 00:38:31.400
Deal.

00:38:32.079 --> 00:38:32.800
Keep your word.

00:38:33.760 --> 00:38:34.260
Okay.

00:38:36.079 --> 00:38:37.400
Mr. Yang, Mr. Deng.

00:38:37.880 --> 00:38:39.800
Your young people are lucky.

00:38:40.639 --> 00:38:42.320
Mr. Zhang just agreed

00:38:42.599 --> 00:38:44.119
that once the factory moves in,

00:38:44.559 --> 00:38:46.159
he will give you worker quotas.

00:38:46.639 --> 00:38:48.960
State-owned, official positions.

00:38:49.440 --> 00:38:50.800
Great news, right?

00:38:51.199 --> 00:38:52.199
That's fantastic!

00:38:53.208 --> 00:38:54.168
Such a great chance.

00:38:54.168 --> 00:38:55.599
Show your stance to him.

00:38:56.960 --> 00:38:58.000
Is this for real?

00:38:59.440 --> 00:39:00.559
Don't trust me?

00:39:01.199 --> 00:39:01.840
Mr. Zhang.

00:39:02.079 --> 00:39:03.320
Let's make our position clear.

00:39:03.840 --> 00:39:05.320
We'll sign the contract shortly.

00:39:07.239 --> 00:39:08.000
No problem.

00:39:08.239 --> 00:39:08.760
That's great.

00:39:09.039 --> 00:39:10.960
We will have state-salaried workers.

00:39:11.159 --> 00:39:12.519
Yes! State enterprise workers!

00:39:13.119 --> 00:39:13.840
Yang, Deng.

00:39:13.960 --> 00:39:15.039
Well, in that case.

00:39:15.079 --> 00:39:17.519
Let's push the demolition quickly, okay?

00:39:17.559 --> 00:39:19.320
And the price, go with what was agreed.

00:39:19.360 --> 00:39:20.159
Let's stop arguing.

00:39:20.440 --> 00:39:21.639
We'll go back and discuss.

00:39:21.639 --> 00:39:22.360
Right. Discuss.

00:39:22.360 --> 00:39:23.400
What's there to discuss?

00:39:23.960 --> 00:39:24.599
No discussions.

00:39:25.599 --> 00:39:27.039
Even if you don't trust Mr. Zhang,

00:39:27.320 --> 00:39:28.360
you can trust me. Right?

00:39:28.360 --> 00:39:29.320
We trust you.

00:39:29.480 --> 00:39:31.199
I'll write a guarantee. Okay?

00:39:31.256 --> 00:39:32.664
If I don't deliver, I'm a turtle.

00:39:33.400 --> 00:39:33.760
No.

00:39:33.760 --> 00:39:35.159
I've raised one before.

00:39:35.559 --> 00:39:36.039
I know it.

00:39:36.599 --> 00:39:36.960
Okay?

00:39:37.719 --> 00:39:38.440
Okay.

00:39:40.199 --> 00:39:41.239
Mr. Deng. Mr. Yang.

00:39:41.559 --> 00:39:43.360
We're all Party members, aren't we?

00:39:43.719 --> 00:39:44.840
We all serve the people.

00:39:45.360 --> 00:39:47.360
Don't haggle over small gains.

00:39:47.719 --> 00:39:48.800
Think long-term.

00:39:49.199 --> 00:39:50.039
- Yes.
- Okay.

00:39:50.360 --> 00:39:52.280
Then, let's go sign the contract.

00:39:52.679 --> 00:39:53.840
Okay, sign the contract.

00:39:54.360 --> 00:39:54.960
Okay.

00:39:54.960 --> 00:39:56.559
Mr. Zhang, let's go. Sign the contract.

00:39:56.800 --> 00:39:57.320
Alright.

00:39:57.480 --> 00:39:59.159
This way. Please.

00:39:59.159 --> 00:40:00.400
Mr. Zhang, this way.

00:40:01.719 --> 00:40:02.320
Go home.

00:40:06.119 --> 00:40:06.840
Everyone, go home.

00:40:08.480 --> 00:40:09.679
Please, this way.

00:40:09.760 --> 00:40:10.880
- This way.
- Right.

00:40:12.159 --> 00:40:12.679
Qiang.

00:40:12.880 --> 00:40:13.440
Continue?

00:40:14.639 --> 00:40:15.360
You go then?

00:40:31.320 --> 00:40:31.960
Bro.

00:40:32.880 --> 00:40:33.519
Congratulations.

00:40:35.519 --> 00:40:38.360
That Mr. Zheng is my uncle.

00:40:39.159 --> 00:40:39.840
Blood uncle.

00:40:40.519 --> 00:40:41.079
What about it?

00:40:43.079 --> 00:40:43.800
So what?

00:40:44.159 --> 00:40:45.079
I don't raise turtles.

00:40:47.960 --> 00:40:49.519
I think you've got skills.

00:40:50.480 --> 00:40:52.280
You've got skills. I've got connections.

00:40:52.880 --> 00:40:54.440
If we join forces,

00:40:55.039 --> 00:40:56.840
Yuehai will be ours.

00:40:57.480 --> 00:40:58.000
Deal?

00:41:25.719 --> 00:41:26.219
Let's go.

00:41:45.480 --> 00:41:46.599
Let's call it a day for now.

00:41:47.280 --> 00:41:48.280
You've worked hard.

00:41:48.440 --> 00:41:49.079
Not at all.

00:41:49.840 --> 00:41:52.599
We cleaned this road so well today.

00:41:52.920 --> 00:41:53.920
I believe soon

00:41:54.119 --> 00:41:55.440
the whole Yuehai will be clean.

00:42:11.039 --> 00:42:12.119
I'm good at it.

00:42:12.599 --> 00:42:13.320
No, no need.

00:42:31.400 --> 00:42:32.360
Ms. Li.

00:42:33.360 --> 00:42:35.000
Maybe we should go back.

00:42:36.039 --> 00:42:38.639
Just quit the sanitation work.

00:42:40.639 --> 00:42:41.239
Meng.

00:42:41.639 --> 00:42:42.239
Look.

00:42:43.440 --> 00:42:44.880
This isn't a sanitation issue.

00:42:45.239 --> 00:42:47.079
It's a habit problem.

00:42:54.456 --> 00:42:55.096
Well...

00:42:56.200 --> 00:42:57.880
What should we do, Ms. Li?

00:43:01.000 --> 00:43:01.880
