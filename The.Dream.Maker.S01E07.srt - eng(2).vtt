00:01:38.712 --> 00:01:40.393
There's no starting over.

00:01:41.152 --> 00:01:43.673
A sanitation blitz for one day is fine,

00:01:44.152 --> 00:01:46.273
but it can't be a permanent thing.

00:01:46.712 --> 00:01:47.993
Who can handle it every day?

00:01:48.913 --> 00:01:49.913
You know it.

00:01:50.312 --> 00:01:53.712
Yesterday we just made do
with steamed buns and pickles.

00:01:53.952 --> 00:01:55.592
We can't live like that every day.

00:01:56.312 --> 00:01:58.512
I have to cook three meals a day.

00:01:59.952 --> 00:02:01.400
I'm not afraid of hard work.

00:02:01.816 --> 00:02:03.096
It's just not sustainable.

00:02:07.352 --> 00:02:08.462
Ms. Li,

00:02:09.176 --> 00:02:11.256
I can't move today.

00:02:11.592 --> 00:02:13.833
I'm not a young man.

00:02:14.592 --> 00:02:16.472
After yesterday's work,

00:02:17.312 --> 00:02:19.632
my body really hurts.

00:02:22.192 --> 00:02:24.273
I can't move.

00:02:25.312 --> 00:02:26.152
Understood.

00:02:27.353 --> 00:02:28.472
Have a good rest.

00:02:29.752 --> 00:02:30.252
Okay.

00:02:35.632 --> 00:02:36.393
Nice shot!

00:02:37.073 --> 00:02:38.192
Got it in one hit!

00:02:47.073 --> 00:02:48.273
Next!

00:02:49.553 --> 00:02:50.393
Please, Mr. Xie.

00:02:54.432 --> 00:02:55.472
Mr. Xie, go!

00:02:55.472 --> 00:02:57.273
Mr. Xie, go!

00:02:57.632 --> 00:02:59.513
- Mr. Xie, go!
- Mr. Xie, go!

00:03:06.233 --> 00:03:06.733
Take this!

00:03:14.793 --> 00:03:15.673
It doesn't count!

00:03:15.673 --> 00:03:16.953
It's one-ball decider.

00:03:16.953 --> 00:03:18.233
What are you yelling about?

00:03:19.152 --> 00:03:19.872
Let the young...

00:03:20.032 --> 00:03:21.113
Come here.

00:03:21.393 --> 00:03:22.673
What are you doing?

00:03:22.793 --> 00:03:23.872
Chen is amazing.

00:03:24.073 --> 00:03:25.872
None of us could beat her.

00:03:26.673 --> 00:03:27.192
Really?

00:03:28.032 --> 00:03:28.752
That good?

00:03:29.472 --> 00:03:30.073
Let me try.

00:03:30.113 --> 00:03:30.613
Go ahead.

00:03:31.592 --> 00:03:33.793
Hit to her middle-right with spin.

00:03:34.833 --> 00:03:36.513
No need for your advice.

00:03:37.872 --> 00:03:39.833
If you can beat me,

00:03:40.353 --> 00:03:42.432
I'll recommend you
to the city sports school.

00:03:42.493 --> 00:03:43.793
I'll write the recommendation.

00:03:44.032 --> 00:03:45.833
Mr. Zheng, you keep your word?

00:03:46.632 --> 00:03:48.152
When have I not?

00:03:48.793 --> 00:03:49.472
Come on.

00:03:50.454 --> 00:03:51.064
See?

00:03:51.064 --> 00:03:52.912
Y-Your paddle is great.

00:03:53.472 --> 00:03:54.353
You...

00:03:54.632 --> 00:03:55.872
She's just skilled.

00:03:56.912 --> 00:03:57.712
Pure talent.

00:03:58.912 --> 00:03:59.412
Wu.

00:03:59.712 --> 00:04:00.953
Can I borrow your knife?

00:04:00.993 --> 00:04:02.273
This is really sharp.

00:04:02.752 --> 00:04:03.353
Let me try.

00:04:03.793 --> 00:04:04.393
Be careful.

00:04:04.993 --> 00:04:05.912
Why take a knife?

00:04:05.993 --> 00:04:06.793
It might fly out.

00:04:06.833 --> 00:04:08.592
Mr. Zheng, I can play with this.

00:04:08.752 --> 00:04:09.793
Be careful.

00:04:09.793 --> 00:04:12.513
Don't swing it over here and hit me.

00:04:17.473 --> 00:04:18.153
She made it.

00:04:18.793 --> 00:04:19.293
Nice shot!

00:04:23.113 --> 00:04:23.632
Mr. Zheng.

00:04:23.713 --> 00:04:24.553
You can't match her!

00:04:24.713 --> 00:04:25.952
Write the letter!

00:04:26.192 --> 00:04:26.692
Okay.

00:04:26.913 --> 00:04:28.872
I'll write the recommendation.

00:04:28.952 --> 00:04:29.713
Come on.

00:04:29.832 --> 00:04:31.192
Give it up, Xie.

00:04:31.392 --> 00:04:31.993
Really?

00:04:32.593 --> 00:04:33.233
Really?

00:04:34.632 --> 00:04:35.713
It's my turn.

00:04:45.432 --> 00:04:47.153
Little Conch!

00:04:49.353 --> 00:04:50.793
Where's Ms. Li and Meng?

00:04:53.033 --> 00:04:54.353
Probably still on the street.

00:04:55.153 --> 00:04:56.432
Haven't come back for dinner.

00:04:56.913 --> 00:04:58.153
What are they doing out?

00:04:59.113 --> 00:04:59.613
Well...

00:04:59.913 --> 00:05:01.593
- Where've they gone?
- Ping'an Road.

00:05:02.232 --> 00:05:04.600
(Pitch in, keep it clean.
No public urination here.)

00:05:16.248 --> 00:05:19.288
(Pitch in, keep it clean.
No public urination here.)

00:05:20.832 --> 00:05:22.913
No peeing here! I'm watching you!

00:05:23.153 --> 00:05:25.353
Hey! You scared me half to death.

00:05:26.432 --> 00:05:27.512
Why aren't you two back?

00:05:27.553 --> 00:05:28.473
It's late.

00:05:28.913 --> 00:05:31.072
Mr. Zheng. What are you doing here?

00:05:31.072 --> 00:05:32.632
I thought it was someone peeing.

00:05:32.913 --> 00:05:35.153
What are you two
doing out here at this time?

00:05:35.153 --> 00:05:35.768
Don't open it!

00:05:36.216 --> 00:05:37.392
Too many mosquitoes outside.

00:05:37.392 --> 00:05:38.512
We won't go out.

00:05:39.593 --> 00:05:41.312
Mr. Zheng, why are you here?

00:05:41.913 --> 00:05:44.632
Not back for dinner,
what are you doing here?

00:05:45.512 --> 00:05:46.752
We're on duty.

00:05:47.033 --> 00:05:47.913
What duty?

00:05:48.473 --> 00:05:50.993
Stopping littering and public urination.

00:05:52.033 --> 00:05:54.593
Nonsense! Who'd be out this late?

00:05:54.632 --> 00:05:56.072
What if you run into bad people?

00:05:56.512 --> 00:05:57.072
Get back now.

00:05:57.192 --> 00:05:57.952
It's fine.

00:05:58.392 --> 00:05:59.952
Look, I brought weapons.

00:06:00.473 --> 00:06:01.673
You... That's terrifying.

00:06:01.913 --> 00:06:02.512
Alright.

00:06:02.752 --> 00:06:04.233
No one'd be out this late.

00:06:04.673 --> 00:06:05.272
Go home now.

00:06:09.153 --> 00:06:10.432
No peeing here!

00:06:10.752 --> 00:06:11.512
Stop it!

00:06:12.512 --> 00:06:13.913
Peeing on my bike?

00:06:13.952 --> 00:06:15.312
Why not pee on my head instead?

00:06:15.913 --> 00:06:16.673
I can't hold it.

00:06:16.673 --> 00:06:17.832
You're challenging me.

00:06:18.432 --> 00:06:19.233
Stay right there!

00:06:19.572 --> 00:06:20.832
I'll take you somewhere else.

00:06:21.473 --> 00:06:22.233
Behave!

00:06:24.053 --> 00:06:24.553
Okay.

00:06:24.553 --> 00:06:25.832
Hurry up!

00:06:25.832 --> 00:06:27.872
Eat up. It's still hot.

00:06:28.392 --> 00:06:29.033
Thank you.

00:06:29.113 --> 00:06:31.353
If you run into trouble, shout loudly.

00:06:32.312 --> 00:06:33.713
The locals here will help.

00:06:34.353 --> 00:06:35.072
Got it.

00:06:35.272 --> 00:06:35.993
Safety first.

00:06:36.673 --> 00:06:37.173
Okay.

00:06:37.312 --> 00:06:38.233
Thank you, Mr. Zheng.

00:06:39.312 --> 00:06:40.752
Look at you.

00:06:41.673 --> 00:06:43.312
Why drink so much water at night?

00:06:43.752 --> 00:06:45.473
Get on. I'll take you elsewhere.

00:06:47.033 --> 00:06:48.033
Don't pee here again.

00:06:48.673 --> 00:06:49.173
Let's eat.

00:06:53.392 --> 00:06:54.113
Two meat buns.

00:06:54.512 --> 00:06:55.233
Hi.

00:06:58.312 --> 00:06:59.312
Hello.

00:06:59.473 --> 00:07:00.233
This is it?

00:07:00.233 --> 00:07:00.793
Yes.

00:07:00.793 --> 00:07:01.473
Also.

00:07:01.473 --> 00:07:02.072
Are we here?

00:07:03.272 --> 00:07:04.673
Yeah, it's here.

00:07:05.464 --> 00:07:07.153
That's all, boarding.

00:07:16.504 --> 00:07:17.432
Just a good place.

00:07:17.752 --> 00:07:19.312
Stop!

00:07:19.952 --> 00:07:20.673
Hello.

00:07:20.872 --> 00:07:21.392
Hello.

00:07:21.392 --> 00:07:22.312
You... Who are you?

00:07:22.752 --> 00:07:23.793
What "Hello"?

00:07:24.033 --> 00:07:24.832
I don't understand.

00:07:24.993 --> 00:07:26.512
Where are you from?

00:07:26.593 --> 00:07:27.312
Why come here?

00:07:27.832 --> 00:07:29.872
We're looking for someone.

00:07:30.192 --> 00:07:30.793
For whom?

00:07:31.473 --> 00:07:32.192
Monica?

00:07:33.832 --> 00:07:34.593
Qiuping!

00:07:36.033 --> 00:07:37.233
She's coming.

00:07:37.632 --> 00:07:38.553
Your friends?

00:07:39.192 --> 00:07:39.832
Monica!

00:07:40.272 --> 00:07:41.312
Qiuping!

00:07:42.993 --> 00:07:45.392
Long time no see.
I've missed you so much!

00:07:45.473 --> 00:07:47.673
I can't believe you're here.

00:07:49.353 --> 00:07:50.353
Let me introduce you.

00:07:50.832 --> 00:07:52.432
This is my band.

00:07:52.632 --> 00:07:53.553
My drummer.

00:07:53.673 --> 00:07:54.993
- I'm Steve.
- Steve.

00:07:55.793 --> 00:07:57.952
- My guitarist.
- I'm David.

00:07:58.153 --> 00:07:58.952
And bassist, Mark.

00:07:59.353 --> 00:08:00.192
Nice to meet you.

00:08:00.192 --> 00:08:02.793
Hello, I'm Li Qiuping, the Town Mayor.

00:08:03.553 --> 00:08:05.872
Monica is my longtime friend.

00:08:06.312 --> 00:08:07.752
Welcome to Yuehai.

00:08:07.993 --> 00:08:09.033
Yes!

00:08:09.153 --> 00:08:10.473
Yuehai!

00:08:12.832 --> 00:08:15.272
We biked for eight hours to get here,

00:08:15.752 --> 00:08:19.072
and rented these bikes in Nanzhou.

00:08:19.288 --> 00:08:20.153
(Dare to explore. Dare to act.)
So cool!

00:08:20.153 --> 00:08:21.072
(Work hard. Unite for Yuehai.)

00:08:21.072 --> 00:08:23.793
My fault. I should've sent a car.

00:08:24.832 --> 00:08:26.593
No need. We're here now.

00:08:31.913 --> 00:08:32.993
Who are they?

00:08:33.593 --> 00:08:35.152
Cadres from our town government.

00:08:35.433 --> 00:08:37.792
Mr. Tan and Mr. Xie, both deputy mayors.

00:08:39.593 --> 00:08:41.032
Nice to meet you.

00:08:41.833 --> 00:08:42.333
Hi.

00:08:43.593 --> 00:08:44.833
He's not used to this.

00:08:45.493 --> 00:08:45.993
Sorry.

00:08:45.993 --> 00:08:47.152
It's fine.

00:08:47.473 --> 00:08:48.752
Nice to meet you.

00:08:50.672 --> 00:08:53.132
Chinese great cadres, right?

00:08:53.313 --> 00:08:55.713
Chinese great cadres.

00:08:55.953 --> 00:08:56.953
Ms. Li's friends, right?

00:08:57.272 --> 00:08:57.772
Yes.

00:08:57.912 --> 00:08:59.392
Monica came specifically to see me.

00:08:59.473 --> 00:09:00.272
Foreign friends.

00:09:00.872 --> 00:09:01.372
Great.

00:09:01.752 --> 00:09:04.073
Monica, let me show you around.

00:09:04.233 --> 00:09:04.792
Great.

00:09:05.993 --> 00:09:06.493
Okay.

00:09:07.193 --> 00:09:08.392
Is this where you work?

00:09:08.392 --> 00:09:08.892
Yes.

00:09:08.912 --> 00:09:10.272
Nice.

00:09:11.953 --> 00:09:13.688
- That's our canteen.
- Ms. Li is great.

00:09:14.872 --> 00:09:17.792
- Ms. Li seems the most normal.
- This is...

00:09:37.032 --> 00:09:39.632
Ms. Li, who are they?

00:09:39.912 --> 00:09:41.632
They're my friends from abroad.

00:09:42.752 --> 00:09:43.593
Want to join?

00:09:44.872 --> 00:09:45.792
I'll pass.

00:09:46.313 --> 00:09:48.752
My English is not great.

00:09:49.113 --> 00:09:50.193
They can speak Chinese.

00:09:52.632 --> 00:09:53.912
And they're a band.

00:09:54.392 --> 00:09:56.752
You can communicate with music.
Music has no borders.

00:09:57.593 --> 00:09:58.152
Really?

00:09:59.113 --> 00:10:02.032
Then I'll go wash up, change clothes,

00:10:02.512 --> 00:10:03.473
and get my guitar.

00:10:03.792 --> 00:10:04.392
Thanks, Ms. Li.

00:10:04.552 --> 00:10:05.052
We'll wait.

00:10:05.752 --> 00:10:06.512
Bring your guitar.

00:10:07.313 --> 00:10:07.833
Got it.

00:10:11.593 --> 00:10:13.593
Even if they are foreigners,

00:10:14.152 --> 00:10:16.353
dressing like this,
don't their parents care?

00:10:17.233 --> 00:10:19.433
Even if parents don't, teachers should.

00:10:21.473 --> 00:10:23.193
What are you muttering? Are you hungry?

00:10:23.833 --> 00:10:24.993
No. I think they dress...

00:10:25.193 --> 00:10:27.272
You want to join? Why didn't you go?

00:10:27.272 --> 00:10:28.953
I don't want at all. You go if you want.

00:10:29.172 --> 00:10:30.593
Why didn't you keep an eye on them?

00:10:30.593 --> 00:10:31.512
What if they overspend?

00:10:31.872 --> 00:10:33.752
You watch me all day. Why not go?

00:10:34.073 --> 00:10:35.032
I'm not watching you.

00:10:35.113 --> 00:10:37.392
Ms. Li already gave me the money.
They're self-funded.

00:10:38.672 --> 00:10:39.512
Nothing to supervise.

00:10:39.833 --> 00:10:41.113
Yeah. It's good.

00:10:42.073 --> 00:10:42.993
Not bad.

00:10:43.113 --> 00:10:43.632
It's good.

00:10:43.953 --> 00:10:44.912
It likes... Let me...

00:10:45.113 --> 00:10:45.752
Great.

00:10:46.953 --> 00:10:47.632
Mark

00:10:48.032 --> 00:10:51.152
studied directing in college.

00:10:51.552 --> 00:10:53.073
So, this time,

00:10:53.313 --> 00:10:54.233
his first task here

00:10:54.313 --> 00:10:56.313
is to shoot a documentary.

00:10:57.193 --> 00:10:57.953
A documentary?

00:10:58.113 --> 00:10:58.613
Yes.

00:11:00.912 --> 00:11:02.953
The first task. Is there another task?

00:11:03.313 --> 00:11:05.872
Another task is from my dad.

00:11:06.752 --> 00:11:10.152
He said domestic development is booming,

00:11:10.713 --> 00:11:12.993
especially our hometown
along the Dongjiang coast.

00:11:13.353 --> 00:11:16.313
The next decade looks great.

00:11:16.792 --> 00:11:17.512
My grandpa

00:11:17.632 --> 00:11:20.593
sees a map of China every day,

00:11:20.593 --> 00:11:22.073
saying he misses home terribly.

00:11:22.353 --> 00:11:24.272
He wants us to catch this wave.

00:11:24.552 --> 00:11:26.593
So my dad asked me to come back,

00:11:26.752 --> 00:11:29.512
and see if there's anything
worth investing in.

00:11:30.993 --> 00:11:31.713
Investing?

00:11:32.912 --> 00:11:35.953
Anyway, just show me around,

00:11:36.552 --> 00:11:38.433
and see how things are.

00:11:38.552 --> 00:11:39.752
You're the leader here.

00:11:39.953 --> 00:11:41.113
And policies are flexible.

00:11:41.353 --> 00:11:43.152
If acceptable,

00:11:43.512 --> 00:11:45.792
I'll tell my dad to choose here.

00:11:48.392 --> 00:11:49.656
Choose... Here?

00:11:51.313 --> 00:11:51.872
Ms. Li.

00:11:53.953 --> 00:11:54.752
- Mr. Zheng.
- Mr. Zheng.

00:11:55.752 --> 00:11:56.272
Mr. Lin.

00:11:56.272 --> 00:11:56.872
This is...

00:11:57.792 --> 00:11:59.032
My classmate from France,

00:11:59.233 --> 00:12:01.152
Monica, an American Chinese.

00:12:01.993 --> 00:12:03.912
This is Zheng Decheng,
Secretary of Yuehai.

00:12:04.752 --> 00:12:06.032
Secretary?

00:12:08.552 --> 00:12:09.833
What does "Secretary" mean?

00:12:09.912 --> 00:12:11.833
Is he your leader?

00:12:12.193 --> 00:12:12.693
Yeah.

00:12:13.593 --> 00:12:15.353
So, you're a great cadre.

00:12:15.353 --> 00:12:16.792
A Chinese great cadre.

00:12:17.953 --> 00:12:18.453
Chinese...

00:12:18.473 --> 00:12:20.512
Got it. Hello, Mr. Zheng.

00:12:21.552 --> 00:12:22.113
Hello.

00:12:22.512 --> 00:12:23.912
My hands are dirty. Sorry.

00:12:24.813 --> 00:12:25.313
Well...

00:12:25.313 --> 00:12:25.813
It's fine.

00:12:25.912 --> 00:12:27.652
Friends from abroad?

00:12:27.752 --> 00:12:28.252
Yes.

00:12:28.392 --> 00:12:30.752
No wonder you look different.

00:12:31.152 --> 00:12:32.272
Our distinguished guests.

00:12:32.472 --> 00:12:33.336
Distinguished guests.

00:12:33.833 --> 00:12:35.313
Ms. Li, host them well.

00:12:35.313 --> 00:12:35.833
I will.

00:12:36.032 --> 00:12:37.412
Distinguished guests, please sit.

00:12:37.953 --> 00:12:38.713
Come, sit.

00:12:38.713 --> 00:12:39.593
- Bye.
- Bye.

00:12:41.073 --> 00:12:43.353
Monica, I think your idea is excellent.

00:12:43.713 --> 00:12:45.193
I'll report it

00:12:45.512 --> 00:12:47.333
to our great cadre right now.

00:12:47.353 --> 00:12:48.233
Great. Go ahead.

00:12:48.792 --> 00:12:51.096
(Please conserve water)

00:12:52.912 --> 00:12:54.328
I just wonder

00:12:54.328 --> 00:12:57.473
are they men or women?

00:13:00.713 --> 00:13:01.313
Mr. Zheng.

00:13:01.973 --> 00:13:03.512
I have something to discuss with you.

00:13:03.872 --> 00:13:04.372
Go ahead.

00:13:04.752 --> 00:13:07.473
Monica's ancestral home is Dongjiang.

00:13:09.113 --> 00:13:10.953
Her grandpa went to the US,

00:13:11.473 --> 00:13:13.272
and now her dad is in Los Angeles.

00:13:14.672 --> 00:13:15.172
And?

00:13:15.392 --> 00:13:18.872
She says her dad wants
to invest back home.

00:13:19.233 --> 00:13:22.073
He's optimistic about China,
especially Yuehai.

00:13:22.412 --> 00:13:24.193
I really want to make it happen.

00:13:24.433 --> 00:13:26.152
At least, leave a good impression.

00:13:26.713 --> 00:13:28.272
Investment? That's excellent news.

00:13:29.152 --> 00:13:30.353
Absolutely excellent news.

00:13:37.113 --> 00:13:37.632
Great!

00:13:40.113 --> 00:13:40.952
(Yuehai Town Master Plan)
Ms. Li.

00:13:41.353 --> 00:13:43.113
Their accommodations are arranged.

00:13:43.792 --> 00:13:44.292
Thanks.

00:13:44.552 --> 00:13:46.552
Tomorrow I'll take them to Ping'an Road.

00:13:46.632 --> 00:13:48.752
Meng and I already cleaned it.

00:13:49.073 --> 00:13:50.152
Why not go to Fuyu Road?

00:13:51.152 --> 00:13:53.233
Because it has been poorly maintained
for too long.

00:13:53.713 --> 00:13:55.353
I can't clean it up in a short time.

00:13:56.032 --> 00:13:57.672
Okay. We'll follow your words.

Ms. Li.

00:15:12.792 --> 00:15:13.292
Morning.

00:15:13.752 --> 00:15:15.912
Meng, have you seen my friend Monica?

00:15:16.912 --> 00:15:17.593
No.

00:15:18.473 --> 00:15:19.833
Where did they go?

00:15:20.193 --> 00:15:20.833
Ms. Li.

00:15:21.672 --> 00:15:22.752
You didn't see them?

00:15:23.433 --> 00:15:27.073
When I woke up, I saw that David.

00:15:27.313 --> 00:15:28.713
And that...

00:15:29.392 --> 00:15:30.672
David...

00:15:30.953 --> 00:15:32.313
Did you see where they went?

00:15:38.632 --> 00:15:39.313
I'm coming.

00:15:39.912 --> 00:15:40.552
I'm coming.

00:15:40.632 --> 00:15:41.240
Little Conch!

00:15:41.656 --> 00:15:42.680
Have you seen them?

00:15:43.233 --> 00:15:43.872
Who?

00:15:44.512 --> 00:15:47.233
Those foreigners... Ms. Li's friends.

00:15:48.152 --> 00:15:49.193
I did see them.

00:15:49.473 --> 00:15:51.073
They went out before dawn broke.

00:15:51.392 --> 00:15:52.032
Went out?

00:15:52.272 --> 00:15:53.193
Why didn't you tell us?

00:15:53.672 --> 00:15:56.073
You were all still asleep.

00:15:56.473 --> 00:15:57.512
They're here on vacation,

00:15:57.512 --> 00:15:59.713
not for work. Why not rest properly?

00:16:00.672 --> 00:16:01.953
I just remembered.

00:16:03.152 --> 00:16:05.353
They're jet-lagged.

00:16:05.632 --> 00:16:07.193
They couldn't sleep right now.

00:16:08.032 --> 00:16:09.433
- Where...
- Where would they go?

00:16:09.433 --> 00:16:10.392
Where could they go?

00:16:13.552 --> 00:16:15.512
I'm worried they went to Fuyu Road.

00:16:17.193 --> 00:16:18.512
(Fuyu Road)
Hai!

00:16:18.632 --> 00:16:19.132
Come on!

00:16:23.032 --> 00:16:24.344
- I guess he's my guy.
- Oh, my God!

00:16:24.512 --> 00:16:25.032
I got this.

00:16:25.032 --> 00:16:26.313
You got this. Got this.

00:16:27.593 --> 00:16:28.512
Great!

00:16:29.392 --> 00:16:30.032
Hai.

00:16:30.152 --> 00:16:30.652
I'll do it!

00:16:30.792 --> 00:16:31.313
Go ahead!

00:16:32.593 --> 00:16:33.713
Go!

00:16:38.168 --> 00:16:39.239
You can do it.

00:16:43.113 --> 00:16:43.953
Nice try!

00:16:44.113 --> 00:16:44.613
Bring it!

00:16:45.353 --> 00:16:45.953
Here it comes!

00:16:46.193 --> 00:16:46.693
Let's go!

00:16:46.833 --> 00:16:48.664
Hai!

00:16:54.473 --> 00:16:55.912
This is our last one.

00:16:57.833 --> 00:16:58.392
We won!

00:16:59.593 --> 00:17:01.552
Can we borrow this?

00:17:02.713 --> 00:17:03.473
This one.

00:17:06.953 --> 00:17:07.633
This thing.

00:17:08.344 --> 00:17:09.304
I'll trade these for it.

00:17:09.713 --> 00:17:14.193
He will give us those
if you let them try the video recorder.

00:17:14.713 --> 00:17:15.272
Just try?

00:17:15.592 --> 00:17:16.592
Yeah. Just try.

00:17:17.633 --> 00:17:18.473
Alright. Come.

00:17:19.512 --> 00:17:20.633
Okay. Give them to her.

00:17:20.792 --> 00:17:22.272
Give me. Give me more.

00:17:22.752 --> 00:17:23.512
Thank you!

00:17:24.512 --> 00:17:25.112
Be careful.

00:17:26.953 --> 00:17:27.453
Give.

00:17:28.032 --> 00:17:29.072
Put it on your shoulder.

00:17:31.072 --> 00:17:32.512
Eyes over here.

00:17:33.552 --> 00:17:34.072
Got it.

00:17:34.512 --> 00:17:35.112
Can you see?

00:17:35.552 --> 00:17:36.193
I see it!

00:17:36.272 --> 00:17:37.393
Can you see us, Hai?

00:17:40.072 --> 00:17:40.592
Quan.

00:17:40.913 --> 00:17:41.752
Can they see us?

00:17:41.752 --> 00:17:42.252
Zoom in.

00:17:43.673 --> 00:17:44.473
Give a try!

00:17:44.752 --> 00:17:45.713
This is how you do it.

00:17:47.352 --> 00:17:47.852
Here.

00:17:48.512 --> 00:17:49.012
Your hands.

00:17:53.552 --> 00:17:55.233
They're really here.

00:17:57.193 --> 00:17:57.693
Xiaoli.

00:17:58.193 --> 00:18:00.873
Bring some vendors over
to distract them.

00:18:00.953 --> 00:18:02.633
I'll stall them.

00:18:02.633 --> 00:18:03.133
Got it.

00:18:03.133 --> 00:18:04.233
(Fuyu Road)

00:18:04.233 --> 00:18:05.312
That's a sweep kick.

00:18:05.433 --> 00:18:06.840
- Aren't you from the martial arts team?
- Monica!

00:18:07.352 --> 00:18:08.032
Monica!

00:18:08.713 --> 00:18:10.512
Qiuping, come here!

00:18:12.713 --> 00:18:14.173
Join us!

00:18:15.312 --> 00:18:16.633
You like playing with this?

00:18:16.832 --> 00:18:18.512
This is really fun!

00:18:18.584 --> 00:18:19.633
Why didn't you tell me

00:18:19.633 --> 00:18:20.993
when you went out?

00:18:22.032 --> 00:18:23.792
That jet lag

00:18:23.832 --> 00:18:25.713
hit me hard.

00:18:25.832 --> 00:18:27.032
I woke up very early.

00:18:27.072 --> 00:18:29.153
I saw you were sleeping well,
so I didn't wake you.

00:18:30.733 --> 00:18:31.233
This...

00:18:31.233 --> 00:18:31.792
Try this.

00:18:31.993 --> 00:18:32.993
Ms. Li, try it.

00:18:34.913 --> 00:18:36.032
Okay, zoom in.

00:18:36.633 --> 00:18:37.592
Zoom out.

00:18:37.713 --> 00:18:38.352
Zoom out.

00:18:38.473 --> 00:18:39.352
What does that mean?

00:18:41.272 --> 00:18:43.393
Monica, let me take you somewhere else.

00:18:43.713 --> 00:18:44.213
Great!

00:18:44.913 --> 00:18:45.413
This way.

00:18:46.953 --> 00:18:48.233
Something smells.

00:18:48.512 --> 00:18:50.352
What is that? Fragrant and stinky.

00:18:50.752 --> 00:18:51.393
Is there?

00:18:53.153 --> 00:18:54.552
Seems to be coming from over there.

00:18:55.713 --> 00:18:57.272
Probably stinky tofu.

00:18:57.713 --> 00:18:58.953
You might not be used to it.

00:18:59.673 --> 00:19:01.352
No! I wanna try.

00:19:01.752 --> 00:19:03.312
Let's go and check it out!

00:19:03.433 --> 00:19:05.633
Mark! David! Let's go!

00:19:06.193 --> 00:19:07.112
That way.

00:19:07.112 --> 00:19:08.913
Let's go! Buy something to eat.

00:19:09.032 --> 00:19:11.473
I gotta go. Say bye!

00:19:11.792 --> 00:19:13.153
- Goodbye!
- Goodbye!

00:19:13.153 --> 00:19:14.193
- Bye-bye!
- Bye-bye!

00:19:14.233 --> 00:19:14.913
Bye!

00:19:21.112 --> 00:19:22.473
Is this chicken or duck?

00:19:22.873 --> 00:19:24.873
This is chicken.

00:19:28.193 --> 00:19:29.352
Look here.

00:19:29.352 --> 00:19:30.424
(Fruits, Poultry, Meat, Vegetables)

00:19:33.693 --> 00:19:36.512
Okay. I will pay later. Just go.

00:19:36.873 --> 00:19:37.433
Yan!

00:19:37.673 --> 00:19:38.433
Ms. Li.

00:19:38.433 --> 00:19:40.112
We've got four international guests.

00:19:40.393 --> 00:19:42.153
Prepare four bowls of Rouyan.

00:19:42.473 --> 00:19:43.633
Okay. Come in. Have a seat!

00:19:43.713 --> 00:19:44.673
Let's sit over there.

00:19:44.713 --> 00:19:45.213
Okay.

00:19:45.393 --> 00:19:46.233
Go sit over there.

00:19:47.873 --> 00:19:49.393
There is yangqin!

00:19:49.393 --> 00:19:50.193
What's this?

00:19:50.193 --> 00:19:50.913
So cool!

00:19:51.713 --> 00:19:52.213
Play it.

00:19:52.248 --> 00:19:53.072
How do you play it?

00:19:53.072 --> 00:19:53.572
Monica.

00:19:53.913 --> 00:19:55.352
Monkeys!

00:19:55.352 --> 00:19:55.913
The monkey!

00:19:57.352 --> 00:19:59.592
Let's sit here. Sit inside.

00:20:00.112 --> 00:20:00.792
Okay.

00:20:04.352 --> 00:20:05.393
Can I help with anything?

00:20:05.493 --> 00:20:05.993
No need.

00:20:05.993 --> 00:20:07.480
- I'll wash my hands.
- I can handle it.

00:20:07.672 --> 00:20:10.552
(Protect the Environment)

00:20:13.473 --> 00:20:14.233
I'll mix the sauce.

00:20:14.512 --> 00:20:16.153
Okay. Put a bit of each.

00:20:17.552 --> 00:20:18.052
Four bowls.

00:20:18.713 --> 00:20:20.512
I'll mix to my favorite taste.

00:20:20.953 --> 00:20:21.453
Okay.

00:20:41.112 --> 00:20:42.072
Let's go.

00:20:44.112 --> 00:20:44.832
Monica!

00:20:53.240 --> 00:20:55.647
Arguing.

00:21:04.312 --> 00:21:05.752
You block the whole road!

00:21:06.592 --> 00:21:08.352
Why are your sheep here?

00:21:08.832 --> 00:21:10.072
My sheep need exercise too.

00:21:12.024 --> 00:21:13.528
I'll go once they finish unloading.

00:21:14.352 --> 00:21:16.592
Move aside! Let my sheep pass first!

00:21:27.193 --> 00:21:28.752
You're completely blocking the road.

00:21:29.072 --> 00:21:30.713
Fine. I'll leave once they unload.

00:21:31.032 --> 00:21:32.913
I'll go when it's clear.
I can't move now.

00:21:34.233 --> 00:21:34.733
Well...

00:21:38.233 --> 00:21:39.320
- Monica.
- Yeah?

00:21:39.713 --> 00:21:40.512
What about Ms. Li?

00:21:41.393 --> 00:21:43.153
It's okay. Just don't let her find us.

00:21:43.512 --> 00:21:44.673
She's the leader here.

00:21:44.713 --> 00:21:45.993
I came here to investigate.

00:21:46.552 --> 00:21:47.953
We won't see the real situation

00:21:48.153 --> 00:21:49.512
if she comes with us.

00:21:52.112 --> 00:21:53.112
Careful.

00:22:03.873 --> 00:22:04.993
I'm going.

00:22:06.312 --> 00:22:07.673
Finally time to go home.

00:22:08.433 --> 00:22:09.688
We will never come back here.

00:22:12.312 --> 00:22:13.082
Qiuping.

00:22:14.456 --> 00:22:15.393
Just see me off here.

00:22:16.152 --> 00:22:17.176
(Yuehai Town People's Government)
This time we part.

00:22:17.176 --> 00:22:19.312
(The CPC Yuehai Town Committee)
I don't know when we'll meet again.

00:22:20.552 --> 00:22:21.433
Take care of yourself.

00:22:21.633 --> 00:22:22.272
You too.

00:22:23.913 --> 00:22:24.552
Monica.

00:22:24.673 --> 00:22:26.552
How will you tell your dad about Yuehai?

00:22:27.592 --> 00:22:28.752
I really like Yuehai.

00:22:29.873 --> 00:22:30.473
Truly.

00:22:31.312 --> 00:22:32.673
Then, I'll wait for good news.

00:22:35.713 --> 00:22:37.552
But if it's about investment,

00:22:38.193 --> 00:22:40.873
my dad may not choose here.

00:22:41.913 --> 00:22:43.713
He really cares about cleanliness.

00:22:44.112 --> 00:22:47.153
But the sanitary conditions here...

00:22:47.552 --> 00:22:50.153
We'll improve it for sure.

00:22:50.512 --> 00:22:52.312
It's not just about that.

00:22:53.233 --> 00:22:54.512
I really like Yuehai.

00:22:54.953 --> 00:22:58.633
I love its vitality, freedom,

00:22:58.913 --> 00:23:00.673
and the atmosphere.

00:23:01.153 --> 00:23:03.032
But my dad wants a city

00:23:03.433 --> 00:23:05.993
with real development potential.

00:23:07.072 --> 00:23:10.512
Right now,
Yuehai still feels like a village.

00:23:11.352 --> 00:23:12.272
Do you understand?

00:23:14.032 --> 00:23:14.673
Yes.

00:23:19.112 --> 00:23:21.792
Mark, can you give me the footage?

00:23:25.312 --> 00:23:27.352
Okay, I can make a copy for you.

00:23:28.473 --> 00:23:30.792
No. Please leave it here.

00:23:31.193 --> 00:23:32.352
I don't want it to get out.

00:23:38.233 --> 00:23:39.112
What are you doing?

00:23:39.112 --> 00:23:40.193
Just give it to her.

00:23:41.633 --> 00:23:43.473
This matters more to her.

00:23:51.512 --> 00:23:53.433
Monica, thank you for understanding.

00:23:56.752 --> 00:23:59.393
My dear friend, I wish you all the best.

00:23:59.873 --> 00:24:01.032
All the best. Good luck.

00:24:01.512 --> 00:24:02.193
Bye.

00:24:25.953 --> 00:24:26.473
This way.

00:24:27.233 --> 00:24:28.193
Changyuan, Fatty.

00:24:28.433 --> 00:24:30.272
I might borrow this TV for a few days.

00:24:31.072 --> 00:24:33.193
Don't say that. Just leave it here.

00:24:33.473 --> 00:24:34.673
(Yuehai Town Master Plan)
Consider it a gift.

00:24:34.673 --> 00:24:36.473
No. I'll return it later.

00:24:36.552 --> 00:24:37.193
No need.

00:24:37.233 --> 00:24:38.552
It's secondhand anyway.

00:24:38.552 --> 00:24:39.352
Just keep it.

00:24:39.352 --> 00:24:39.993
Secondhand?

00:24:40.673 --> 00:24:43.312
Then, Changyuan, we'll buy it.

00:24:43.393 --> 00:24:44.633
How can I take your money?

00:24:44.633 --> 00:24:45.993
Take the video recorder back.

00:24:46.193 --> 00:24:47.953
No.

00:24:47.953 --> 00:24:48.752
Stop right there.

00:24:50.552 --> 00:24:52.352
That's the rule. We must pay.

00:24:52.832 --> 00:24:53.552
Name your price.

00:24:53.713 --> 00:24:56.673
Ms. Li, a TV is expensive.

00:24:56.913 --> 00:24:58.512
May be thousands. We can't afford that.

00:24:58.592 --> 00:24:59.272
We can rent it.

00:25:00.633 --> 00:25:01.512
I'll decide on this.

00:25:01.913 --> 00:25:03.393
Alright. 800 yuan.

00:25:03.873 --> 00:25:04.512
Okay?

00:25:05.272 --> 00:25:07.153
That's cheap, but we...

00:25:07.393 --> 00:25:07.913
Mr. Tan.

00:25:07.993 --> 00:25:09.393
I think we do need a TV.

00:25:09.592 --> 00:25:10.832
We can watch the news,

00:25:11.153 --> 00:25:13.233
and enrich our free time.

00:25:14.512 --> 00:25:15.873
Watching the news is important.

00:25:16.473 --> 00:25:17.352
Stay informed matters.

00:25:17.552 --> 00:25:18.584
I'll find a way. Okay?

00:25:18.584 --> 00:25:19.792
Qian, come with me to finance.

00:25:19.913 --> 00:25:21.272
Go to finance? Don't bother.

00:25:21.312 --> 00:25:22.272
- Just keep it.
- 800.

00:25:22.352 --> 00:25:22.993
Okay, 800 yuan.

00:25:22.993 --> 00:25:23.873
Rules are rules.

00:25:24.272 --> 00:25:25.552
Why are you winking at me?

00:25:25.913 --> 00:25:26.752
No, I...

00:25:47.433 --> 00:25:49.153
I'm not doing it on purpose!

00:25:51.224 --> 00:25:51.992
What do you mean?

00:25:51.992 --> 00:25:52.633
You hit me!

00:25:52.633 --> 00:25:53.473
You slug!

00:25:53.913 --> 00:25:55.993
What? You want to hit me?

00:25:57.233 --> 00:25:58.153
What do you mean?

00:26:03.272 --> 00:26:04.592
Oh, stop there!

00:26:06.112 --> 00:26:06.612
Don't go!

00:26:20.873 --> 00:26:21.433
What?

00:26:23.873 --> 00:26:24.512
Can we go in?

00:26:24.552 --> 00:26:25.052
Yes.

00:26:25.393 --> 00:26:26.393
Line up.

00:26:26.832 --> 00:26:27.352
Line up!

00:26:27.752 --> 00:26:28.312
Video time!

00:26:29.352 --> 00:26:30.352
How is it? Is it good?

00:26:30.953 --> 00:26:31.552
What film?

00:26:32.373 --> 00:26:32.873
What's up?

00:26:32.873 --> 00:26:33.592
What film is it?

00:26:33.733 --> 00:26:34.233
Well...

00:26:34.233 --> 00:26:34.913
Why so upset?

00:26:34.913 --> 00:26:36.193
Is it a martial arts film?

00:26:37.312 --> 00:26:38.153
A tragedy?

00:26:38.312 --> 00:26:39.233
- Is it a tragedy?
- A tragedy?

00:26:39.233 --> 00:26:40.032
Come by.

00:26:40.153 --> 00:26:40.832
- Hi!
- A tragedy?

00:26:40.832 --> 00:26:41.332
Ms. Gao!

00:26:41.552 --> 00:26:42.752
It's a tragedy.

00:26:42.852 --> 00:26:43.352
A tragedy.

00:26:43.352 --> 00:26:43.913
A tragedy?

00:26:44.352 --> 00:26:45.913
I didn't bring tissues!

00:26:45.913 --> 00:26:46.873
Be serious.

00:26:46.953 --> 00:26:47.673
It's a tragedy.

00:26:47.673 --> 00:26:48.713
Come on. Hurry up.

00:26:48.713 --> 00:26:49.473
Sunflower seeds!

00:26:49.473 --> 00:26:50.193
Don't waste time.

00:26:50.193 --> 00:26:50.832
Come on.

00:26:50.873 --> 00:26:51.393
Here.

00:26:51.393 --> 00:26:51.893
Fatty, here.

00:26:52.272 --> 00:26:53.873
Come on. Here you are.

00:26:54.072 --> 00:26:55.153
More. Give me more.

00:26:55.153 --> 00:26:56.032
- More?
- More, please.

00:26:56.272 --> 00:26:56.772
Okay.

00:27:01.032 --> 00:27:01.913
What's all this about?

00:27:02.393 --> 00:27:03.272
What are you doing?

00:27:03.832 --> 00:27:05.233
Don't bother me with trivial stuff.

00:27:05.272 --> 00:27:06.272
I have important matters.

00:27:06.512 --> 00:27:07.873
We need to be ready

00:27:07.873 --> 00:27:09.153
for the investment.

00:27:09.233 --> 00:27:09.752
Right?

00:27:09.832 --> 00:27:10.393
Mr. Xie.

00:27:10.752 --> 00:27:11.252
Come here.

00:27:11.953 --> 00:27:12.453
Come here.

00:27:13.433 --> 00:27:14.393
There you are.

00:27:15.128 --> 00:27:16.352
Quick! The video's starting.

00:27:16.352 --> 00:27:17.272
Hurry!

00:27:17.272 --> 00:27:18.272
What a big deal.

00:27:18.352 --> 00:27:19.193
Hurry!

00:27:19.193 --> 00:27:19.832
It's starting.

00:27:19.832 --> 00:27:20.792
Sit here.

00:27:21.233 --> 00:27:22.433
We're watching a tragedy.

00:27:22.592 --> 00:27:23.312
Isn't it a comedy?

00:27:23.433 --> 00:27:24.153
What?

00:27:24.272 --> 00:27:24.772
What?

00:27:24.792 --> 00:27:25.873
No. It's a tragedy.

00:27:26.433 --> 00:27:27.112
Come on.

00:27:27.633 --> 00:27:28.552
Everyone's here.

00:27:28.752 --> 00:27:29.953
What's this about?

00:27:30.713 --> 00:27:31.832
To watch the video.

00:27:32.032 --> 00:27:33.032
Here! Two fish.

00:27:33.112 --> 00:27:33.873
Come on. Fish.

00:27:39.953 --> 00:27:40.752
Come here.

00:27:40.752 --> 00:27:42.792
How about that great thing?
That's so bravo.

00:27:53.673 --> 00:27:55.512
You're so pretty.

00:27:56.072 --> 00:27:57.032
So beautiful.

00:27:57.233 --> 00:27:59.272
Let me cut your hair. Snip, snip, snip!

00:28:00.352 --> 00:28:02.112
Snip, snip, snip!

00:28:02.993 --> 00:28:04.193
Why are there foreigners?

00:28:06.233 --> 00:28:06.832
It's Changyuan.

00:28:07.873 --> 00:28:08.993
I'm on TV!

00:28:09.913 --> 00:28:10.552
I'm in the back.

00:28:11.592 --> 00:28:12.433
Like that man,

00:28:12.433 --> 00:28:13.312
Sammo Hung Kam-Bo.

00:28:18.272 --> 00:28:19.592
Look, that's you.

00:28:20.632 --> 00:28:21.351
Ms. Gao.

00:28:21.873 --> 00:28:22.473
No!

00:28:22.552 --> 00:28:23.713
My hairstyle's terrible.

00:28:23.713 --> 00:28:25.193
You're the female lead!

00:28:25.464 --> 00:28:26.712
- Really?
- Makes sense.

00:28:26.832 --> 00:28:28.112
Always the center of attention.

00:28:28.792 --> 00:28:29.953
Like a peacock.

00:28:30.272 --> 00:28:31.512
I did her hairstyle.

00:28:31.512 --> 00:28:32.913
Yes. She did.

00:28:34.873 --> 00:28:35.633
Need any actors?

00:28:36.112 --> 00:28:37.153
They're killing a chicken.

00:28:37.304 --> 00:28:38.296
Killing a chicken.

00:28:39.312 --> 00:28:40.592
Now, plucking the feathers.

00:28:47.953 --> 00:28:49.072
Why are they fighting?

00:29:00.512 --> 00:29:01.433
Stop it!

00:29:01.713 --> 00:29:02.633
You, stop it!

00:29:02.953 --> 00:29:03.592
Stop!

00:29:04.792 --> 00:29:05.312
It's over.

00:29:06.592 --> 00:29:07.092
Finished?

00:29:07.352 --> 00:29:07.873
Is it over?

00:29:07.873 --> 00:29:08.393
I don't know.

00:29:08.393 --> 00:29:08.893
Is it over?

00:29:09.433 --> 00:29:09.933
Mr. Tan.

00:29:10.832 --> 00:29:11.673
What's that mean?

00:29:12.352 --> 00:29:12.852
Everyone.

00:29:14.673 --> 00:29:16.153
Xie, you know.

00:29:16.552 --> 00:29:18.112
The young people

00:29:18.473 --> 00:29:19.233
in this video

00:29:19.233 --> 00:29:21.473
are Ms. Li's foreign friends.

00:29:22.072 --> 00:29:22.673
Good friends.

00:29:22.993 --> 00:29:24.512
They came specially to Yuehai

00:29:24.512 --> 00:29:26.153
to see if Yuehai

00:29:26.233 --> 00:29:28.112
is suitable for investment.

00:29:29.352 --> 00:29:31.393
But you've all seen it.

00:29:32.112 --> 00:29:33.433
About Yuehai's condition,

00:29:33.433 --> 00:29:35.153
they left without saying a word.

00:29:35.673 --> 00:29:36.393
Calling it off?

00:29:36.512 --> 00:29:37.072
What?

00:29:37.112 --> 00:29:38.112
Why?

00:29:40.153 --> 00:29:41.312
Not investing?

00:29:42.752 --> 00:29:43.433
That won't do!

00:29:44.233 --> 00:29:45.433
They can't back out like that.

00:29:45.473 --> 00:29:46.424
Really.

00:29:46.913 --> 00:29:48.512
What does this mean?

00:29:48.592 --> 00:29:50.032
Withdraw it so casually?

00:29:50.272 --> 00:29:51.693
That's not a small thing.

00:29:51.693 --> 00:29:53.153
- Right.
- Any problem,

00:29:53.153 --> 00:29:54.512
we can negotiate.

00:29:54.512 --> 00:29:55.272
Right.

00:29:55.272 --> 00:29:56.473
Whose friends are they?

00:29:56.473 --> 00:29:57.953
Everyone's waiting.

00:29:58.392 --> 00:29:59.288
We are waiting. Right?

00:29:59.512 --> 00:30:00.512
Ms. Li's friends

00:30:00.752 --> 00:30:02.040
should be...

00:30:02.040 --> 00:30:02.993
Be reasonable, right?

00:30:02.993 --> 00:30:03.953
- Exactly.
- Right.

00:30:04.352 --> 00:30:06.873
She can't toy with Yuehai's people.

00:30:06.873 --> 00:30:08.072
We're all ready.

00:30:08.233 --> 00:30:09.352
- All waiting.
- Right.

00:30:09.352 --> 00:30:10.512
Be reasonable, okay?

00:30:10.512 --> 00:30:11.512
How am I not?

00:30:11.512 --> 00:30:12.752
The day they arrived,

00:30:12.752 --> 00:30:14.312
you littered right in front of them.

00:30:14.792 --> 00:30:15.913
Are you crazy?

00:30:16.012 --> 00:30:17.713
That's not the day.

00:30:17.713 --> 00:30:19.512
You're crazy! All of you!

00:30:19.873 --> 00:30:21.233
Asked you to watch a video,

00:30:21.393 --> 00:30:22.552
and you just eat!

00:30:22.713 --> 00:30:23.713
Why eat these here?

00:30:23.713 --> 00:30:24.832
Never had them before?

00:30:24.993 --> 00:30:27.272
He has a point. Why did you bring them?

00:30:27.272 --> 00:30:28.713
- I...
- It's not a show.

00:30:28.792 --> 00:30:30.272
Why did you give me these?

00:30:30.272 --> 00:30:31.512
You brought them here.

00:30:31.512 --> 00:30:32.792
You! Stop eating the banana.

00:30:32.873 --> 00:30:34.752
Clean up. Put them away.

00:30:34.873 --> 00:30:36.433
You really have no manners.

00:30:36.953 --> 00:30:38.873
I've traveled to so many big cities.

00:30:38.873 --> 00:30:41.312
They all emphasize civility
and sanitation.

00:30:41.312 --> 00:30:42.512
Don't litter!

00:30:43.832 --> 00:30:45.873
You just littered. Look!

00:30:46.032 --> 00:30:47.193
See? Look at you.

00:30:47.393 --> 00:30:48.352
Wasn't that you?

00:30:48.433 --> 00:30:49.233
Stop blaming us.

00:30:49.233 --> 00:30:49.832
Well, I...

00:30:50.233 --> 00:30:52.473
I'm just adapting to the environment.

00:30:52.673 --> 00:30:54.433
If you live in a pile of trash,

00:30:54.552 --> 00:30:56.272
isn't it normal to throw trash around?

00:30:56.272 --> 00:30:57.312
What? Pile of trash?

00:30:57.312 --> 00:30:58.232
What do you mean?

00:30:58.312 --> 00:30:59.312
Pile of trash?

00:30:59.473 --> 00:31:01.752
Fatty, how dare you lecture me?

00:31:01.873 --> 00:31:02.473
So what?

00:31:02.512 --> 00:31:03.393
Aren't you in it too?

00:31:04.393 --> 00:31:05.512
Well... I...

00:31:05.552 --> 00:31:06.433
I was following you!

00:31:06.633 --> 00:31:07.552
I was just with you!

00:31:07.552 --> 00:31:08.233
How can you...

00:31:08.393 --> 00:31:09.193
I'm sorry!

00:31:09.713 --> 00:31:10.673
I apologize. Sorry.

00:31:10.752 --> 00:31:11.633
I apologize again.

00:31:11.633 --> 00:31:12.193
Enough.

00:31:12.873 --> 00:31:14.112
Stop arguing! You...

00:31:15.233 --> 00:31:17.433
I'm not here to assign blame.

00:31:17.993 --> 00:31:19.352
I asked you here

00:31:19.433 --> 00:31:20.792
is not to force confessions.

00:31:21.072 --> 00:31:22.393
It has happened.

00:31:22.673 --> 00:31:24.352
We need to face it and solve it. Right?

00:31:24.993 --> 00:31:26.592
First, Yuehai

00:31:27.032 --> 00:31:29.592
was built by all of us together.

00:31:30.312 --> 00:31:31.473
All of you

00:31:32.352 --> 00:31:34.473
came here to settle down.

00:31:34.552 --> 00:31:36.233
And we have overcome many difficulties

00:31:36.352 --> 00:31:39.032
to get to where we are today.

00:31:40.233 --> 00:31:40.752
Soon,

00:31:40.993 --> 00:31:43.393
your factories
will open one after another.

00:31:43.713 --> 00:31:45.913
Now, Yuehai's sanitation

00:31:46.433 --> 00:31:47.592
may seem like a small issue,

00:31:47.913 --> 00:31:51.233
but it can damage Yuehai's image.

00:31:51.993 --> 00:31:53.233
If the image is damaged,

00:31:53.413 --> 00:31:54.792
clients may not come.

00:31:55.233 --> 00:31:57.552
No clients, no business.

00:31:57.552 --> 00:31:58.713
How will Yuehai develop?

00:31:59.272 --> 00:32:00.473
So I suggest

00:32:00.752 --> 00:32:02.352
that from today,

00:32:02.832 --> 00:32:04.272
let's make some changes.

00:32:04.473 --> 00:32:06.072
For ourselves, and for Yuehai.

00:32:06.233 --> 00:32:07.852
Let's change, okay?

00:32:08.272 --> 00:32:08.772
Okay.

00:32:09.233 --> 00:32:10.552
Listen to me.

00:32:11.312 --> 00:32:13.312
The video is proof.

00:32:14.272 --> 00:32:15.112
No one can deny it.

00:32:15.433 --> 00:32:17.673
It's not just about one person.

00:32:17.953 --> 00:32:18.453
Right.

00:32:18.713 --> 00:32:20.713
It reflects Yuehai's overall spirit.

00:32:20.953 --> 00:32:21.453
Right.

00:32:21.673 --> 00:32:22.873
I've learned something today.

00:32:23.233 --> 00:32:24.272
I'll take a stance.

00:32:24.832 --> 00:32:26.792
I'm a leader.

00:32:27.673 --> 00:32:29.633
And my family member's also here.

00:32:29.832 --> 00:32:30.993
Okay, sit.

00:32:31.873 --> 00:32:32.393
All here.

00:32:32.633 --> 00:32:34.112
I must admit

00:32:34.153 --> 00:32:37.512
we didn't pay enough attention
to sanitation before.

00:32:38.512 --> 00:32:39.592
We must take it seriously.

00:32:39.812 --> 00:32:40.312
Right.

00:32:40.312 --> 00:32:42.473
We must solve this problem together.

00:32:42.592 --> 00:32:43.233
Yeah.

00:32:43.312 --> 00:32:45.673
Let the short-sighted people regret it.

00:32:46.012 --> 00:32:46.512
Okay?

00:32:46.512 --> 00:32:47.752
- Right!
- Okay!

00:32:47.792 --> 00:32:48.592
Right.

00:32:49.552 --> 00:32:51.193
- Ms. Gao, I suggest...
- Yes.

00:32:51.193 --> 00:32:52.653
We will donate money.

00:32:52.772 --> 00:32:53.272
Okay.

00:32:53.272 --> 00:32:55.112
To buy one broom for each household.

00:32:55.673 --> 00:32:56.592
One for each?

00:32:56.592 --> 00:32:57.092
Right.

00:33:00.112 --> 00:33:01.272
Not enough? How about two?

00:33:01.832 --> 00:33:03.953
Well, every household gets one broom?

00:33:03.993 --> 00:33:07.233
So many brooms.
People may think you're a broom spirit.

00:33:08.633 --> 00:33:10.112
Then, I'll be Yuehai's broom spirit.

00:33:10.393 --> 00:33:11.552
And you be a dustpan spirit.

00:33:11.752 --> 00:33:12.953
Why not donate dustpans too?

00:33:13.272 --> 00:33:14.792
Broom spirit and dustpan spirit.

00:33:15.032 --> 00:33:16.072
A perfect match, right?

00:33:16.233 --> 00:33:16.733
A set!

00:33:17.272 --> 00:33:18.713
Well, I-I want to say something.

00:33:18.752 --> 00:33:20.393
I won't claim one.

00:33:20.552 --> 00:33:21.072
I won't.

00:33:21.272 --> 00:33:22.393
I'll pay for it myself.

00:33:22.592 --> 00:33:23.433
I'll pay.

00:33:23.832 --> 00:33:24.512
Want to sponsor?

00:33:24.512 --> 00:33:25.713
- He...
- Excellent!

00:33:25.792 --> 00:33:26.292
He donates.

00:33:26.373 --> 00:33:26.873
Yes.

00:33:26.873 --> 00:33:28.056
- You...
- You donate mops!

00:33:28.056 --> 00:33:29.272
Mops! You donate mops!

00:33:29.592 --> 00:33:30.913
One mop per household!

00:33:30.913 --> 00:33:31.953
- He...
- Okay!

00:33:31.953 --> 00:33:33.112
My brother and I

00:33:33.393 --> 00:33:35.193
will donate the mops together.

00:33:35.193 --> 00:33:35.993
You want to donate?

00:33:36.193 --> 00:33:36.873
Do you?

00:33:37.153 --> 00:33:38.233
I didn't say anything.

00:33:38.713 --> 00:33:39.873
We will donate mops.

00:33:40.752 --> 00:33:41.252
Alright.

00:33:41.433 --> 00:33:42.713
Well, my factory

00:33:42.713 --> 00:33:44.112
is about to open soon.

00:33:44.433 --> 00:33:47.433
I'll take the lead on this.

00:33:47.713 --> 00:33:49.272
I will clean it up.

00:33:49.633 --> 00:33:51.052
You can come supervise, okay?

00:33:51.153 --> 00:33:52.913
- Great!
- Great!

00:33:52.993 --> 00:33:54.512
Then, I'll make a commitment too.

00:33:54.953 --> 00:33:56.832
(Watching Video)
I wanted to donate this TV.

00:33:56.920 --> 00:33:58.008
You insisted on paying.

00:33:58.112 --> 00:33:59.352
I'll take that 800 yuan

00:33:59.393 --> 00:34:02.032
and add some
to buy hundreds of large trash bins.

00:34:02.673 --> 00:34:03.792
How many?

00:34:03.832 --> 00:34:04.473
Make it clear!

00:34:04.473 --> 00:34:05.072
Three hundred!

00:34:05.552 --> 00:34:06.953
Dear residents,

00:34:07.272 --> 00:34:10.793
to further improve Yuehai's
overall sanitation,

00:34:11.112 --> 00:34:12.353
ensure public health,

00:34:12.632 --> 00:34:14.913
and strengthen
socialist spiritual civilization,

00:34:15.160 --> 00:34:16.473
following government directives

00:34:16.473 --> 00:34:19.232
on urban and rural
sanitation management,

00:34:19.433 --> 00:34:21.632
(Pitch in, keep it clean.)
we established the following regulations.

00:34:22.192 --> 00:34:24.393
(No public urination here.)
First, residents must regularly clean

00:34:24.393 --> 00:34:26.753
(Sanitation Management Regulations)
areas in front of and around their homes.

00:34:27.032 --> 00:34:30.632
Littering or public urination
will be fined 5 yuan.

00:34:31.592 --> 00:34:33.032
That's not reasonable.

00:34:33.112 --> 00:34:33.953
Right.

00:34:34.032 --> 00:34:35.512
Who made these rules?

00:34:36.313 --> 00:34:38.672
Who else? The new town mayor.

00:34:39.032 --> 00:34:40.592
A new broom sweeps clean.

00:34:40.672 --> 00:34:41.953
Now she's sweeping here.

00:34:41.993 --> 00:34:44.313
She can't just fine us as she likes!

00:34:44.393 --> 00:34:45.100
- Right!
- Right!

00:34:45.100 --> 00:34:46.793
Not just a fine,
but also a public shaming?

00:34:46.793 --> 00:34:47.313
Yeah.

00:34:47.313 --> 00:34:52.353
(Pitch in, keep it clean.
No public urination here.)

00:34:52.353 --> 00:34:53.313
This is the last batch.

00:34:53.873 --> 00:34:55.433
Finish it, and we can go back to rest.

00:34:55.672 --> 00:34:56.192
Got it.

00:35:01.072 --> 00:35:01.712
Don't move!

00:35:05.672 --> 00:35:06.552
I don't.

00:35:07.592 --> 00:35:09.192
I-Is it

00:35:10.192 --> 00:35:10.873
a robbery?

00:35:11.232 --> 00:35:12.112
What robbery?

00:35:12.433 --> 00:35:14.192
Sir, you violated regulations.

00:35:14.393 --> 00:35:15.833
You can't litter here.

00:35:16.672 --> 00:35:18.993
We always dump here.

00:35:19.393 --> 00:35:21.793
Let me tell you.

00:35:22.152 --> 00:35:23.313
Starting yesterday,

00:35:23.672 --> 00:35:26.032
the town government called everyone
to watch the video.

00:35:26.353 --> 00:35:27.313
It's still playing now.

00:35:27.712 --> 00:35:28.953
This morning,

00:35:29.313 --> 00:35:31.232
new sanitation rules were issued.

00:35:31.953 --> 00:35:32.793
Look.

00:35:33.632 --> 00:35:34.873
The notices are posted.

00:35:34.873 --> 00:35:36.433
I can't read.

00:35:39.712 --> 00:35:40.512
Alright, I...

00:35:41.152 --> 00:35:43.032
The broadcast's been playing nonstop.

00:35:43.353 --> 00:35:44.152
Didn't you hear it?

00:35:44.393 --> 00:35:45.393
Well...

00:35:45.773 --> 00:35:48.152
Alright. Whether you heard it or not,

00:35:48.592 --> 00:35:50.953
you violated the rules.
You must pay the fine.

00:35:51.192 --> 00:35:52.712
Who are you?

00:35:53.592 --> 00:35:55.112
We're from the Yuehai Town government.

00:35:55.712 --> 00:35:57.032
This is our town mayor, Ms. Li.

00:35:58.192 --> 00:35:59.112
Ms. Li.

00:35:59.473 --> 00:35:59.993
Hello.

00:36:00.152 --> 00:36:01.953
I-I won't do that again.

00:36:02.473 --> 00:36:04.112
Please let me off this once.

00:36:04.232 --> 00:36:04.873
No.

00:36:05.313 --> 00:36:07.072
We must enforce the regulations.

00:36:07.473 --> 00:36:07.973
Well...

00:36:08.353 --> 00:36:09.873
Just this once.

00:36:10.232 --> 00:36:11.753
I'm Zheng...

00:36:12.953 --> 00:36:15.913
Zheng Decheng's older brother.

00:36:16.793 --> 00:36:17.632
- What?
- What?

00:36:20.072 --> 00:36:21.232
Forget it.

00:36:24.672 --> 00:36:27.112
Leaders, I didn't bring money.

00:36:27.152 --> 00:36:29.592
Could you come back with me to get it?

00:36:29.793 --> 00:36:31.192
Don't play tricks.

00:36:31.313 --> 00:36:32.232
No. I...

00:36:32.273 --> 00:36:34.753
Look, I really didn't bring it.

00:36:34.833 --> 00:36:36.032
See?

00:36:36.152 --> 00:36:38.793
M-My home's up ahead. Very close.

00:36:38.833 --> 00:36:40.953
Just follow me to get it.

00:36:41.072 --> 00:36:41.572
Alright.

00:36:42.313 --> 00:36:44.232
You walk ahead. We'll follow.

00:36:45.632 --> 00:36:49.353
Got fined for dumping trash.

00:37:02.672 --> 00:37:04.512
Well, Ms. Li.

00:37:05.192 --> 00:37:07.433
How much is the fine?

00:37:08.353 --> 00:37:09.072
Five yuan.

00:37:09.473 --> 00:37:10.273
That much?

00:37:11.632 --> 00:37:14.152
Can't you cut some?

00:37:14.353 --> 00:37:16.232
No. Enforcement must be strict.

00:37:19.592 --> 00:37:20.152
Alright.

00:37:20.592 --> 00:37:21.273
I'll go get it.

00:37:27.592 --> 00:37:28.313
Is this his home?

00:37:29.112 --> 00:37:29.712
You're back.

00:37:43.232 --> 00:37:44.273
Give me five yuan.

00:37:46.833 --> 00:37:47.473
What?

00:37:48.353 --> 00:37:50.112
Go get five yuan.

00:38:13.913 --> 00:38:14.592
What's up, Dad?

00:38:26.953 --> 00:38:28.712
Forget it. You don't need to pay.

00:38:29.192 --> 00:38:32.632
But remember, no more littering.

00:38:35.313 --> 00:38:38.232
Okay, I will.

00:38:38.512 --> 00:38:39.913
Thank you, Ms. Li.

00:38:39.993 --> 00:38:40.953
Thank you so much!

00:38:42.192 --> 00:38:44.552
You are so kind.

00:38:45.112 --> 00:38:45.833
See?

00:38:46.192 --> 00:38:47.672
- Let's go.
- I'm so lucky.

00:38:48.152 --> 00:38:49.592
Always run into good people.

00:38:53.433 --> 00:38:54.953
Give this to Mr. Tan.

00:38:55.473 --> 00:38:57.192
I'll pay the fine for him.

00:38:57.592 --> 00:38:58.712
Didn't you spare the fine?

00:38:58.953 --> 00:38:59.873
It still must be paid.

00:39:00.112 --> 00:39:01.473
Rules are rules.

00:39:01.712 --> 00:39:02.212
Take it.

00:39:04.112 --> 00:39:05.512
Do we keep watching?

00:39:06.032 --> 00:39:08.473
No need. We've already made an example.

00:39:14.152 --> 00:39:15.592
(Pitch in, keep it clean.)
Zheng Desheng.

00:39:16.152 --> 00:39:19.032
(No public urination here.)
Littering. Got fined for five yuan,

00:39:19.512 --> 00:39:22.632
and is publicly criticized as a warning.

00:39:22.993 --> 00:39:27.152
They really fined him?
Five yuan? That's a lot!

00:39:27.232 --> 00:39:27.753
Exactly.

00:39:28.353 --> 00:39:29.753
Who was so unlucky?

00:39:30.072 --> 00:39:31.712
Build a civilized Yuehai.

00:39:31.873 --> 00:39:32.753
Who is it?

00:39:32.833 --> 00:39:34.328
They fined Mr. Zheng's older brother?

00:39:34.993 --> 00:39:37.793
What does it say up there?

00:39:38.072 --> 00:39:39.672
Zheng Desheng,
Secretary's older brother,

00:39:39.672 --> 00:39:40.592
(Zheng Desheng: littering; Fine: 5 yuan)
got fined.

00:39:40.753 --> 00:39:42.712
No urinating or defecating.

00:39:43.273 --> 00:39:45.192
No painting on public building walls.

00:39:45.592 --> 00:39:46.473
Desheng?

00:39:47.592 --> 00:39:49.032
Violators will be fined.

00:39:49.833 --> 00:39:52.793
This new town mayor has no heart.
It's all business with her.

00:39:53.032 --> 00:39:54.232
- Exactly.
- Exactly.

00:39:54.273 --> 00:39:55.393
Don't take it to heart.

00:39:56.072 --> 00:39:57.473
Right.

00:39:57.672 --> 00:39:59.473
Desheng, don't take it to heart.

00:39:59.632 --> 00:40:01.273
Maybe they got the name wrong.

00:40:01.313 --> 00:40:02.192
Exactly.

00:40:02.753 --> 00:40:05.273
Littering. Got fined for five yuan.

00:40:05.273 --> 00:40:06.192
Don't take it to heart.

00:40:06.232 --> 00:40:09.072
And he is publicly criticized
as a warning.

00:40:09.672 --> 00:40:10.993
Stop littering on the ground.

00:40:11.313 --> 00:40:12.112
Five yuan!

00:40:12.592 --> 00:40:13.953
I'll be more careful.

00:40:14.072 --> 00:40:16.152
One, two! Yes!

00:40:16.473 --> 00:40:18.793
One, two! Yes!

00:40:18.913 --> 00:40:23.672
One, two! Yes!

00:40:23.873 --> 00:40:26.032
One, two! Yes!

00:40:26.313 --> 00:40:28.313
One, two! Yes!

00:40:28.712 --> 00:40:29.712
One, two.

00:40:31.512 --> 00:40:33.473
Why stop? Keep pulling!

00:40:34.353 --> 00:40:35.833
Zheng Desheng.

00:40:36.313 --> 00:40:38.993
Littering. Got fined for five-yuan,

00:40:39.512 --> 00:40:42.672
and is publicly criticized as a warning.

00:40:43.833 --> 00:40:46.273
Hope you all start with yourselves.

00:40:46.552 --> 00:40:48.552
Promote civility,
foster new social trends.

00:40:48.833 --> 00:40:52.032
Work together
to build a civilized Yuehai.

00:40:52.592 --> 00:40:55.592
Protecting the environment
is everyone's responsibility.

00:40:56.273 --> 00:40:59.873
Posting or drawing on public buildings
is strictly prohibited.

00:41:06.353 --> 00:41:06.993
Li Qiuping.

00:41:07.552 --> 00:41:09.032
Are you targeting me?

00:41:10.512 --> 00:41:11.393
What's up, Mr. Zheng?

00:41:11.753 --> 00:41:14.072
I'm announcing
the violation of sanitation regulations.

00:41:14.512 --> 00:41:15.224
They're arguing.

00:41:15.473 --> 00:41:16.072
Who?

00:41:16.393 --> 00:41:17.753
Ms. Li and Mr. Zheng.

00:41:18.112 --> 00:41:18.632
Really?

00:41:18.632 --> 00:41:19.753
Do you know who you fined?

00:41:20.192 --> 00:41:21.433
It's my older brother!

00:41:22.152 --> 00:41:24.393
You broadcast it
and put up big-character posters!

00:41:24.893 --> 00:41:26.552
Why not stick it on my face?

00:41:28.273 --> 00:41:29.072
Your older brother?

00:41:30.040 --> 00:41:31.480
You wanted to improve sanitation.

00:41:31.672 --> 00:41:34.092
I had the entire town government
support you. Right?

00:41:34.313 --> 00:41:35.512
Our work was disrupted.

00:41:35.873 --> 00:41:37.632
You've made enough trouble!

00:41:37.873 --> 00:41:39.112
What more do you want?

00:41:39.672 --> 00:41:40.433
Mr. Zheng.

00:41:40.833 --> 00:41:43.512
Just the town government
to mind hygiene is not enough.

00:41:43.953 --> 00:41:45.753
This concerns every resident of Yuehai.

00:41:46.273 --> 00:41:47.993
That's why I established these rules.

00:41:49.873 --> 00:41:51.112
You can make rules.

00:41:51.592 --> 00:41:52.092
Dad.

00:41:52.112 --> 00:41:52.873
Let me help you.

00:41:53.112 --> 00:41:53.612
Go back!

00:41:57.672 --> 00:41:58.273
Wait.

00:41:59.393 --> 00:42:00.032
Open that.

00:42:03.313 --> 00:42:05.913
Standing outside. Not embarrassing?

00:42:06.833 --> 00:42:09.993
Mr. Zheng, we must face this problem.

00:42:10.512 --> 00:42:12.433
Sanitation is crucial
for Yuehai's development.

00:42:12.953 --> 00:42:15.112
Do you know
that because of bad sanitation,

00:42:15.473 --> 00:42:17.273
Monica's family withdrew investment?

00:42:21.753 --> 00:42:23.712
Who knows
if she really intends to invest?

00:42:24.152 --> 00:42:25.313
Maybe she was lying!

00:42:25.672 --> 00:42:26.793
How can you say...

00:42:29.192 --> 00:42:29.873
What's up?

00:42:30.672 --> 00:42:31.552
Mr. Zheng.

00:42:32.393 --> 00:42:34.152
Your argument was broadcast live.

00:42:42.433 --> 00:42:43.672
It's a dual-track.

00:42:53.793 --> 00:42:54.293
