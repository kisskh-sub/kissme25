00:00:01.940 --> 00:00:04.610
(Episode 20)

00:00:08.150 --> 00:00:09.510
That looks heavy. Here, let me take it.

00:00:10.010 --> 00:00:12.050
You'll have to make a lunch box like this
for me someday.

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:14.920
Okay.

00:00:28.870 --> 00:00:29.870
Yes.

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:40.950
(CEO Chae Hwa Young)

00:00:41.080 --> 00:00:45.250
CEO Chae,
my sister and I brought you a lunch box.

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:48.450
- Are you in your office now?
- What?

00:00:48.790 --> 00:00:51.320
His sister? Oh Jang Mi?

00:00:52.490 --> 00:00:55.190
She's coming here now?
No. This can't be happening.

00:00:55.660 --> 00:00:57.160
If the Chairman or Seo Rin sees her...

00:00:59.030 --> 00:01:00.130
Goodness.

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:01.770
Gosh.

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:03.900
- What's wrong?
- This is a disaster.

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:08.440
The twin is on her way here.
No, she might already be here.

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:11.410
The twin?

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:13.210
You mean Oh Jang Mi?

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:14.580
We have to stop her.

00:01:15.110 --> 00:01:17.120
If she runs into Seo Rin or the Chairman,

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:20.820
they'll find out
I stole Seo Rin as a baby.

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:32.330
Hello, sir.

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:36.700
Okay.

00:01:49.180 --> 00:01:51.850
The person you are calling is unavailable.
Please leave a message...

00:01:52.220 --> 00:01:54.790
Darn it. Why do you have to be
on the phone now?

00:01:55.690 --> 00:01:56.690
What should I do?

00:01:57.920 --> 00:02:00.860
- I'll go take care of it.
- Stop her! Stop her right now!

00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:03.800
- Don't let her run into anyone.
- Yes, ma'am.

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:11.170
Right.

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:14.210
Actually, I'm at the Dream Hotel now
to see CEO Chae.

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:17.210
Okay. Just a second.

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:20.750
- You guys go on ahead.
- Will that call take a while? Who is it?

00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:21.950
The lounge bar owner.

00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:23.850
Hey, Jang Mi.

00:02:23.850 --> 00:02:25.580
Come here. It won't take long.

00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:33.760
When you see the CEO Chae,

00:02:34.660 --> 00:02:36.690
casually ask her what she thought
of my live performance.

00:02:37.930 --> 00:02:38.930
Got it?

00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:41.370
Why don't you ask her yourself?

00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:43.640
Let's go.

00:02:47.710 --> 00:02:50.010
All right, yes.

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:54.350
The person you are calling is unavailable.
Please leave a message after the tone.

00:02:54.410 --> 00:02:56.510
Darn it! He's still on the phone.

00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:27.610
- The doors are closing.
- Hold on!

00:03:43.660 --> 00:03:46.000
Is CEO Chae in her office today?

00:03:46.430 --> 00:03:47.430
Yes, Chairman.

00:03:53.640 --> 00:03:54.940
Let's take that one.

00:04:00.610 --> 00:04:02.010
The doors are closing.

00:04:06.380 --> 00:04:08.150
This reminds me of the reopening party.

00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:12.290
I never dreamed I'd be back at this hotel
with you, Jang Mi.

00:04:13.190 --> 00:04:14.960
Are you just trying to rub it in?

00:04:15.290 --> 00:04:17.960
That whole day was
an absolute nightmare for me.

00:04:18.030 --> 00:04:19.960
I probably shouldn't have brought that up.

00:04:20.030 --> 00:04:22.530
What? You're not saying that
just to get a rise out of me?

00:04:22.630 --> 00:04:24.100
Hey, what are you talking about?

00:04:24.370 --> 00:04:26.300
It just feels a little surreal,
that's all.

00:04:27.410 --> 00:04:30.440
Riding this elevator alone
with you, Jang Mi.

00:04:31.010 --> 00:04:32.410
- What?
- But...

00:04:32.740 --> 00:04:36.210
don't get the wrong idea.
I'm just saying, that's all.

00:04:36.280 --> 00:04:39.580
Aren't you the one with a dirty mind,
Lawyer Kang?

00:04:40.450 --> 00:04:42.290
I knew you were a weirdo from the start!

00:04:42.290 --> 00:04:44.220
Gosh, my ears are ringing.

00:04:44.520 --> 00:04:48.930
Right. That day, I saw someone
who looked exactly like you.

00:04:50.600 --> 00:04:51.600
Oh my goodness.

00:04:52.060 --> 00:04:54.770
Why is the brat who broke the guitar here?

00:04:55.670 --> 00:04:59.940
I'm Ma Seo Rin.
I'm the Director of Food and Beverage.

00:05:03.980 --> 00:05:06.310
Her glasses and hair
were a bit different, but...

00:05:06.380 --> 00:05:07.510
Someone who looked exactly like me?

00:05:07.880 --> 00:05:09.050
Yes.

00:05:09.050 --> 00:05:11.820
It wasn't just a resemblance.
She looked exactly like you.

00:05:11.980 --> 00:05:13.080
Like an identical twin.

00:05:17.160 --> 00:05:18.160
Goodness.

00:05:18.520 --> 00:05:19.820
What? Why are you laughing?

00:05:20.590 --> 00:05:21.590
Please.

00:05:22.290 --> 00:05:26.230
I get that a lot.
People say I look like some celebrity.

00:05:26.860 --> 00:05:30.000
If you think I'm pretty, just say so.

00:05:30.370 --> 00:05:32.500
Why beat around the bush
with your flirting?

00:05:33.140 --> 00:05:36.010
I see through your act, Lawyer Kang.

00:05:36.010 --> 00:05:37.440
- All right?
- Goodness.

00:05:37.480 --> 00:05:39.080
Gosh, I can't believe you.

00:05:42.910 --> 00:05:45.980
Yes, I understand.
I'll be sure to tell CEO Chae.

00:05:46.250 --> 00:05:48.150
Okay, then. Thank you.

00:05:51.060 --> 00:05:52.060
Oh my goodness.

00:05:52.260 --> 00:05:53.730
Where is Ms. Oh Jang Mi?

00:05:54.730 --> 00:05:55.860
My sister?

00:05:56.430 --> 00:05:59.130
Isn't she at the office yet?
She went up ahead of me.

00:06:11.040 --> 00:06:14.480
Perfect timing. Get in.
I was just on my way to see Seo Rin.

00:06:16.550 --> 00:06:17.780
Father, just a moment.

00:06:19.350 --> 00:06:20.920
- Hello?
- CEO Chae,

00:06:20.920 --> 00:06:22.220
have you met with Oh Jang Mi?

00:06:22.390 --> 00:06:25.960
- I think she's already at your office.
- What? To my office?

00:06:38.700 --> 00:06:39.800
The doors are opening.

00:06:43.710 --> 00:06:44.710
CEO Chae.

00:06:56.990 --> 00:06:57.990
Hey...

00:06:59.490 --> 00:07:01.090
We just missed her.

00:07:02.930 --> 00:07:06.160
What do we do about the lunch box?
It looks like CEO Chae is busy.

00:07:14.970 --> 00:07:18.580
Get Oh Jang Mi into my office
without anyone seeing her.

00:07:19.040 --> 00:07:20.750
Don't just have her hanging around
in the hallway.

00:07:31.590 --> 00:07:34.330
Chairman, it seems my guests
have arrived at my office.

00:07:34.630 --> 00:07:35.630
Oh, really?

00:07:35.990 --> 00:07:38.760
Secretary Kim,
please take the Chairman to see Seo Rin.

00:07:41.300 --> 00:07:44.040
I'm so sorry you came all this way.
I have a meeting to get to.

00:07:44.340 --> 00:07:46.370
Work comes first. Go take care of it.

00:07:51.680 --> 00:07:52.980
The doors are closing.

00:07:59.480 --> 00:08:00.480
Goodness.

00:08:01.320 --> 00:08:04.420
So this is CEO Chae's office.

00:08:05.060 --> 00:08:08.330
But is it okay
for us to just come in like this?

00:08:09.130 --> 00:08:12.100
Please have a seat.
She will be here shortly.

00:08:12.900 --> 00:08:14.330
- Okay.
- Okay.

00:08:16.570 --> 00:08:18.040
Welcome.

00:08:18.870 --> 00:08:20.970
- Have a seat.
- Okay.

00:08:21.110 --> 00:08:22.110
Yes.

00:08:28.150 --> 00:08:29.210
This is insane.

00:08:29.780 --> 00:08:33.250
I know they're twins, but how can she
and Seo Rin look so identical?

00:08:33.820 --> 00:08:35.020
It gives me the creeps.

00:08:36.950 --> 00:08:39.220
So, what brings you two here today?

00:08:39.360 --> 00:08:42.530
Jang Mi wanted to thank you in person.

00:08:42.790 --> 00:08:45.600
It's been my brother's lifelong dream
to be a singer.

00:08:45.830 --> 00:08:49.030
Thank you so much
for making his dream possible.

00:08:50.740 --> 00:08:52.100
Please, don't thank me.

00:08:52.100 --> 00:08:54.110
I was just doing what needed to be done.

00:08:54.910 --> 00:08:57.940
You see, I live my life
looking after our neighbors in need...

00:08:58.310 --> 00:09:01.050
and helping those
who require my assistance.

00:09:01.380 --> 00:09:03.580
I find great fulfillment in my life
by doing so.

00:09:04.150 --> 00:09:08.320
I've always lived my life that way,
and I always will.

00:09:09.090 --> 00:09:11.390
In fact, that's the motto
of our Dream Hotel as well.

00:09:11.720 --> 00:09:13.320
That's truly admirable.

00:09:15.230 --> 00:09:17.300
You're Professor Kang's son, correct?

00:09:18.530 --> 00:09:19.830
And you said your name was Oh Jang Mi?

00:09:20.730 --> 00:09:22.500
How are you here together?

00:09:22.730 --> 00:09:25.170
The other day,
Jang Mi brought a lunch box,

00:09:25.170 --> 00:09:26.270
but wasn't allowed in.

00:09:26.670 --> 00:09:27.870
She was stopped by the security guards.

00:09:28.410 --> 00:09:30.110
That's why I came with her today.

00:09:31.180 --> 00:09:32.210
A lunch box?

00:09:32.510 --> 00:09:35.410
I'm here to deliver this
to CEO Chae Hwa Young.

00:09:35.510 --> 00:09:37.180
I'm sorry, but this is a restricted area.

00:09:37.680 --> 00:09:39.320
I'll make sure she gets it,
so you can just give it to me.

00:09:39.380 --> 00:09:40.820
Well...

00:09:41.150 --> 00:09:45.190
Please tell her it's a thank-you gift
from the singer, Tae Pyung.

00:09:45.190 --> 00:09:46.660
Please tell her that.

00:09:46.860 --> 00:09:48.930
Wait. Here, take this.

00:09:49.290 --> 00:09:52.760
Please give this
to CEO Chae Hwa Young too.

00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:55.170
- I will.
- Okay, thank you.

00:10:02.170 --> 00:10:04.010
Gosh, she looks exactly like Director Ma.

00:10:06.010 --> 00:10:09.650
CEO Chae. Someone just dropped this off
for you.

00:10:11.880 --> 00:10:14.020
- A lunch box?
- Yes, she just left.

00:10:16.820 --> 00:10:19.460
You can have it. I have an appointment,
so I have to go.

00:10:21.630 --> 00:10:23.460
Oh, is that what happened?

00:10:23.460 --> 00:10:27.600
You forgot to take the side dishes
the last time you visited.

00:10:27.930 --> 00:10:30.700
I came to bring you the side dishes,
and as a small token of our gratitude,

00:10:30.970 --> 00:10:33.000
my mom and I packed a lunch box for you.

00:10:33.740 --> 00:10:34.910
Please, try it.

00:10:35.410 --> 00:10:37.270
Did your mother cook?

00:10:37.380 --> 00:10:41.080
Of course. My mom makes half
of all the side dishes we serve.

00:10:42.510 --> 00:10:44.780
I thought your mother was sick.

00:10:45.680 --> 00:10:49.220
You saw my mom at the shop, didn't you?

00:10:50.090 --> 00:10:51.620
You're right. She is sick.

00:10:53.620 --> 00:10:56.560
It's because of an accident
she had a long time ago.

00:10:57.330 --> 00:11:01.930
But it seems she can still do things
she's done over and over for years.

00:11:02.130 --> 00:11:05.440
For example, skills like riding a bike
or cooking don't fade away.

00:11:05.640 --> 00:11:07.940
That's because they're ingrained
in the subconscious.

00:11:09.740 --> 00:11:13.240
- Manager Lee, you may leave.
- Yes.

00:11:19.150 --> 00:11:22.720
What? The Chairman went to get
Seo Rin himself?

00:11:22.990 --> 00:11:24.160
I can't believe this.

00:11:24.560 --> 00:11:26.460
Some precious bloodline she is.

00:11:26.460 --> 00:11:27.630
Tell me about it.

00:11:28.660 --> 00:11:31.960
Mom, what if Ma Seo Rin fights us
to the very end?

00:11:32.460 --> 00:11:35.070
The way the Chairman acts,
I don't think we can win against her.

00:11:35.270 --> 00:11:39.300
Don't worry. The Chairman was the one
who invited us to live here.

00:11:39.570 --> 00:11:42.370
No matter how important bloodlines are,
he wouldn't just kick us out, would he?

00:11:42.770 --> 00:11:43.870
He has his reputation to think about.

00:11:44.140 --> 00:11:47.310
But still, Mom.
I'm so anxious. You have to do something.

00:11:48.510 --> 00:11:51.080
You've worked so hard for decades
trying to win over the Chairman,

00:11:51.720 --> 00:11:53.720
and now this happens
when we're so close to the finish line?

00:11:53.780 --> 00:11:56.650
That hunched-over old man
must be incredibly lonely.

00:11:56.890 --> 00:11:59.820
You just trust me and focus on your work.

00:12:01.030 --> 00:12:02.060
All right.

00:12:05.760 --> 00:12:08.730
Ma Seo Rin is the problem.
It's always her.

00:12:09.430 --> 00:12:11.440
Grandpa!

00:12:11.900 --> 00:12:13.500
I told you I didn't want to go.

00:12:13.500 --> 00:12:15.570
Good grief, you reek of alcohol.

00:12:15.870 --> 00:12:18.240
How much did you drink all night?

00:12:19.780 --> 00:12:22.410
Actually, I threw a wild party yesterday.

00:12:23.210 --> 00:12:26.520
In any case, you're coming home today.
All right?

00:12:27.120 --> 00:12:29.390
You know I can't manage without you.

00:12:30.020 --> 00:12:31.060
I know.

00:12:31.820 --> 00:12:34.290
But I'll have to think about it.

00:12:34.360 --> 00:12:35.430
For goodness' sake.

00:12:35.430 --> 00:12:37.090
What's there to think about?

00:12:37.560 --> 00:12:41.070
I'll be expecting you home today.
All right?

00:12:41.870 --> 00:12:42.870
You rascal...

00:12:44.640 --> 00:12:45.640
Let's go.

00:12:59.150 --> 00:13:02.720
Since we're here, let's go see CEO Chae.

00:13:02.720 --> 00:13:03.820
Yes, sir.

00:13:05.990 --> 00:13:08.360
Her meeting with her guests
should be about over by now.

00:13:11.400 --> 00:13:14.030
(Dream Hotel,
Unlocking New Dreams)

00:13:14.030 --> 00:13:15.870
(Redesigning the Experience)

00:13:21.570 --> 00:13:23.740
Your dream is to be a chef, Ms. Oh?

00:13:24.110 --> 00:13:25.110
Yes.

00:13:25.410 --> 00:13:28.480
I was here for the reopening party,
working as part of the event staff.

00:13:28.810 --> 00:13:30.780
That was the first time I saw you,

00:13:31.280 --> 00:13:34.650
and I thought,
"How can anyone be that beautiful?"

00:13:35.050 --> 00:13:36.250
I was truly in awe.

00:13:37.560 --> 00:13:38.760
You were here before?

00:13:38.860 --> 00:13:42.430
Actually, she wanted to apply for a job
here at Chang Restaurant.

00:13:42.890 --> 00:13:45.200
And if there happens to be an opening
right now...

00:13:45.260 --> 00:13:46.400
Oh, dear. What to do?

00:13:46.700 --> 00:13:48.730
I have an appointment,
so I really should be going.

00:13:49.070 --> 00:13:50.870
I'll be sure to enjoy this. Thank you.

00:13:51.270 --> 00:13:53.000
Yes, of course.

00:13:53.300 --> 00:13:56.040
I apologize.
We've taken up too much of your time.

00:13:56.570 --> 00:13:58.080
- Then...
- Thanks.

00:14:02.710 --> 00:14:03.750
Sir.

00:14:03.950 --> 00:14:05.120
Yes.

00:14:05.120 --> 00:14:06.520
Is CEO Chae in there?

00:14:07.450 --> 00:14:08.450
Sir...

00:14:09.750 --> 00:14:10.750
I'm sorry.

00:14:11.020 --> 00:14:12.020
Just a moment.

00:14:12.020 --> 00:14:13.820
- She's still in a meeting, sir.
- Yes?

00:14:13.820 --> 00:14:15.630
Hang on, just wait a moment.

00:14:17.530 --> 00:14:21.200
It sounds like the Chairman is here.
We can see ourselves out.

00:14:21.270 --> 00:14:24.500
- I'm sorry again for taking up your time.
- Oh, no, not at all.

00:14:24.940 --> 00:14:28.410
I really appreciate you
bringing this thoughtful lunch box.

00:14:28.970 --> 00:14:29.970
But from now on,

00:14:30.510 --> 00:14:32.240
you don't have to come here like this.

00:14:32.980 --> 00:14:34.880
- I'm sorry?
- There are a lot of eyes on me,

00:14:35.350 --> 00:14:37.350
so I'd appreciate it
if you didn't visit me like this.

00:14:38.020 --> 00:14:39.580
Please don't take this the wrong way.

00:14:39.920 --> 00:14:42.950
Yes, I understand.

00:14:55.930 --> 00:14:58.340
- Hello...
- Tae Pyung!

00:14:59.000 --> 00:15:00.100
Hello, CEO Chae.

00:15:00.770 --> 00:15:02.970
I heard you sent a flower basket
for my debut.

00:15:03.240 --> 00:15:04.940
I was already so grateful that you came.

00:15:04.940 --> 00:15:06.210
But a flower basket too?

00:15:06.310 --> 00:15:09.310
The owner of the lounge bar
insisted I give you his thanks.

00:15:10.110 --> 00:15:13.380
Right. Well, I have a meeting
I need to get to.

00:15:14.150 --> 00:15:16.890
Right. Please enjoy the lunch box.

00:15:21.160 --> 00:15:23.730
The Chairman said you seemed busy,
so he left.

00:15:24.230 --> 00:15:28.070
- I just saw him out.
- Okay. See them out for me, will you?

00:15:28.330 --> 00:15:29.330
- Yes.
- Thank you.

00:15:30.600 --> 00:15:32.400
Escort them out discreetly.

00:15:43.210 --> 00:15:44.650
What nuisances.

00:15:52.790 --> 00:15:56.060
So is it all officially over
with that guy?

00:15:56.430 --> 00:15:58.960
We split up on the condition
that I get custody of Bo Ra.

00:15:59.230 --> 00:16:00.600
And did you get any alimony?

00:16:01.430 --> 00:16:04.870
He's drowning in debt.
He didn't have a cent to his name.

00:16:05.700 --> 00:16:07.140
Some woman must have cleaned him out.

00:16:07.640 --> 00:16:10.810
- So what are you going to do now?
- I don't know, Dad.

00:16:11.440 --> 00:16:13.240
I have to raise Bo Ra,
but I just don't know how.

00:16:14.910 --> 00:16:15.950
Oh, dear.

00:16:17.280 --> 00:16:19.120
This is all my fault.

00:16:20.250 --> 00:16:22.450
I never should have
let you marry that punk.

00:16:22.790 --> 00:16:25.060
I should have done everything to stop you.

00:16:25.060 --> 00:16:27.860
I'm the one who insisted
on eloping with him.

00:16:28.090 --> 00:16:30.060
But thinking about it now,

00:16:30.460 --> 00:16:33.130
the way you were
so head over heels for him...

00:16:34.230 --> 00:16:38.070
is all because I raised you alone
without a mother.

00:16:39.540 --> 00:16:41.570
I think you were just
starved for affection.

00:16:43.610 --> 00:16:45.010
I'm so sorry, Tae Sook.

00:16:45.640 --> 00:16:48.510
Dragging you around in my truck
when you were little,

00:16:49.450 --> 00:16:51.750
I couldn't even give you
a proper education.

00:16:52.980 --> 00:16:55.690
You were just a little girl, but you
cooked meals with your tiny hands...

00:16:56.250 --> 00:16:58.620
and took care of a sick Suk Hee.

00:16:59.420 --> 00:17:01.490
It must've been difficult
and exhausting for you.

00:17:01.830 --> 00:17:02.890
Dad.

00:17:03.260 --> 00:17:05.060
Don't think like that.

00:17:05.060 --> 00:17:07.060
It's all my fault.

00:17:07.300 --> 00:17:10.100
No, Dad. It was my fault.

00:17:13.070 --> 00:17:14.810
Don't cry, Dad.

00:17:25.880 --> 00:17:27.520
Where did Mom go?

00:17:31.090 --> 00:17:32.160
What's this? A lunch box?

00:17:37.560 --> 00:17:38.800
Looks delicious.

00:17:42.770 --> 00:17:44.270
Should I have a taste?

00:17:49.570 --> 00:17:50.840
This is incredible.

00:17:51.680 --> 00:17:52.740
What's this?

00:18:08.690 --> 00:18:09.760
Mrs. Yang.

00:18:13.200 --> 00:18:14.330
Mrs. Yang!

00:18:17.840 --> 00:18:19.070
Were you calling for me?

00:18:20.700 --> 00:18:23.610
Who else would I be calling?
It's just you and me here.

00:18:24.070 --> 00:18:26.010
Can't you come faster when I call?

00:18:26.080 --> 00:18:28.180
Just tell me what you want.

00:18:28.680 --> 00:18:32.520
The nerve.
Where do you get off being so insolent?

00:18:32.580 --> 00:18:35.090
Look who's talking.

00:18:35.820 --> 00:18:38.520
The newcomer wants my spot? That's rich.

00:18:38.520 --> 00:18:39.660
Oh, my.

00:18:40.090 --> 00:18:42.230
Are you talking to me?

00:18:42.530 --> 00:18:44.560
That's right. I'm talking to you.

00:18:45.030 --> 00:18:49.070
Gosh. You've got some nerve. How dare you?

00:18:49.470 --> 00:18:52.640
- Do you have any idea who I am?
- I do.

00:18:53.070 --> 00:18:56.440
- You're trying to trap the Chairman.
- What did you say?

00:18:56.740 --> 00:18:58.840
What is wrong with you?

00:18:59.540 --> 00:19:01.950
Just because it's true
doesn't mean you can say it!

00:19:02.610 --> 00:19:04.750
You've gotten too comfortable here.

00:19:04.950 --> 00:19:07.220
I'll have you fired, just you wait.

00:19:07.320 --> 00:19:10.220
Go ahead and try if you think you can.

00:19:10.590 --> 00:19:13.520
The Chairman won't eat anything
unless I cook it.

00:19:14.290 --> 00:19:15.290
What?

00:19:19.100 --> 00:19:21.000
I was wondering why she was so confident.

00:19:21.000 --> 00:19:22.270
That's what it was?

00:19:24.970 --> 00:19:27.040
For dinner tonight,

00:19:27.040 --> 00:19:28.810
make the Chairman's favorite
spicy croaker stew.

00:19:29.170 --> 00:19:31.110
That's an order from the future lady
of this house.

00:19:31.410 --> 00:19:32.510
In her dreams.

00:19:32.780 --> 00:19:35.080
I'm the one who decides
what's for dinner tonight.

00:19:35.780 --> 00:19:37.610
The nerve of her,
when she's on borrowed time.

00:19:38.020 --> 00:19:40.920
It's obvious CEO Chae will have her
kicked out of this house any day now.

00:19:45.320 --> 00:19:48.090
Why didn't you go with Grandpa?
What are you doing here?

00:19:48.730 --> 00:19:52.300
I'm so full. Mom, where did you get this?

00:19:52.600 --> 00:19:53.800
This is incredible.

00:19:55.430 --> 00:19:58.970
- So what did the Chairman say?
- That Yeom San Wol and Jin Hong Ju...

00:19:59.300 --> 00:20:02.640
got kicked out of their studio
and have nowhere else to go.

00:20:02.810 --> 00:20:04.540
So he's letting them stay with him
for a little while.

00:20:05.040 --> 00:20:06.940
So he said not to get the wrong idea
and to come back home.

00:20:07.780 --> 00:20:10.780
Why? He should've just bought them
their own apartment.

00:20:12.380 --> 00:20:14.320
Mom, do they deliver from this place?

00:20:14.890 --> 00:20:15.890
Ma Seo Rin.

00:20:16.850 --> 00:20:18.490
Don't you feel the least bit threatened?

00:20:18.620 --> 00:20:21.760
Jin Hong Ju was just made a team leader,
and you're just going to let this happen?

00:20:21.760 --> 00:20:23.560
That sly fox is using her mother...

00:20:23.630 --> 00:20:27.030
to get who-knows-what else
from your grandfather.

00:20:27.330 --> 00:20:29.630
Please, get a grip.

00:20:30.500 --> 00:20:34.140
Don't worry, Mom. You saw what happened.

00:20:34.240 --> 00:20:35.770
The second I didn't come home,

00:20:35.770 --> 00:20:38.340
Grandfather came to me,
trying to smooth things over.

00:20:39.440 --> 00:20:40.940
I'll just wait and see
what Jin Hong Ju pulls.

00:20:42.080 --> 00:20:43.480
And then I'll make her pay.

00:20:46.480 --> 00:20:47.990
(Professor Kang)

00:20:48.150 --> 00:20:49.520
Why aren't you answering that, Mom?

00:20:50.150 --> 00:20:51.360
It's not important.

00:21:05.740 --> 00:21:08.510
Have you eaten lunch?
The weather is lovely.

00:21:09.070 --> 00:21:11.510
How about that outdoor date
we never got to have?

00:21:12.180 --> 00:21:13.910
Are you free tonight?

00:21:15.580 --> 00:21:16.710
I want to see you.

00:21:17.080 --> 00:21:18.080
What are you doing?

00:21:18.980 --> 00:21:20.020
You startled me!

00:21:20.580 --> 00:21:23.390
Why are you so jumpy?

00:21:24.790 --> 00:21:27.620
I really need to get you
some herbal supplements.

00:21:28.730 --> 00:21:31.630
I meant to buy you some,
but I've been too busy to order it.

00:21:32.260 --> 00:21:35.070
I'll get some herbal medicine
for you soon. It won't be long.

00:21:35.130 --> 00:21:36.800
That will put the energy back
in your step.

00:21:38.370 --> 00:21:40.970
Don't spend your money. I'm fine, really.

00:21:43.710 --> 00:21:47.110
Goodness. He's just putting on a show
when he wants some.

00:21:57.220 --> 00:22:00.160
Even if they find out it was you,
nothing will change.

00:22:00.960 --> 00:22:02.090
Actually,

00:22:03.060 --> 00:22:05.460
this might make it even easier
to buy her off.

00:22:06.630 --> 00:22:07.660
Buy her off?

00:22:08.270 --> 00:22:09.400
What if we did this?

00:22:10.770 --> 00:22:11.940
You think...

00:22:12.440 --> 00:22:15.370
we should send Oh Jang Mi abroad
on the Dream Scholarship Foundation?

00:22:15.610 --> 00:22:18.180
If we send her abroad discreetly,

00:22:19.480 --> 00:22:21.810
we won't have to get our hands dirty.

00:22:22.750 --> 00:22:25.980
Yes, Chairman Ma only has a few years
left at most.

00:22:26.480 --> 00:22:29.020
We can remove her with the same program
Hong Ju was on.

00:22:29.190 --> 00:22:30.520
I did some digging, and Oh Jang Mi...

00:22:30.850 --> 00:22:33.660
apparently gave up her study abroad dream
because of financial issues.

00:22:33.760 --> 00:22:34.790
Perfect.

00:22:35.360 --> 00:22:37.030
Let's dangle the bait soon.

00:23:00.250 --> 00:23:01.280
Ha Neul.

00:23:02.750 --> 00:23:04.050
Where are you?

00:23:05.020 --> 00:23:06.120
My son.

00:23:28.110 --> 00:23:29.110
Oh, right.

00:23:38.590 --> 00:23:39.620
You're still here?

00:23:39.920 --> 00:23:41.020
I will leave soon.

00:23:41.830 --> 00:23:43.890
I've finished organizing
the restaurant's reservations.

00:23:44.060 --> 00:23:46.700
Okay. It's late, so head on home.

00:23:47.060 --> 00:23:48.770
You should go too.

00:23:49.130 --> 00:23:51.500
You can't keep working this late
every single night.

00:23:52.440 --> 00:23:53.670
Don't worry about me.

00:23:54.810 --> 00:23:57.640
Oh Jang Mi said she was
at our hotel's reopening event.

00:23:58.140 --> 00:24:00.040
And I had absolutely no idea.

00:24:01.280 --> 00:24:03.710
What in the world have you been doing
this whole time?

00:24:05.220 --> 00:24:06.220
My apologies.

00:24:06.980 --> 00:24:08.350
And what about taking down the banner?

00:24:08.850 --> 00:24:11.660
Have you handled it properly, right?
There are no issues, right?

00:24:12.360 --> 00:24:13.660
Yes, that went smoothly.

00:24:13.990 --> 00:24:18.330
Go take care of Oh Jang Mi's study abroad
arrangements tomorrow.

00:24:18.730 --> 00:24:19.730
Got it?

00:24:20.560 --> 00:24:22.000
Yes, understood.

00:24:47.460 --> 00:24:50.130
I checked,
and the dashcam footage is there.

00:24:50.130 --> 00:24:51.330
I'll send it over.

00:24:52.430 --> 00:24:53.500
Thank you.

00:24:57.530 --> 00:24:59.740
(Lawyer Kang Baek Ho)

00:25:02.210 --> 00:25:03.770
Wait a minute. Isn't that...

00:25:08.280 --> 00:25:09.280
Jang Mi.

00:25:10.450 --> 00:25:12.980
I got the dashcam footage of the person
who took down the banner.

00:25:13.320 --> 00:25:15.020
Really? Let me see.

00:25:20.320 --> 00:25:21.490
This is the guy right here.

00:25:28.030 --> 00:25:32.070
(Suk Hee's Side Dishes)

00:26:14.240 --> 00:26:15.950
(The First Man)

00:26:16.010 --> 00:26:18.880
CEO Chae would like to have a word
with you.

00:26:19.420 --> 00:26:20.550
Oh no!

00:26:20.620 --> 00:26:22.050
Go to the restroom and clean up, quickly!

00:26:22.050 --> 00:26:23.820
Unbelievable. Why won't this unlock?

00:26:24.150 --> 00:26:25.160
Studying abroad?

00:26:25.220 --> 00:26:26.660
How could someone be so generous?

00:26:26.660 --> 00:26:28.760
They're sending you to study abroad?

00:26:28.930 --> 00:26:31.530
Mom, will you be okay if I study abroad?

00:26:31.860 --> 00:26:33.330
Here are the documents you need
to study abroad.

00:26:34.300 --> 00:26:36.730
Mom, what's wrong? Mom, snap out of it.

00:26:36.830 --> 00:26:37.870
Come on, snap out of it!

00:26:38.400 --> 00:26:40.100
Jung Suk Hee recognized you?

00:26:44.940 --> 00:26:46.740
