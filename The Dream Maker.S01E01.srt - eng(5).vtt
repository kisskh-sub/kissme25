(My hometown became prosperous
by refusing to accept poverty.)

00:01:45.952 --> 00:01:47.512
(Seawater intruded year-round.)

00:01:47.551 --> 00:01:48.471
(The soil was barren.)

00:01:49.232 --> 00:01:50.352
(Poverty drove people)

00:01:50.432 --> 00:01:51.911
(to travel far, seeking livelihoods.)

00:01:52.952 --> 00:01:54.191
(By the early 1980s,)

00:01:54.551 --> 00:01:55.911
(Pingchuan County People's Government)
(with the Reform and Opening-up,)

00:01:56.088 --> 00:01:56.962
(the introduction of)

00:01:56.962 --> 00:01:58.191
(Stay Committed to Development)
(household responsibility system)

00:01:58.391 --> 00:01:59.911
(Build Pingchuan Together)
(and the rise of TVEs)

00:02:00.271 --> 00:02:02.872
(significantly
increased the people's wealth.)

00:02:03.712 --> 00:02:07.031
(Self-employed individuals'
return boosted prosperity,)

00:02:07.191 --> 00:02:08.551
(nourishing this land in return.)

00:02:09.192 --> 00:02:13.632
(From then on, the people here
embraced the chance for a better life.)

00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:16.088
(Firm Confidence, High Morale)

00:02:16.391 --> 00:02:19.391
(On this day, the county
had a three-level cadre conference.)

00:02:19.792 --> 00:02:22.952
(Secretary Zhao asked us to decorate
the County Committee Compound.)

00:02:23.352 --> 00:02:26.040
(The County Committee Canteen's
food had never been better.)

00:02:26.671 --> 00:02:29.632
(This would become a pivotal meeting
in Pingchuan County's history.)

00:02:30.352 --> 00:02:33.591
(A major announcement
would be made today.)

00:02:37.991 --> 00:02:39.232
Sir, it's so lively here.

00:02:40.551 --> 00:02:41.512
Truly excellent.

00:02:41.512 --> 00:02:43.151
The food today is especially good.

00:02:43.151 --> 00:02:44.952
I just saw many delicious dishes.

00:02:45.271 --> 00:02:45.991
Two portions left.

00:02:46.271 --> 00:02:46.671
Really?

00:02:46.671 --> 00:02:47.632
I heard the government

00:02:47.632 --> 00:02:48.792
(Canteen)
puts a lot into city building.

00:02:49.431 --> 00:02:50.512
It's over ten million yuan.

00:02:50.512 --> 00:02:51.551
No small amount at all.

00:02:51.912 --> 00:02:52.512
It's a grant

00:02:52.512 --> 00:02:53.391
of over ten million.

00:02:53.391 --> 00:02:54.711
Gaining both fame and profit.

00:02:54.711 --> 00:02:56.151
That's ten million.

00:02:56.151 --> 00:02:57.391
This is massive funding.

00:02:57.591 --> 00:02:58.671
The county can't afford it.

00:02:59.111 --> 00:03:00.391
I heard it's over ten million.

00:03:00.391 --> 00:03:01.391
Over ten million?

00:03:02.752 --> 00:03:03.831
Where are the rumors from?

00:03:03.912 --> 00:03:04.991
They've spread rapidly.

00:03:06.792 --> 00:03:07.352
Have no idea.

00:03:07.871 --> 00:03:08.792
How can they afford it?

00:03:09.072 --> 00:03:10.431
Exactly. How could it be?

00:03:10.431 --> 00:03:11.391
Over ten million.

00:03:16.032 --> 00:03:18.551
We must stop these inaccurate rumors
from spreading further.

00:03:18.952 --> 00:03:20.632
Or it'll be hard for you to proceed.

00:03:20.991 --> 00:03:22.391
So, Guan, please notify everyone.

00:03:22.871 --> 00:03:23.952
Start the meeting earlier.

00:03:24.431 --> 00:03:25.512
Let's make it noon then.

00:03:26.032 --> 00:03:27.671
Get some food if you haven't eaten.

00:03:28.312 --> 00:03:29.632
We can talk over food.

00:03:29.792 --> 00:03:30.111
Sure.

00:03:30.200 --> 00:03:33.080
(Pingchuan County
Three-Level Cadre Conference)

00:03:37.944 --> 00:03:41.080
(Zhao Dongsheng)

00:03:41.792 --> 00:03:43.512
Do you know
why the food is so good today?

00:03:44.032 --> 00:03:46.431
Because I want you all
to remember this day.

00:03:48.232 --> 00:03:48.871
But it seems

00:03:48.871 --> 00:03:52.151
some matters
are more captivating than good food.

00:03:53.232 --> 00:03:54.271
I need to clarify.

00:03:55.591 --> 00:03:58.232
Some rumors you've heard are true.

00:03:59.072 --> 00:04:00.032
But others aren't.

00:04:01.072 --> 00:04:02.232
(Xia Changyou, Guan Yiming)
The secretary is speaking.

00:04:02.232 --> 00:04:02.912
Stop eating.

00:04:04.551 --> 00:04:05.591
But he said we could.

00:04:05.752 --> 00:04:10.551
I am here to announce the accurate news.

00:04:11.551 --> 00:04:12.671
In 1984,

00:04:12.752 --> 00:04:15.792
No. 1 Central Document
gave us significant inspiration.

00:04:16.151 --> 00:04:19.992
We will indeed build Yuehai City.

00:04:20.512 --> 00:04:22.151
See? They said so earlier.

00:04:28.072 --> 00:04:28.992
It's from the top.

00:04:29.192 --> 00:04:29.711
It'll happen.

00:04:29.711 --> 00:04:30.992
I knew they'd build a city.

00:04:32.351 --> 00:04:33.231
Everyone,

00:04:33.312 --> 00:04:34.151
be quiet.

00:04:37.231 --> 00:04:38.791
I'm going to say a few words

00:04:38.992 --> 00:04:39.672
while you eat.

00:04:40.432 --> 00:04:40.992
Everyone,

00:04:41.831 --> 00:04:44.432
Yuehai is Pingchuan's crucial hub.

00:04:45.192 --> 00:04:46.952
Developing it properly

00:04:47.872 --> 00:04:51.312
will revitalize all of Pingchuan.

00:04:52.711 --> 00:04:58.711
Our people have been
craving stable economic opportunities.

00:05:02.791 --> 00:05:04.192
The Yuehai project is urgent.

00:05:04.711 --> 00:05:06.231
We want to build Yuehai City.

00:05:06.711 --> 00:05:07.391
It's good.

00:05:07.992 --> 00:05:08.632
And hard too.

00:05:09.432 --> 00:05:11.591
Our county's finances
are extremely tight.

00:05:12.312 --> 00:05:14.632
We barely have funds to invest.

00:05:15.031 --> 00:05:16.151
No money?

00:05:18.312 --> 00:05:19.271
No?

00:05:22.831 --> 00:05:24.552
But I heard it's over ten million?

00:05:24.752 --> 00:05:25.752
Without funds...

00:05:26.112 --> 00:05:27.192
how can we build a city?

00:05:27.591 --> 00:05:28.512
A hot ticket?

00:05:28.632 --> 00:05:30.151
Turns out it's a hot potato.

00:05:30.271 --> 00:05:30.872
Exactly.

00:05:31.112 --> 00:05:32.591
- It won't work.
- It's impossible.

00:05:33.271 --> 00:05:33.992
Therefore,

00:05:36.072 --> 00:05:37.312
I've been pondering:

00:05:38.591 --> 00:05:39.791
Times make heroes.

00:05:40.271 --> 00:05:43.791
Who can shoulder this responsibility?

00:05:45.231 --> 00:05:46.192
The person I envision

00:05:47.151 --> 00:05:49.831
must be a trailblazer
who never gives up.

00:05:51.351 --> 00:05:52.632
They need courage and vision.

00:05:53.711 --> 00:05:54.591
That's me.

00:05:56.312 --> 00:05:57.512
They must be resourceful,

00:05:57.872 --> 00:05:58.831
shoulder responsibility,

00:05:59.952 --> 00:06:01.031
and withstand pressure.

00:06:01.992 --> 00:06:03.031
That's Zheng Decheng.

00:06:03.072 --> 00:06:04.192
Zheng Decheng fits.

00:06:04.632 --> 00:06:05.512
Right, Zheng Decheng.

00:06:05.591 --> 00:06:07.992
Guan, explain the details to everyone.

00:06:13.351 --> 00:06:14.031
Everyone,

00:06:14.791 --> 00:06:16.911
the County Standing Committee
has decided

00:06:17.432 --> 00:06:21.271
that this time, we won't use
the traditional appointment method.

00:06:22.312 --> 00:06:24.512
Instead, we encourage
voluntary applications.

00:06:25.192 --> 00:06:26.312
Voluntary applications?

00:06:28.351 --> 00:06:29.192
Voluntary?

00:06:29.192 --> 00:06:30.791
Zhang has the application forms.

00:06:30.911 --> 00:06:31.432
Zhang,

00:06:32.072 --> 00:06:32.831
distribute them.

00:06:34.632 --> 00:06:35.271
We'll see.

00:06:35.872 --> 00:06:37.271
Xia, are you going?

00:06:43.471 --> 00:06:43.911
Sorry.

00:06:43.911 --> 00:06:44.632
It's fine.

00:06:45.072 --> 00:06:46.031
M-Mr. Zhao.

00:06:46.791 --> 00:06:48.351
It's urgent. I have to interrupt.

00:06:48.632 --> 00:06:49.351
I need someone.

00:06:49.872 --> 00:06:51.791
Which one is Zheng Decheng?

00:06:53.072 --> 00:06:53.992
Zheng Decheng?

00:06:55.831 --> 00:06:56.231
Me.

00:06:56.591 --> 00:06:57.112
What is it?

00:06:57.351 --> 00:06:58.992
Your son had an incident at school.

00:06:59.351 --> 00:07:00.591
The call came through to us.

00:07:01.351 --> 00:07:01.952
Hurry and go.

00:07:05.031 --> 00:07:06.752
Sorry, could you clear the bowls for me?

00:07:06.791 --> 00:07:07.312
Sir,

00:07:08.192 --> 00:07:09.791
he is Zheng Decheng.

00:07:09.911 --> 00:07:11.992
The District Party Secretary
of Jiangku District.

00:07:13.351 --> 00:07:14.312
Qiuping.

00:07:15.711 --> 00:07:16.632
Qiuping.

00:07:17.072 --> 00:07:18.072
Li Qiuping.

00:07:20.312 --> 00:07:21.112
Li Qiuping.

00:07:22.471 --> 00:07:23.432
Bravo! Bravo!

00:07:23.432 --> 00:07:24.591
Li Qiuping.

00:07:24.872 --> 00:07:26.231
Bravo!

00:07:27.432 --> 00:07:29.672
Stop the drumming. Stop.

00:07:30.112 --> 00:07:31.072
Li Qiuping.

00:07:31.672 --> 00:07:32.632
Qiuping.

00:07:46.312 --> 00:07:47.151
Put it down quickly.

00:07:47.271 --> 00:07:48.112
Put it down.

00:07:48.872 --> 00:07:49.872
Your chance is here.

00:07:51.432 --> 00:07:52.151
Look at you.

00:07:52.151 --> 00:07:53.391
The meeting's almost over.

00:07:53.791 --> 00:07:55.112
A lion dancer had diarrhea.

00:07:55.552 --> 00:07:56.911
I just filled in for them.

00:07:57.151 --> 00:07:58.831
Didn't expect the meeting
to start early.

00:07:59.231 --> 00:08:01.432
As a secretary
of the County Committee Office,

00:08:01.512 --> 00:08:02.351
you know everything.

00:08:02.552 --> 00:08:02.872
Liu,

00:08:03.231 --> 00:08:04.192
what did they say?

00:08:05.192 --> 00:08:06.552
About the Secretary of Yuehai.

00:08:06.952 --> 00:08:07.831
They said

00:08:08.231 --> 00:08:10.632
all section-chief-level and higher
cadres can volunteer.

00:08:11.711 --> 00:08:12.911
Everyone, think about it.

00:08:14.112 --> 00:08:16.432
Those interested
must submit the form on time.

00:08:16.791 --> 00:08:17.591
No extensions.

00:08:18.471 --> 00:08:18.992
That's all.

00:08:24.992 --> 00:08:26.231
I've helped prepare this.

00:08:26.552 --> 00:08:28.552
But no one told me I could volunteer.

00:08:28.711 --> 00:08:30.351
They've given the application forms.

00:08:30.711 --> 00:08:31.552
Why would I lie?

00:08:31.872 --> 00:08:32.672
Voluntary?

00:08:32.991 --> 00:08:34.552
Section-chief-level and higher cadres?

00:08:34.672 --> 00:08:35.392
Of course.

00:08:35.991 --> 00:08:36.591
Are you sure?

00:08:36.672 --> 00:08:37.272
Yes.

00:08:37.312 --> 00:08:38.111
Just go.

00:08:44.032 --> 00:08:44.471
Zhang.

00:08:44.831 --> 00:08:45.351
Qiuping?

00:08:45.392 --> 00:08:45.871
Zhang.

00:08:46.111 --> 00:08:46.711
Sorry.

00:08:47.111 --> 00:08:48.231
I missed the meeting.

00:08:48.751 --> 00:08:50.392
Do you still have any application forms?

00:08:50.631 --> 00:08:51.231
Qiuping,

00:08:51.312 --> 00:08:52.471
you came too late.

00:08:52.792 --> 00:08:54.192
No application forms are left.

00:08:54.871 --> 00:08:55.591
I have to go.

00:08:55.711 --> 00:08:56.351
Bye.

00:09:01.304 --> 00:09:03.262
(Pingchuan County
Three-Level Cadre Conference)

00:09:28.991 --> 00:09:29.351
Speak.

00:09:29.912 --> 00:09:30.956
Where are the books from?

00:09:31.751 --> 00:09:32.152
Uncle's.

00:09:32.152 --> 00:09:32.952
He didn't want them.

00:09:33.032 --> 00:09:34.312
My classmates like them too.

00:09:34.471 --> 00:09:35.192
So I...

00:09:35.312 --> 00:09:36.871
So you rent them out, is that it?

00:09:37.952 --> 00:09:38.312
Yes.

00:09:40.032 --> 00:09:40.711
'Yes'?

00:09:41.111 --> 00:09:43.152
You rent books
and think you're justified?

00:09:44.032 --> 00:09:46.231
Well, the school never said
we can't rent them.

00:09:46.231 --> 00:09:47.152
I did nothing wrong.

00:09:48.631 --> 00:09:49.952
By making money off classmates?

00:09:52.111 --> 00:09:53.231
I deal with you at home.

00:09:53.952 --> 00:09:54.471
Dad.

00:10:04.072 --> 00:10:04.631
Liu.

00:10:05.952 --> 00:10:06.672
You're back.

00:10:08.072 --> 00:10:08.871
And the form?

00:10:09.231 --> 00:10:10.192
Already submitted it.

00:10:10.991 --> 00:10:11.912
Thanks for today.

00:10:12.432 --> 00:10:13.111
Without you,

00:10:13.272 --> 00:10:14.591
I would've missed the deadline.

00:10:15.272 --> 00:10:17.711
You keep droning on about Yuehai
in my ear every day,

00:10:17.831 --> 00:10:18.792
like a million times.

00:10:19.072 --> 00:10:20.672
What kind of friend would I be

00:10:20.991 --> 00:10:21.912
if I didn't tell you?

00:10:22.351 --> 00:10:24.272
But I'm still nervous.

00:10:24.672 --> 00:10:26.351
You're Class of 1977.

00:10:26.831 --> 00:10:28.751
The only college graduate in our county.

00:10:29.032 --> 00:10:30.272
I'm not worried at all.

00:10:30.672 --> 00:10:31.272
You know what?

00:10:31.711 --> 00:10:33.231
What I'm actually worried about now...

00:10:36.591 --> 00:10:37.272
is your family.

00:10:41.511 --> 00:10:42.272
Will it work?

00:10:44.952 --> 00:10:45.471
It'll work.

00:11:00.440 --> 00:11:04.984
(Harmony in the family

00:11:38.912 --> 00:11:40.800

to the provincial capital?)

00:11:41.072 --> 00:11:41.871
(Do you know?)

00:12:03.831 --> 00:12:04.751
(No idea.)

00:12:19.351 --> 00:12:20.751
(Tao's already graduated.)

00:12:21.032 --> 00:12:21.912
(She should go.)

00:12:22.631 --> 00:12:24.751
(You don't get a say in this.)

00:13:11.751 --> 00:13:12.871
I've got an announcement.

00:13:13.511 --> 00:13:15.152
I'm running for Secretary of Yuehai.

00:13:16.312 --> 00:13:17.711
I've filled out the application.

00:13:18.831 --> 00:13:19.912
Any objections?

00:13:21.952 --> 00:13:22.591
None?

00:13:23.511 --> 00:13:24.631
Then I'm going to bed.

00:13:25.231 --> 00:13:25.711
Wait.

00:13:28.792 --> 00:13:29.432
I disagree.

00:13:34.231 --> 00:13:34.912
I disagree too.

00:13:37.272 --> 00:13:39.511
Can't you talk properly to our daughter?

00:13:40.471 --> 00:13:42.032
She went behind our backs.

00:13:42.511 --> 00:13:43.991
Why are you blaming me?

00:13:44.272 --> 00:13:45.471
I merely signed up.

00:13:45.952 --> 00:13:47.432
I'm not even sure I'll get elected.

00:13:47.631 --> 00:13:48.432
Exactly.

00:13:48.912 --> 00:13:50.792
The outcome isn't certain yet.

00:13:51.871 --> 00:13:52.871
So, Qiuping,

00:13:53.231 --> 00:13:55.552
don't take this election too seriously.

00:13:56.312 --> 00:13:59.231
You really should consider
going to the provincial capital.

00:13:59.631 --> 00:13:59.991
Dad,

00:14:00.231 --> 00:14:01.672
I want to do this right now.

00:14:02.032 --> 00:14:02.792
As for the rest,

00:14:03.152 --> 00:14:04.312
I haven't planned that far.

00:14:15.032 --> 00:14:15.672
Mr. Zheng.

00:14:17.471 --> 00:14:18.111
Mr. Zheng.

00:14:21.351 --> 00:14:22.072
Is your dad home?

00:14:22.312 --> 00:14:22.792
He's inside.

00:14:23.751 --> 00:14:24.272
Mr. Zheng.

00:14:25.192 --> 00:14:25.591
Heavens.

00:14:25.912 --> 00:14:27.072
I finally found you.

00:14:28.552 --> 00:14:29.711
What's wrong? Why the rush?

00:14:30.312 --> 00:14:31.351
Come with me quickly.

00:14:31.392 --> 00:14:31.912
Big trouble.

00:14:31.912 --> 00:14:32.511
Where to?

00:14:32.672 --> 00:14:33.912
Just come. I'll tell you.

00:14:33.912 --> 00:14:34.952
No, I'm busy here.

00:14:34.952 --> 00:14:35.912
We'll talk on the road.

00:14:37.152 --> 00:14:37.912
Alright.

Ms. Zheng is here.

Ms. Zheng.

Ms. Zheng is here.

Ms. Zheng is here.

He's here.

Ms. Zheng is here.

00:14:51.111 --> 00:14:52.032
Ms. Zheng is here.

00:14:52.392 --> 00:14:53.432
Ms. Zheng is here.

- Mr. Zheng.
- Mr. Zheng knows.

00:14:55.072 --> 00:14:55.912
- Let's go.
- Go.

00:14:57.016 --> 00:15:03.325
(In One's Prime)

00:15:27.552 --> 00:15:28.111
Alright.

00:15:28.591 --> 00:15:29.511
Since she's applied,

00:15:29.711 --> 00:15:31.432
let's wait for the results first.

00:15:31.591 --> 00:15:32.871
Can't you have some principles?

00:15:33.471 --> 00:15:35.991
My principle
is respecting Qiuping's choice.

00:15:35.991 --> 00:15:37.912
She should be in the provincial capital.

00:15:38.032 --> 00:15:39.351
She should marry Du Tao.

00:15:39.591 --> 00:15:40.511
Do you understand?

00:15:40.672 --> 00:15:41.751
Do you not want her to go?

00:15:41.751 --> 00:15:42.792
I don't want her to go?

00:15:43.511 --> 00:15:45.152
Hadn't you made that scene years ago,

00:15:45.351 --> 00:15:47.792
she would've stayed there
right after graduation.

00:15:48.072 --> 00:15:48.792
Li Dafu,

00:15:49.272 --> 00:15:50.231
have you no shame?

00:15:50.672 --> 00:15:51.591
Was I making a scene?

00:15:51.952 --> 00:15:53.312
If you hadn't cheated on me,

00:15:53.392 --> 00:15:54.432
would I have drunk poison?

00:15:54.591 --> 00:15:55.392
Listen to me.

00:15:55.631 --> 00:15:56.591
I will never allow

00:15:56.711 --> 00:15:58.072
Qiuping to set foot in that dump.

00:15:58.272 --> 00:15:59.152
Look at you.

00:15:59.511 --> 00:16:00.792
Always too controlling.

00:16:01.432 --> 00:16:02.552
Anyone would leave you.

00:16:36.312 --> 00:16:37.072
Qiuping?

00:16:37.231 --> 00:16:38.272
Why are you here so late?

00:16:38.471 --> 00:16:39.672
I'm back for some work.

00:16:40.072 --> 00:16:41.392
I'd like to use the meeting room.

00:16:42.152 --> 00:16:42.552
Okay.

00:16:43.471 --> 00:16:43.871
Here.

00:16:44.032 --> 00:16:45.032
I'll head off first.

00:16:48.511 --> 00:16:49.032
Zhang.

00:16:49.991 --> 00:16:51.312
How many applied this time?

00:16:53.511 --> 00:16:54.231
Nineteen.

00:16:55.152 --> 00:16:56.152
Got it. Thanks.

00:16:56.272 --> 00:16:56.751
No problem.

00:17:02.751 --> 00:17:03.432
Miss,

00:17:03.792 --> 00:17:05.031
I must submit my application.

00:17:06.471 --> 00:17:08.112
This is...

00:17:09.672 --> 00:17:11.071
This is your application form?

00:17:11.632 --> 00:17:12.031
Yes.

00:17:12.271 --> 00:17:14.511
Actually, I intended
to submit it this afternoon.

00:17:14.791 --> 00:17:15.632
But I didn't make it.

00:17:16.031 --> 00:17:17.271
I've been swamped.

00:17:17.511 --> 00:17:19.311
And I couldn't find my original form.

00:17:19.551 --> 00:17:20.991
So I had to make do with this.

00:17:21.231 --> 00:17:21.952
Sorry about that.

00:17:22.832 --> 00:17:23.672
Sorry.

00:17:23.872 --> 00:17:25.791
The application deadline has passed.

00:17:26.551 --> 00:17:28.192
Mr. Zhao said punctuality is a must.

00:17:30.392 --> 00:17:30.952
Wait,

00:17:31.071 --> 00:17:31.991
what do you mean?

00:17:32.672 --> 00:17:33.791
I've already explained.

00:17:33.872 --> 00:17:34.711
I didn't mean this.

00:17:35.231 --> 00:17:36.352
I was just too busy.

00:17:36.352 --> 00:17:37.632
So I was delayed a bit.

00:17:38.952 --> 00:17:39.551
Just take it.

00:17:39.872 --> 00:17:40.432
- Okay?
- Sir.

00:17:40.632 --> 00:17:41.991
You weren't just a little late.

00:17:42.311 --> 00:17:43.991
You were hours late.

00:17:44.991 --> 00:17:48.231
Why are you being
such a stickler for the rules?

00:17:49.231 --> 00:17:51.551
Do you have any idea
what this application means?

00:17:51.991 --> 00:17:52.551
Do you know

00:17:52.632 --> 00:17:55.832
the impact of refusing this form
could be enormous for the future?

00:17:56.152 --> 00:17:57.271
Do you even know who I am?

00:17:58.352 --> 00:17:58.952
You are...

00:17:59.551 --> 00:18:00.231
Whoever you are,

00:18:00.231 --> 00:18:01.872
you still have to follow the rules.

00:18:02.832 --> 00:18:03.872
Zheng Decheng, right?

00:18:04.271 --> 00:18:04.751
Yes.

00:18:05.231 --> 00:18:08.791
The election for the Secretary of Yuehai
is a major county event.

00:18:08.991 --> 00:18:12.912
It's a key initiative for Pingchuan's
development in the coming decades.

00:18:13.511 --> 00:18:15.672
All cadres volunteering
to work in Yuehai

00:18:16.071 --> 00:18:17.672
submitted their applications on time.

00:18:18.271 --> 00:18:18.872
But you?

00:18:19.592 --> 00:18:21.071
You missed the deadline.

00:18:21.432 --> 00:18:23.192
And you presented this as a substitute.

00:18:23.551 --> 00:18:25.551
Is this your attitude and sincerity?

00:18:25.791 --> 00:18:26.872
Who says I'm not sincere?

00:18:27.952 --> 00:18:29.511
What's wrong with my attitude?

00:18:30.471 --> 00:18:32.592
I planned to submit it much earlier.

00:18:33.031 --> 00:18:33.912
But I had no choice.

00:18:33.912 --> 00:18:35.192
I've been swamped.

00:18:35.471 --> 00:18:37.152
Do you know what I was just handling?

00:18:37.632 --> 00:18:38.991
I was dealing with a huge matter.

00:18:38.991 --> 00:18:39.952
It's Yuehai's future...

00:18:40.952 --> 00:18:42.112
I won't argue with you.

00:18:45.071 --> 00:18:46.471
I'm leaving the form here.

00:18:46.751 --> 00:18:49.551
I'd like to see if the leadership
will accept my application.

00:18:52.311 --> 00:18:52.991
And you,

00:18:53.352 --> 00:18:54.152
what's your name?

00:18:54.471 --> 00:18:55.152
What's your role?

00:18:55.392 --> 00:18:56.071
Your supervisor?

00:18:56.352 --> 00:18:56.991
Who taught you?

00:18:57.352 --> 00:18:59.392
I'm Li Qiuping,
a secretary of the county committee.

00:18:59.392 --> 00:19:01.311
I don't need you telling me
how to do my job.

00:19:07.991 --> 00:19:08.432
Fine.

00:19:09.031 --> 00:19:09.751
You win.

00:19:10.152 --> 00:19:11.551
It's not worth arguing.

00:19:12.152 --> 00:19:13.672
But mark my words today.

00:19:14.392 --> 00:19:17.352
All the other applicants
are just here to make up the numbers.

00:19:19.231 --> 00:19:20.311
Don't run away.

00:19:23.231 --> 00:19:24.112
Zheng Decheng,

00:19:25.392 --> 00:19:27.192
even if you are remarkable,

00:19:27.791 --> 00:19:29.832
you still need
to submit a proper application form.

00:19:30.311 --> 00:19:31.231
Amidst rules,

00:19:31.551 --> 00:19:33.551
there's no room
for your individual heroics.

00:19:34.471 --> 00:19:36.432
Take this cigarette pack back.

00:19:43.632 --> 00:19:44.271
Miss Li,

00:19:45.551 --> 00:19:46.551
listen carefully.

00:19:47.551 --> 00:19:48.392
To build Yuehai City,

00:19:49.592 --> 00:19:50.632
if the nation funds it,

00:19:51.271 --> 00:19:54.112
any Party member could be its secretary.

00:19:55.152 --> 00:19:56.271
If they don't fund it,

00:19:56.991 --> 00:20:00.271
then only I, Zheng Decheng,
can be that secretary.

00:20:08.592 --> 00:20:09.551
Lunatic.

00:20:10.192 --> 00:20:10.872
Exactly.

00:20:48.791 --> 00:20:49.471
Leaders,

00:20:49.791 --> 00:20:54.872
these are all the candidates who applied
to run for Secretary of Yuehai.

00:20:55.192 --> 00:20:58.872
Today, we need to select
the final few candidates from them.

00:21:01.311 --> 00:21:03.511
The situation is more optimistic
than I expected.

00:21:03.952 --> 00:21:04.751
I've checked.

00:21:04.751 --> 00:21:06.672
Nineteen have applied.

00:21:06.912 --> 00:21:08.031
It should be twenty.

00:21:09.791 --> 00:21:12.592
Zheng Decheng
applied too late yesterday.

00:21:14.511 --> 00:21:14.952
Guan,

00:21:15.152 --> 00:21:16.632
how could we take a cigarette pack?

00:21:17.031 --> 00:21:17.872
It's inappropriate.

00:21:18.352 --> 00:21:19.031
Zheng Decheng

00:21:19.071 --> 00:21:20.071
is far too flippant.

00:21:20.392 --> 00:21:21.471
Li helped take it.

00:21:21.991 --> 00:21:24.632
She said Zheng Decheng
lost the application form yesterday.

00:21:25.152 --> 00:21:26.231
That still won't do.

00:21:26.592 --> 00:21:27.311
Look, Guan,

00:21:27.471 --> 00:21:30.152
you can't favor Zheng Decheng because

00:21:30.511 --> 00:21:31.231
he worked for you.

00:21:32.672 --> 00:21:33.872
It's fine. In a special time,

00:21:34.031 --> 00:21:35.432
if it's not a matter of principle,

00:21:35.751 --> 00:21:36.352
don't sweat it.

00:21:36.632 --> 00:21:37.231
Come on.

00:21:37.872 --> 00:21:39.511
Let's discuss the 20 applicants.

00:21:40.088 --> 00:21:42.432
(Pingchuan County People's Government
Pingchuan County Committee)

00:21:42.432 --> 00:21:45.231
(That day, the meeting went on
from afternoon late into the night.)

00:21:47.152 --> 00:21:50.672
(The leadership was especially cautious
about the candidates.)

00:21:52.112 --> 00:21:54.471
(Yuehai's development
is vital to the county's progress.)

00:21:55.551 --> 00:21:59.152
(Allowing cadres to volunteer
was an unprecedented initiative.)

00:22:00.672 --> 00:22:03.392
(Everyone was waiting for the outcome.)

00:22:18.071 --> 00:22:18.392
Okay.

00:22:20.112 --> 00:22:20.791
Mr. Zhao.

00:22:21.672 --> 00:22:22.296
Magistrate Xia.

00:22:30.031 --> 00:22:30.551
Well,

00:22:31.912 --> 00:22:32.751
leaders,

00:22:33.231 --> 00:22:34.952
I know this is highly irregular,

00:22:35.551 --> 00:22:36.991
but I still have to ask,

00:22:38.071 --> 00:22:42.031
is my name on the list of candidates
for the election or not?

00:22:42.751 --> 00:22:44.192
Then why do you even ask?

00:22:45.152 --> 00:22:46.071
I'm not telling you.

00:22:52.632 --> 00:22:55.085
(Conference Room)

00:23:32.352 --> 00:23:33.031
Director Cai.

00:23:33.352 --> 00:23:34.071
Thanks.

00:23:40.031 --> 00:23:40.511
Thanks.

00:23:41.392 --> 00:23:41.991
You're welcome.

00:23:48.192 --> 00:23:48.751
See?

00:23:49.352 --> 00:23:50.031
I got chosen.

00:23:50.751 --> 00:23:52.311
A cigarette pack got me here.

00:24:09.912 --> 00:24:10.471
You're here.

00:24:11.071 --> 00:24:12.432
- Minister Guan.
- Mr. Cai, come here.

00:24:12.632 --> 00:24:12.912
Okay.

00:24:12.912 --> 00:24:13.952
- Mr. Guan.
- Sit.

00:24:14.832 --> 00:24:15.231
Come on.

00:24:15.511 --> 00:24:16.952
I'll keep it brief.

00:24:17.031 --> 00:24:17.791
Just sit down.

00:24:19.791 --> 00:24:21.031
I'll be brief.

00:24:21.392 --> 00:24:24.392
After serious and careful deliberation,
the Standing Committee has decided

00:24:24.672 --> 00:24:27.311
that you three will be the candidates
for Secretary of Yuehai.

00:24:29.511 --> 00:24:30.231
However,

00:24:30.471 --> 00:24:31.711
there will be a speech segment.

00:24:32.352 --> 00:24:33.352
After the speeches,

00:24:33.832 --> 00:24:35.392
we will make the final decision.

00:24:38.471 --> 00:24:38.991
Miss Li,

00:24:39.872 --> 00:24:40.912
you're truly formidable.

00:24:41.832 --> 00:24:42.432
Thank you!

00:24:43.592 --> 00:24:44.192
Decheng,

00:24:44.192 --> 00:24:45.551
your reputation precedes you.

00:24:47.471 --> 00:24:48.192
What reputation?

00:24:50.432 --> 00:24:51.071
A good one.

00:24:53.751 --> 00:24:54.751
You all, take note.

00:24:54.952 --> 00:24:57.352
The time is Monday at 2 PM.

00:24:57.832 --> 00:24:59.256
At the county committee auditorium.

00:24:59.872 --> 00:25:02.311
Each of you
must deliver a campaign speech.

00:25:04.071 --> 00:25:04.511
Okay.

00:25:05.192 --> 00:25:05.711
Mr. Guan,

00:25:05.791 --> 00:25:07.632
may I ask if there's an outline?

00:25:08.432 --> 00:25:08.912
No.

00:25:10.311 --> 00:25:11.791
I don't know what they will ask.

00:25:12.511 --> 00:25:13.271
But I think

00:25:13.551 --> 00:25:15.751
you'll need to elaborate
on building Yuehai City.

00:25:16.672 --> 00:25:17.672
And make it detailed.

00:25:18.192 --> 00:25:18.952
Go get prepared.

00:25:19.231 --> 00:25:19.952
- Okay.
- Okay.

00:25:19.952 --> 00:25:20.344
Alright.

00:25:20.471 --> 00:25:21.632
I need to go. See you.

00:25:22.271 --> 00:25:23.551
Do I even need to prepare?

00:25:23.952 --> 00:25:25.551
This stuff is already in my head.

00:25:25.551 --> 00:25:26.231
All of it.

00:25:28.912 --> 00:25:29.991
Prepare well.

00:25:30.592 --> 00:25:31.031
You.

00:25:32.471 --> 00:25:33.311
Mr. Guan, take care.

00:25:33.471 --> 00:25:33.912
Okay.

00:25:34.071 --> 00:25:35.152
Decheng, you...

00:25:35.872 --> 00:25:36.632
you're something.

00:25:40.832 --> 00:25:41.672
Li.

00:25:44.031 --> 00:25:45.152
So that's it.

00:25:46.352 --> 00:25:47.071
What do you mean?

00:25:47.432 --> 00:25:49.231
You refused to take my application form

00:25:49.432 --> 00:25:51.192
and gave all those righteous lectures.

00:25:52.152 --> 00:25:54.632
It's because you also applied, right?

00:26:00.112 --> 00:26:00.672
It's okay.

00:26:01.152 --> 00:26:02.471
No need to explain. I get it.

00:26:02.672 --> 00:26:03.551
I can understand.

00:26:04.152 --> 00:26:05.511
No one dares compete with me.

00:26:05.832 --> 00:26:06.872
After all, I

00:26:06.991 --> 00:26:07.632
- do...
- Little man.

00:26:09.511 --> 00:26:10.791
Wha... what 'men'?

00:26:11.352 --> 00:26:12.592
Li... Litter men?

00:26:13.231 --> 00:26:13.991
What's that mean?

00:26:15.711 --> 00:26:16.432
Foreign language?

00:26:17.912 --> 00:26:19.551
Think knowing it makes you special?

00:26:23.872 --> 00:26:25.031
Will your parents be okay

00:26:25.392 --> 00:26:26.511
with you being here tonight?

00:26:26.991 --> 00:26:27.592
It's fine.

00:26:27.952 --> 00:26:28.711
Just one night.

00:26:29.031 --> 00:26:30.311
Until the election is over.

00:26:31.112 --> 00:26:32.912
Tomorrow's the big battle.

00:26:33.432 --> 00:26:34.791
Go prepare your speech

00:26:34.791 --> 00:26:35.952
instead of drawing.

00:26:42.231 --> 00:26:42.991
Listen to me.

00:26:43.592 --> 00:26:46.392
Your two rivals
are not to be underestimated.

00:26:47.672 --> 00:26:49.751
One has extensive political experience

00:26:50.192 --> 00:26:51.751
and is as steady as a rock.

00:26:52.192 --> 00:26:54.551
The other is both cunning and capable.

00:26:55.352 --> 00:26:57.192
You need to watch out
for that cunning one.

00:26:58.432 --> 00:26:59.152
Do you hear me?

00:27:02.392 --> 00:27:04.952
I've heard plenty about him
at the government office.

00:27:05.551 --> 00:27:07.311
They say to help villagers get rich,

00:27:08.352 --> 00:27:10.231
he ran shops, grew fruit,

00:27:10.711 --> 00:27:11.551
and raised turtles.

00:27:13.031 --> 00:27:14.751
Now he's
the secretary of Jiangku District.

00:27:15.152 --> 00:27:16.152
He's caused quite a stir.

00:27:17.991 --> 00:27:19.751
I'm really worried for you.

00:27:20.271 --> 00:27:21.551
What is your strength?

00:27:22.112 --> 00:27:23.311
What have you ever raised?

00:27:23.711 --> 00:27:24.231
Liu,

00:27:25.112 --> 00:27:26.592
what do you think my strength is?

00:27:32.231 --> 00:27:32.751
Decheng,

00:27:33.112 --> 00:27:34.152
having confidence

00:27:34.231 --> 00:27:35.152
is surely good.

00:27:36.031 --> 00:27:37.672
But don't underestimate your opponents.

00:27:37.672 --> 00:27:38.192
Understand?

00:27:38.511 --> 00:27:41.071
Your two competitors
are tough nuts to crack.

00:27:41.511 --> 00:27:42.311
Be it Cai Gang

00:27:42.471 --> 00:27:43.672
or Li Qiuping...

00:27:43.952 --> 00:27:44.672
Wait, I remember.

00:27:44.672 --> 00:27:45.711
Aren't I making sense?

00:27:45.751 --> 00:27:46.271
Dapeng,

00:27:46.832 --> 00:27:48.192
there's this foreign phrase.

00:27:48.392 --> 00:27:50.112
Read forward, it's 'men litter.'

00:27:50.192 --> 00:27:51.512
Read backward, it's 'litter men.'

00:27:51.632 --> 00:27:52.551
What does it mean?

00:27:54.432 --> 00:27:55.071
Litter men?

00:27:57.432 --> 00:27:57.991
Little man.

00:27:57.991 --> 00:27:58.952
Or small man.

00:27:59.192 --> 00:28:00.112
Small man?

00:28:00.432 --> 00:28:01.392
What does that mean?

00:28:02.352 --> 00:28:03.432
You don't know

00:28:03.432 --> 00:28:04.192
what that means?

00:28:04.352 --> 00:28:05.912
It describes a man

00:28:05.991 --> 00:28:07.832
who's narrow-minded and petty.

00:28:07.952 --> 00:28:08.511
Who said that?

00:28:08.592 --> 00:28:09.471
Am I narrow-minded?

00:28:09.872 --> 00:28:10.551
Not at all.

00:28:10.751 --> 00:28:11.271
Not at all.

00:28:12.112 --> 00:28:13.791
Then how do you say 'small woman'?

00:28:13.991 --> 00:28:14.672
I know this one.

00:28:15.071 --> 00:28:15.592
I know.

00:28:15.672 --> 00:28:16.711
Hold on, let me think.

00:28:19.192 --> 00:28:20.271
Litter woman.

00:28:21.791 --> 00:28:22.832
Litter woman?

00:28:24.352 --> 00:28:25.231
Wait, Decheng.

00:28:25.592 --> 00:28:27.471
Does it relate to the election
of tomorrow?

00:28:27.592 --> 00:28:29.311
With your level,
maybe stop teaching Dad.

00:28:29.432 --> 00:28:30.392
It's 'little woman.'

00:28:30.471 --> 00:28:31.432
What's the difference?

00:28:31.551 --> 00:28:32.791
Isn't that 'litter woman'?

00:28:32.791 --> 00:28:33.031
Yeah.

00:28:33.031 --> 00:28:34.112
What accent is that?

00:28:34.192 --> 00:28:35.271
Mine is better than yours.

00:28:35.471 --> 00:28:36.632
Stop bickering.

00:28:36.952 --> 00:28:37.672
Litter woman.

00:28:38.471 --> 00:28:39.791
Litter woman.

00:28:41.791 --> 00:28:43.672
Litter woman.

00:28:44.832 --> 00:28:46.112
As for Zheng Decheng,

00:28:46.271 --> 00:28:47.791
I experienced him firsthand recently.

00:28:48.392 --> 00:28:49.352
He's quite the rascal.

00:28:50.432 --> 00:28:51.231
Right?

00:28:51.912 --> 00:28:52.432
What can you

00:28:52.432 --> 00:28:53.672
do with a rascal?

00:28:54.991 --> 00:28:56.071
What can I do?

00:28:56.432 --> 00:28:58.751
I'll hit him hard with this.

00:29:00.832 --> 00:29:02.592
You spent all night on this. Be careful.

00:29:02.751 --> 00:29:03.271
Time for bed.

00:29:03.271 --> 00:29:03.711
Right.

00:29:16.912 --> 00:29:18.352
Great Bolshevik,

00:29:18.711 --> 00:29:19.592
I am Lenin.

00:29:20.192 --> 00:29:20.872
Lenin.

00:29:35.271 --> 00:29:36.471
Nothing feels right.

00:29:37.832 --> 00:29:39.192
Lend me some of your clothes.

00:29:39.832 --> 00:29:40.952
My speech is tomorrow.

00:29:41.471 --> 00:29:43.311
My clothes aren't as good as yours.

00:29:45.271 --> 00:29:45.832
Decheng,

00:29:46.192 --> 00:29:46.751
you are

00:29:47.031 --> 00:29:48.672
so eager to build a city there.

00:29:49.311 --> 00:29:51.112
Is this about my sister's dying wish?

00:29:55.471 --> 00:29:55.991
Decheng,

00:29:56.511 --> 00:29:57.352
tomorrow's election

00:29:57.471 --> 00:29:59.392
has caused quite a stir
throughout the county.

00:29:59.471 --> 00:30:00.471
Your two rivals

00:30:00.551 --> 00:30:02.192
are the County Committee Office's star

00:30:02.311 --> 00:30:04.592
and the most reliable cadre
recognized county-wide.

00:30:04.872 --> 00:30:06.632
You need to take this seriously.

00:30:06.791 --> 00:30:08.071
If you don't, you'll lose.

00:30:09.511 --> 00:30:10.152
Lose?

00:30:11.271 --> 00:30:12.672
What are you talking about?

00:30:12.991 --> 00:30:13.711
Listen to me.

00:30:14.352 --> 00:30:17.471
The Standing Committee will make
an official decision tomorrow afternoon.

00:30:18.031 --> 00:30:21.952
appointing me, Zheng Decheng,
as Secretary of Yuehai.

00:30:42.791 --> 00:30:43.271
Mr. Cai.

00:30:43.632 --> 00:30:44.352
You're here early.

00:30:45.832 --> 00:30:46.711
Nice suit.

00:30:52.791 --> 00:30:53.511
Li.

00:30:54.511 --> 00:30:55.432
Zheng Decheng.

00:30:55.872 --> 00:30:56.872
Your seat is over there.

00:30:58.231 --> 00:30:58.952
Come here.

00:30:59.152 --> 00:30:59.592
Come on.

00:30:59.872 --> 00:31:01.071
(Drawing box)
Draw your order of appearance.

00:31:01.511 --> 00:31:02.392
Lady first then.

00:31:02.432 --> 00:31:03.152
Yes, you go first.

00:31:03.352 --> 00:31:04.511
Alright, I'll go first.

00:31:06.672 --> 00:31:07.352
Mr. Cai, you go.

00:31:07.352 --> 00:31:07.872
You go first.

00:31:07.872 --> 00:31:08.432
You first.

00:31:08.432 --> 00:31:08.872
It's fine.

00:31:08.991 --> 00:31:09.872
Don't be too polite.

00:31:09.872 --> 00:31:11.471
Too much politeness wastes time.

00:31:14.200 --> 00:31:15.096
(No. 1)

00:31:16.984 --> 00:31:17.848
(No. 2)

00:31:18.711 --> 00:31:20.231
You'll follow this order later.

00:31:20.551 --> 00:31:21.231
(No. 3)
Okay, Mr. Guan.

00:31:21.271 --> 00:31:21.711
Okay.

00:31:24.832 --> 00:31:25.632
Sir, your jacket.

00:31:26.751 --> 00:31:27.392
Thanks.

00:31:31.112 --> 00:31:31.751
Guan,

00:31:32.592 --> 00:31:33.832
that's a nice jacket you have.

00:31:34.311 --> 00:31:36.192
Lend it to me. Lend it to me.

00:31:36.192 --> 00:31:37.231
I've caught a cold.

00:31:37.231 --> 00:31:38.672
- I...
- I'll give you mine.

00:31:38.791 --> 00:31:40.311
You...

00:31:40.672 --> 00:31:41.271
It's fine.

00:31:41.592 --> 00:31:42.031
Wait.

00:31:42.031 --> 00:31:42.991
- I put it on this morning.
- Hurry.

00:31:43.112 --> 00:31:43.991
- It's clean.
- Hurry.

00:31:43.991 --> 00:31:44.912
Smell it. It's clean.

00:31:45.071 --> 00:31:45.872
(No. 1)
You have a cold.

00:31:45.991 --> 00:31:47.311
Just smell it. Smell it.

00:31:48.311 --> 00:31:48.832
Prepare well.

00:31:48.832 --> 00:31:49.912
Take it. Don't get sick.

00:31:50.152 --> 00:31:50.672
Look at you.

00:31:50.872 --> 00:31:51.511
You...

00:31:53.912 --> 00:31:54.711
Want to swap?

00:31:55.112 --> 00:31:55.711
No.

00:31:55.991 --> 00:31:56.432
Miss Li,

00:31:56.551 --> 00:31:57.832
if you don't want to go first,

00:31:58.112 --> 00:31:58.432
we...

00:31:58.432 --> 00:31:59.471
Fine. I'll swap with you.

00:32:00.711 --> 00:32:01.311
Okay.

00:32:01.551 --> 00:32:02.071
Mr. Cai.

00:32:02.912 --> 00:32:04.152
Don't want to be next to me?

00:32:04.551 --> 00:32:05.208
That's not it.

00:32:05.432 --> 00:32:06.192
Miss Li is young.

00:32:06.231 --> 00:32:08.231
It might be too stressful
for her to go first.

00:32:16.484 --> 00:32:18.603
(Cai Gang, Li Qiuping, Zheng Decheng)

00:32:18.603 --> 00:32:19.952
(Yuehai Town, Pingchuan County)

00:32:19.952 --> 00:32:20.344
Come on.

00:32:20.592 --> 00:32:21.471
Mr. Zhao, here.

00:32:22.952 --> 00:32:23.592
Ready?

00:32:40.152 --> 00:32:40.912
We can begin.

00:32:41.952 --> 00:32:43.031
Well, who's first?

00:32:43.711 --> 00:32:45.271
Mr. Zhao, I'm first.

00:32:46.592 --> 00:32:46.952
Okay.

00:33:00.760 --> 00:33:02.616
(Secretary Election of
Yuehai Town, Pingchuan County)

00:33:10.791 --> 00:33:11.632
Leaders,

00:33:13.152 --> 00:33:15.392
I am Cai Gang
from the County Land Bureau.

00:33:17.832 --> 00:33:19.711
I've been working for 23 years.

00:33:20.711 --> 00:33:22.511
In my work position,

00:33:22.672 --> 00:33:25.511
I have always been diligent
and conscientious.

00:33:26.152 --> 00:33:28.192
I've received commendations 23 times.

00:33:28.592 --> 00:33:31.751
Looking back,
under the leadership of Magistrate Xia,

00:33:32.031 --> 00:33:35.192
I received verbal praise
over a hundred times.

00:33:36.832 --> 00:33:37.551
Cai Gang,

00:33:37.832 --> 00:33:38.912
get straight to the point.

00:33:39.551 --> 00:33:40.751
We're aware of the information

00:33:40.751 --> 00:33:41.872
you just mentioned.

00:33:43.352 --> 00:33:44.432
Okay.

00:33:45.471 --> 00:33:46.832
The point.

00:33:54.632 --> 00:33:55.231
So nervous?

00:33:55.231 --> 00:33:56.672
It's fine. He's a veteran.

00:33:57.432 --> 00:33:57.991
Mr. Zhao,

00:33:58.751 --> 00:33:59.991
he is a bit nervous.

00:34:01.271 --> 00:34:02.352
Don't be nervous.

00:34:08.312 --> 00:34:12.792
I believe for Yuehai to establish itself
quickly in the early stages,

00:34:13.591 --> 00:34:15.912
it must first secure support
from state-owned enterprises

00:34:16.471 --> 00:34:19.151
to solve the early-stage
city-building funding issue.

00:34:20.551 --> 00:34:21.551
Wrong thought.

00:34:22.471 --> 00:34:23.591
Zheng Decheng,

00:34:23.872 --> 00:34:24.952
you are a candidate,

00:34:25.151 --> 00:34:26.432
not a judge.

00:34:27.151 --> 00:34:29.392
If we estimate 500 workers per factory,

00:34:29.752 --> 00:34:31.071
plus their family members,

00:34:31.352 --> 00:34:36.312
then Yuehai's initial population
must reach at least 10,000.

00:34:37.832 --> 00:34:38.752
Li,

00:34:39.712 --> 00:34:41.232
you don't think the same way, do you?

00:34:41.511 --> 00:34:43.111
That could be one approach.

00:34:43.752 --> 00:34:45.031
Therefore, my goal is

00:34:45.432 --> 00:34:48.872
to have Yuehai reach a population
of 20,000 within one year.

00:34:49.551 --> 00:34:51.792
And the primary economic source
for city development

00:34:52.392 --> 00:34:54.272
will come
from state-owned enterprises' revenue.

00:34:54.631 --> 00:34:56.752
That will drive local economic growth.

00:34:58.151 --> 00:35:00.392
That's my plan for building Yuehai.

00:35:01.392 --> 00:35:02.232
Leaders,

00:35:07.071 --> 00:35:08.511
I'm willing to step forward

00:35:08.912 --> 00:35:11.031
and shoulder my due responsibility.

00:35:27.151 --> 00:35:27.792
Mr. Zhao,

00:35:27.912 --> 00:35:29.912
I think Cai Gang's idea is quite solid

00:35:29.952 --> 00:35:31.432
and highly feasible.

00:35:35.991 --> 00:35:37.872
Miss Li, it's your turn.

00:35:38.191 --> 00:35:38.551
Okay.

00:35:42.872 --> 00:35:43.591
Li,

00:35:44.752 --> 00:35:45.272
relax.

00:35:45.952 --> 00:35:46.591
You've got this.

00:35:47.671 --> 00:35:48.111
Thank you.

00:35:48.551 --> 00:35:49.191
You're welcome.

00:35:49.631 --> 00:35:50.352
Litter woman.

00:35:52.151 --> 00:35:52.832
Naive.

00:36:00.832 --> 00:36:02.031
Respected leaders,

00:36:02.232 --> 00:36:02.832
hello.

00:36:03.031 --> 00:36:04.031
I'm Li Qiuping.

00:36:04.471 --> 00:36:07.071
While co-authoring
the Pingchuan County Annals,

00:36:07.191 --> 00:36:08.712
I often heard locals say

00:36:08.991 --> 00:36:09.631
Yuehai is a...

00:36:09.631 --> 00:36:10.191
Mr. Cai,

00:36:11.232 --> 00:36:12.591
don't be nervous. Just relax.

00:36:13.671 --> 00:36:14.272
It's okay.

00:36:15.392 --> 00:36:16.111
I'm relaxed.

00:36:16.991 --> 00:36:17.352
Right?

00:36:18.272 --> 00:36:18.792
Today,

00:36:18.952 --> 00:36:20.792
I'm deeply honored to stand here

00:36:21.151 --> 00:36:24.312
to present three visions
for building Yuehai.

00:36:24.671 --> 00:36:26.008
Road construction through loans,

00:36:26.352 --> 00:36:27.312
pillar industries,

00:36:27.631 --> 00:36:29.191
and city character.

00:36:30.272 --> 00:36:31.872
I've brought something to show you.

00:36:43.191 --> 00:36:43.912
What is this?

00:36:44.191 --> 00:36:45.631
Why so many markings on it?

00:36:45.991 --> 00:36:48.031
This is a city planning map I designed.

00:36:48.511 --> 00:36:51.591
I participated in Yuehai's
preliminary planning and surveying,

00:36:51.912 --> 00:36:54.352
gaining a deeper understanding
of this land.

00:36:54.752 --> 00:36:57.111
I discovered its topography and location

00:36:57.392 --> 00:36:59.551
share similarities with some cities

00:36:59.712 --> 00:37:02.312
I visited during my studies in France.

00:37:02.671 --> 00:37:04.031
We can emulate them

00:37:04.352 --> 00:37:06.591
by turning disadvantages into strengths.

00:37:06.872 --> 00:37:08.912
As the saying goes,
pave the way to prosperity.

00:37:09.232 --> 00:37:12.071
Building roads can connect Yuehai
to the outside world quickly,

00:37:12.352 --> 00:37:14.792
laying foundations
for population and capital inflow.

00:37:15.151 --> 00:37:16.151
A city comes alive

00:37:16.471 --> 00:37:18.272
when transportation thrives.

00:37:18.991 --> 00:37:20.191
Is road construction so novel?

00:37:20.872 --> 00:37:22.191
France? Well...

00:37:22.312 --> 00:37:23.232
Is this necessary?

00:37:24.631 --> 00:37:26.232
Her roads differ from ordinary ones.

00:37:26.631 --> 00:37:27.151
Now,

00:37:27.471 --> 00:37:31.111
I'll detail my planning map.

00:37:32.031 --> 00:37:33.392
Please look at this map.

00:37:34.671 --> 00:37:35.551
Li Qiuping,

00:37:36.432 --> 00:37:38.591
Songxiang is a six-century-old town

00:37:38.912 --> 00:37:41.312
with its North Gate Street
just four meters wide.

00:37:41.872 --> 00:37:45.272
Jiangku's east-west street,
a main artery, is only five meters.

00:37:46.031 --> 00:37:48.471
Your barely-existent Yuehai Town

00:37:48.631 --> 00:37:51.352
plans forty-to-fifty-meter-wide avenues?

00:37:51.712 --> 00:37:54.071
This is sheer land wastage.

00:37:54.511 --> 00:37:55.752
Exactly. How irresponsible.

00:37:55.752 --> 00:37:56.151
Right?

00:37:56.151 --> 00:37:57.872
I believe with Reform and Opening Up,

00:37:58.232 --> 00:37:59.272
in the near future,

00:37:59.272 --> 00:38:01.631
private car ownership
will become universal in China.

00:38:02.232 --> 00:38:03.111
Wide roads

00:38:03.191 --> 00:38:06.392
can address increasing vehicles
and traffic congestion.

00:38:07.232 --> 00:38:07.991
Li Qiuping,

00:38:08.272 --> 00:38:10.392
ignoring your truck example,

00:38:10.792 --> 00:38:13.071
but predicting universal private cars
within 30 years

00:38:13.392 --> 00:38:14.832
is overly idealistic, isn't it?

00:38:15.551 --> 00:38:16.671
Let her finish first.

00:38:16.671 --> 00:38:17.031
Well,

00:38:17.071 --> 00:38:18.312
this isn't just idealism.

00:38:18.511 --> 00:38:19.071
Leaders,

00:38:19.272 --> 00:38:22.432
I not only foresee
universal private cars in 30 years

00:38:23.272 --> 00:38:24.191
but also believe

00:38:24.471 --> 00:38:27.312
Yuehai will become the next Nanzhou

00:38:27.471 --> 00:38:28.991
or even the next Shanghai.

00:38:29.432 --> 00:38:30.591
I dare say this

00:38:30.671 --> 00:38:33.272
because I recognize
Yuehai's latent advantage:

00:38:33.432 --> 00:38:35.352
building pillar industries.

00:38:36.631 --> 00:38:37.991
Speaking of pillar industries,

00:38:38.312 --> 00:38:40.511
what do you propose for Yuehai?

00:38:41.392 --> 00:38:44.111
Pingchuan County
already has foundations in the printing

00:38:44.111 --> 00:38:45.471
and textile industries.

00:38:45.752 --> 00:38:47.191
They just haven't reached scale yet.

00:38:47.432 --> 00:38:50.272
As the saying goes,
great oaks from little acorns grow.

00:38:50.832 --> 00:38:56.031
By integrating advantageous industries
into what we call pillar industries,

00:38:56.392 --> 00:38:57.792
plus the transportation network,

00:38:57.792 --> 00:39:00.511
we can deliver
our local products nationwide,

00:39:00.752 --> 00:39:02.272
even worldwide.

00:39:02.792 --> 00:39:03.272
Well.

00:39:03.392 --> 00:39:04.912
This is pure fantasy.

00:39:07.832 --> 00:39:08.912
Pillar industries?

00:39:09.071 --> 00:39:10.191
Worldwide?

00:39:10.631 --> 00:39:11.712
And printing?

00:39:12.232 --> 00:39:14.392
Why wouldn't people
go to Beijing or Shanghai?

00:39:14.872 --> 00:39:16.551
Why would they have to come here?

00:39:17.151 --> 00:39:18.312
It's daydreaming.

00:39:19.232 --> 00:39:20.191
This idea isn't bad.

00:39:22.471 --> 00:39:23.312
Li Qiuping,

00:39:23.832 --> 00:39:25.712
let me summarize what you just said.

00:39:25.872 --> 00:39:27.551
You mentioned the city's character.

00:39:28.432 --> 00:39:31.591
Can it be achieved solely
by improving residents' quality?

00:39:32.232 --> 00:39:32.712
Yes.

00:39:33.191 --> 00:39:35.872
In the building of Yuehai City,

00:39:36.151 --> 00:39:38.232
I will guide
and improve residents' quality.

00:39:38.792 --> 00:39:40.591
We must build
and maintain simultaneously,

00:39:40.792 --> 00:39:42.912
establishing
an orderly and progressive city

00:39:43.151 --> 00:39:46.071
so that Yuehai
has its own distinct city character.

00:39:52.312 --> 00:39:54.191
What's the use of doing this now?

00:39:54.712 --> 00:39:55.671
A city has character?

00:39:56.352 --> 00:39:57.312
That's all.

00:39:57.912 --> 00:39:58.792
Thank you, leaders.

00:40:06.551 --> 00:40:09.071
This is the first time
I've heard such a notion.

00:40:10.071 --> 00:40:12.671
All this talk is just fluff.

00:40:16.832 --> 00:40:17.631
Li,

00:40:18.031 --> 00:40:20.151
I'd only heard of 'armchair generals,'

00:40:20.671 --> 00:40:22.912
but never thought
I'd see one in the flesh.

00:40:23.352 --> 00:40:24.631
But for an armchair general,

00:40:24.832 --> 00:40:25.631
you're quite good.

00:40:26.471 --> 00:40:27.551
Your turn, little man.

00:40:57.392 --> 00:40:58.832
I won't bother introducing myself.

00:40:59.912 --> 00:41:02.872
Regarding building Yuehai City,
I have only one phrase.

00:41:03.031 --> 00:41:03.591
Zheng Decheng,

00:41:03.952 --> 00:41:05.432
stop beating around the bush.

00:41:06.232 --> 00:41:06.952
Speak plainly.

00:41:10.392 --> 00:41:12.912
A people's city is built by the people.

00:41:14.752 --> 00:41:15.591
Elaborate on that.

00:41:16.952 --> 00:41:19.671
The county has no funds
to support Yuehai's construction.

00:41:20.232 --> 00:41:21.272
So I believe

00:41:21.752 --> 00:41:25.071
we can only mobilize the 'monkeys'
from each township

00:41:25.551 --> 00:41:27.000
to become Yuehai's first citizens.

00:41:27.151 --> 00:41:28.071
I've calculated

00:41:28.191 --> 00:41:31.551
that each family
would need 6,000 to 10,000 yuan

00:41:31.752 --> 00:41:33.031
to settle in Yuehai.

00:41:33.392 --> 00:41:35.392
Only 'monkeys'
have this financial foundation.

00:41:36.151 --> 00:41:37.952
Therefore, I believe

00:41:38.352 --> 00:41:41.471
Yuehai's first citizens
must primarily be 'monkeys.'

00:41:42.352 --> 00:41:43.151
'Monkeys'?

00:41:43.551 --> 00:41:44.191
Mr. Zhao,

00:41:44.272 --> 00:41:45.392
we locals refer to...

00:41:45.392 --> 00:41:46.352
What 'monkeys'?

00:41:46.631 --> 00:41:47.991
They're 10,000-yuan households.

00:41:48.832 --> 00:41:49.551
Mr. Zhao,

00:41:49.832 --> 00:41:51.631
you might not be fully aware yet.

00:41:52.191 --> 00:41:54.352
The traditional character
for 'ten thousand'...

00:41:54.591 --> 00:41:57.232
It looks like a monkey
hanging from a tree with both hands.

00:41:57.912 --> 00:42:00.031
So the 'monkeys'
are the 10,000-yuan households.

00:42:00.591 --> 00:42:01.111
Miss Li,

00:42:01.191 --> 00:42:02.952
your time in the grassroots
wasn't wasted.

00:42:04.471 --> 00:42:05.191
Zheng Decheng.

00:42:05.912 --> 00:42:07.792
(Ten thousand)
If it's all 'monkeys,'

00:42:08.272 --> 00:42:12.232
what would Yuehai Town's
total population even be?

00:42:13.952 --> 00:42:14.671
Fifty thousand.

00:42:19.392 --> 00:42:20.151
Fifty thousand?

00:42:20.792 --> 00:42:22.352
Wait, are you joking?

00:42:22.551 --> 00:42:24.071
This isn't some fairy tale.

00:42:25.511 --> 00:42:26.104
Zheng Decheng,

00:42:26.752 --> 00:42:27.752
you can't talk nonsense.

00:42:28.232 --> 00:42:29.151
Back that up.

00:42:29.432 --> 00:42:32.191
As of now, Pingchuan County

00:42:32.631 --> 00:42:35.071
has around 6,000 farming 'monkeys.'

00:42:35.551 --> 00:42:38.232
Assuming five people per household,

00:42:38.511 --> 00:42:40.991
that adds up to over 30,000 residents.

00:42:41.392 --> 00:42:44.912
Plus the 7,000 or 8,000
original Yuehai villagers,

00:42:45.712 --> 00:42:47.071
it totals over 40,000 people.

00:42:47.952 --> 00:42:49.551
So within a year,

00:42:49.671 --> 00:42:50.952
reaching a population of 50,000

00:42:51.352 --> 00:42:52.632
is absolutely not a fairy tale.
