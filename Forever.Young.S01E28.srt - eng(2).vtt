00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:37.920
Big Bro, about Tongtong, I...

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:38.879
Yes, I do have feelings for her.

00:01:38.879 --> 00:01:40.079
But that thing with sister-in-law...

00:01:40.079 --> 00:01:41.599
It wasn't really collusion, just...

00:01:41.599 --> 00:01:42.920
giving a little suggestion, that's all.

00:01:43.400 --> 00:01:46.120
Your suggestion to your sister-in-law was not to come back, right?

00:01:46.120 --> 00:01:47.159
No, it was Tongtong, Tongtong...

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:47.920
Right, it was Tongtong, not me.

00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:48.799
There's a lot going on downstairs.

00:01:48.799 --> 00:01:49.519
Hurry up, get down there.

00:01:49.519 --> 00:01:52.359
No, no, what's going on with you? Back then...

00:01:59.959 --> 00:02:01.120
I say, Lao Kai...

00:02:01.120 --> 00:02:02.400
What are you trying to do now?

00:02:02.760 --> 00:02:04.640
We agreed that I would take care of Yuanyuan today.

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:06.159
Sorry, Tom. (Support Admin Watch on

00:02:06.439 --> 00:02:09.400
Jenny has been looking forward to this piano master's concert for so long.

00:02:09.400 --> 00:02:10.479
Originally, there were no tickets left.

00:02:10.479 --> 00:02:11.680
But the organizers...

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:13.159
specially arranged seats for us.

00:02:13.319 --> 00:02:16.000
So I don't want her to miss this chance.

00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:16.840
No...

00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:19.080
How come every time I'm with Yuanyuan...

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:20.400
there are so many sudden things?

00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:22.080
Jenny...

00:02:23.439 --> 00:02:26.960
You've been looking forward to this concert for a long time, haven't you?

00:02:27.479 --> 00:02:28.919
Then tell Daddy...

00:02:28.919 --> 00:02:30.800
this is a very rare opportunity.

00:02:38.960 --> 00:02:40.919
Yuanyuan, then you go.

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:42.080
Practice the piano well.

00:02:42.159 --> 00:02:44.400
In the future, you can become a master too.

00:02:46.599 --> 00:02:47.560
Come on, Jenny.

00:02:47.759 --> 00:02:48.360
Come here.

00:02:49.639 --> 00:02:52.439
But I want to stay with Daddy today.

00:02:56.400 --> 00:02:59.000
And also, I don't want to emigrate.

00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:02.000
I want to stay with Daddy forever.

00:03:03.960 --> 00:03:04.639
Alright.

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:05.960
It seems...

00:03:06.439 --> 00:03:08.319
what's yours is yours.

00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:11.000
What isn't yours, you can't keep anyway.

00:03:11.319 --> 00:03:12.360
You see now, don't you?

00:03:12.879 --> 00:03:14.879
Having money doesn't mean you can take everything.

00:03:15.639 --> 00:03:16.680
You've misunderstood.

00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:19.120
I don't want to take anything away.

00:03:20.960 --> 00:03:21.840
Goodbye.

00:03:24.639 --> 00:03:26.360
The things I want...

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:27.159
other people...

00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:29.639
will hand to me with both hands.

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:36.360
What? What does this foreigner mean?

00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:39.120
He's not happy he couldn't take Yuanyuan away.

00:03:39.240 --> 00:03:41.319
Yuanyuan, Auntie will take you upstairs to play for a bit.

00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:43.000
Go on, go with Auntie.

00:03:43.840 --> 00:03:44.919
Go on, be careful.

00:03:44.919 --> 00:03:45.960
There's water upstairs.

00:03:45.960 --> 00:03:46.599
Drink some water.

00:03:46.599 --> 00:03:47.080
I know.

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:51.120
It's fine.

00:03:51.680 --> 00:03:53.000
After all, he's the investor.

00:03:53.719 --> 00:03:55.159
Don't make things too awkward.

00:03:57.400 --> 00:03:59.240
Feifei gege, Feifei gege!

00:03:59.240 --> 00:04:00.159
What are you doing?

00:04:00.319 --> 00:04:01.319
Play with me for a while.

00:04:01.439 --> 00:04:02.319
What's this?

00:04:02.319 --> 00:04:02.879
This...

00:04:02.879 --> 00:04:04.120
Go, go play over there.

00:04:09.319 --> 00:04:10.719
What's wrong, son?

00:04:12.439 --> 00:04:13.639
We're all here.

00:04:16.639 --> 00:04:17.920
Alright, come here.

00:04:18.920 --> 00:04:19.920
What's going on here?

00:04:20.240 --> 00:04:21.639
What's the matter, really?

00:04:22.319 --> 00:04:23.240
Talk to us.

00:04:27.480 --> 00:04:28.399
You all know.

00:04:31.079 --> 00:04:32.160
What's wrong?

00:04:39.480 --> 00:04:40.920
It's nothing, son.

00:04:41.160 --> 00:04:43.360
Son, why are you crying?

00:04:45.160 --> 00:04:46.439
Let's not cry.

00:04:51.160 --> 00:04:54.199
Alright, I'll admit my mistake first.

00:04:54.600 --> 00:04:56.879
I really shouldn't have lied to you three.

00:04:57.879 --> 00:05:00.480
I was fired from my job.

00:05:01.680 --> 00:05:03.160
So, Third Brother, your investment money...

00:05:03.160 --> 00:05:04.680
don't leave it with me anymore.

00:05:04.879 --> 00:05:06.879
And Penglexuan's...

00:05:07.480 --> 00:05:10.319
that account, don't even think about keeping it with me.

00:05:10.319 --> 00:05:11.600
I don't have the ability for that now.

00:05:11.600 --> 00:05:12.399
But don't worry.

00:05:12.399 --> 00:05:13.160
I've thought it through.

00:05:13.160 --> 00:05:14.680
I have to shoulder this myself.

00:05:15.079 --> 00:05:16.600
I'll just start looking for a new job first.

00:05:16.600 --> 00:05:18.199
Get my own situation settled first.

00:05:18.639 --> 00:05:20.199
You can all rest assured.

00:05:20.360 --> 00:05:20.959
Really.

00:05:21.560 --> 00:05:22.759
Start over properly.

00:05:26.360 --> 00:05:27.639
Good for you, Qiu'er.

00:05:29.199 --> 00:05:30.279
And then?

00:05:30.839 --> 00:05:32.160
The three of us have also discussed it.

00:05:32.839 --> 00:05:34.120
Your position at the restaurant...

00:05:35.160 --> 00:05:37.600
no matter how you fare in the future...

00:05:38.079 --> 00:05:39.240
we'll keep it for you.

00:05:44.040 --> 00:05:44.800
Yuanyuan...

00:05:48.480 --> 00:05:49.319
Yuanyuan...

00:05:50.160 --> 00:05:51.920
What are you doing here?

00:05:52.800 --> 00:05:54.000
What's going on here?

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:54.600
What?

00:05:54.600 --> 00:05:55.360
What is it?

00:05:57.360 --> 00:05:59.160
The three most beautiful words in the world...

00:05:59.160 --> 00:06:00.319
are "I love you."

00:06:02.160 --> 00:06:03.959
My dear Tongtong jie...

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:05.399
I... I like...

00:06:05.399 --> 00:06:05.959
Who?

00:06:05.959 --> 00:06:06.680
Wang Fei.

00:06:07.600 --> 00:06:09.680
Wang Fei also likes Tongtong.

00:06:11.319 --> 00:06:14.160
Feifei gege, I'm sorry.

00:06:15.040 --> 00:06:15.759
It's okay.

00:07:00.600 --> 00:07:03.160
Wasn't his condition quite stable before?

00:07:03.600 --> 00:07:04.600
How did it just...

00:07:05.120 --> 00:07:07.040
No, we can't delay this any longer.

00:07:07.600 --> 00:07:08.839
Second Brother, here's the plan.

00:07:09.120 --> 00:07:10.439
You get ready these next couple of days.

00:07:10.439 --> 00:07:11.600
Sort out the things on your plate...

00:07:11.600 --> 00:07:12.360
get them in order.

00:07:12.360 --> 00:07:14.399
Once my visa comes through...

00:07:14.399 --> 00:07:16.120
the two of us will take him to the US.

00:07:17.279 --> 00:07:18.279
That won't work.

00:07:18.600 --> 00:07:20.279
Let's just find that professor first.

00:07:21.120 --> 00:07:22.480
We'll kneel at his door...

00:07:22.600 --> 00:07:24.639
and get him to do Weiguo's surgery first.

00:07:25.079 --> 00:07:27.399
If I can go, I'll go with you this time.

00:07:28.639 --> 00:07:29.879
Going won't help.

00:07:31.480 --> 00:07:32.600
What do you mean it won't help?

00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:35.480
There's no special medicine at all.

00:07:36.279 --> 00:07:37.560
He was lying to us.

00:07:40.360 --> 00:07:43.040
No, we all met that professor.

00:07:47.399 --> 00:07:49.360
How could he lie about something like this?

00:07:55.040 --> 00:07:56.600
Did you know about this all along?

00:08:01.120 --> 00:08:01.800
Such a big thing...

00:08:01.800 --> 00:08:03.680
and you didn't tell me earlier?

00:08:03.680 --> 00:08:04.319
No, no, no...

00:08:04.319 --> 00:08:04.759
What are you doing?

00:08:04.759 --> 00:08:06.120
Are you trying to kill him?

00:08:06.120 --> 00:08:07.360
I want to die in his place.

00:08:07.360 --> 00:08:08.199
Can I take his place?

00:08:08.199 --> 00:08:09.240
No, no, no, listen to Second Brother first.

00:08:09.240 --> 00:08:10.079
Keep your voices down, everyone.

00:08:11.639 --> 00:08:12.720
The patient is awake.

00:08:13.560 --> 00:08:14.439
Thank you.

00:08:21.920 --> 00:08:22.639
He's awake.

00:08:29.959 --> 00:08:30.759
So?

00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:33.159
Did I scare you all?

00:08:39.320 --> 00:08:41.360
No, for something this serious, you pull a...

00:08:41.360 --> 00:08:43.639
You pull a fake professor to trick us?

00:08:45.480 --> 00:08:47.240
You're really something else.

00:08:47.840 --> 00:08:49.320
Such a big deal,

00:08:51.200 --> 00:08:52.240
I just now

00:08:53.519 --> 00:08:55.279
suddenly thought of an idea.

00:08:56.879 --> 00:08:58.399
I was thinking,

00:08:59.159 --> 00:09:00.919
before I die,

00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:03.759
I'll eat a bellyful of corn kernels,

00:09:04.960 --> 00:09:06.519
then drink a huge bucket of cream.

00:09:06.879 --> 00:09:09.519
That way, my cremation will be quite a show.

00:09:09.720 --> 00:09:10.559
Pop, pop, pop!

00:09:10.559 --> 00:09:12.320
Can you please stop joking around?

00:09:14.360 --> 00:09:15.159
Listen to me.

00:09:15.159 --> 00:09:16.679
This time, no matter what you say,

00:09:16.919 --> 00:09:18.399
once the test results are out,

00:09:18.519 --> 00:09:19.879
as long as surgery is an option,

00:09:19.879 --> 00:09:21.320
we must go for the surgery.

00:09:21.320 --> 00:09:22.080
Even if I have to stuff you,

00:09:22.080 --> 00:09:24.120
I'll stuff you into that operating room.

00:09:26.679 --> 00:09:27.480
Big Bro,

00:09:30.639 --> 00:09:31.879
can I ask you a question?

00:09:31.879 --> 00:09:33.639
Don't ask. I don't want to hear it.

00:09:33.639 --> 00:09:34.399
Weiguo,

00:09:35.279 --> 00:09:36.919
you take a rest first.

00:09:38.279 --> 00:09:39.639
Do you know

00:09:40.720 --> 00:09:42.320
how high the risk

00:09:43.360 --> 00:09:44.360
of this surgery is?

00:09:44.720 --> 00:09:45.519
Weiguo,

00:09:49.159 --> 00:09:51.600
no matter how high the surgical risk is,

00:09:51.600 --> 00:09:52.919
as long as there's still a chance,

00:09:52.919 --> 00:09:54.559
we have to try.

00:09:55.559 --> 00:09:56.679
At a time like this,

00:09:57.120 --> 00:09:58.440
why think so much?

00:10:00.120 --> 00:10:00.879
Weiguo,

00:10:04.120 --> 00:10:04.799
I'm not afraid.

00:10:07.440 --> 00:10:08.360
Are you afraid?

00:10:09.919 --> 00:10:10.559
Big Bro,

00:10:12.960 --> 00:10:14.600
If you send me in there

00:10:16.759 --> 00:10:18.120
and I never come out,

00:10:19.399 --> 00:10:20.600
will you regret it?

00:10:22.919 --> 00:10:23.559
Look,

00:10:24.919 --> 00:10:26.879
at least I'm still alive and kicking now.

00:10:27.440 --> 00:10:28.480
At least

00:10:29.919 --> 00:10:31.360
I can still 'bounce' for three months.

00:10:31.759 --> 00:10:33.240
That's almost a hundred days.

00:10:46.879 --> 00:10:47.600
Lianbao,

00:10:48.879 --> 00:10:49.559
Qiu'er,

00:10:50.799 --> 00:10:51.679
are you afraid?

00:11:01.240 --> 00:11:02.559
Can you say a little less?

00:11:03.120 --> 00:11:05.039
Whether or not to have surgery,

00:11:05.879 --> 00:11:07.120
we need to eat first.

00:11:09.279 --> 00:11:10.559
Right, right, eat first.

00:11:12.360 --> 00:11:13.799
You talk to him.

00:11:13.799 --> 00:11:14.799
Talk to him properly.

00:11:16.039 --> 00:11:17.679
Okay, it's fine. Don't trouble yourselves.

00:11:17.879 --> 00:11:18.840
It's okay.

00:11:23.120 --> 00:11:24.039
Really, it's fine.

00:11:30.039 --> 00:11:32.240
Um, you stay with him for now.

00:11:32.480 --> 00:11:33.480
I'll come relieve you later.

00:11:33.600 --> 00:11:34.120
Okay.

00:11:34.679 --> 00:11:36.000
No need. You all go attend to your business.

00:11:36.240 --> 00:11:36.600
It's fine.

00:11:36.600 --> 00:11:37.120
I'm heading out.

00:11:47.960 --> 00:11:48.879
Let's eat.

00:12:02.360 --> 00:12:03.639
Big Bro, Qiu'er,

00:12:03.840 --> 00:12:05.039
you all go back first.

00:12:05.120 --> 00:12:06.240
I'll keep an eye on things here.

00:12:07.120 --> 00:12:09.360
No, but there's a lot to do at the restaurant.

00:12:13.240 --> 00:12:14.080
Let's go, Qiu'er.

00:12:15.639 --> 00:12:16.799
Thanks for your hard work.

00:12:33.919 --> 00:12:34.759
Um,

00:12:36.759 --> 00:12:38.320
about Xiaoqi coming to see me,

00:12:38.799 --> 00:12:39.759
you already know?

00:12:42.600 --> 00:12:43.840
He told me everything.

00:12:46.679 --> 00:12:47.919
He was right.

00:12:48.600 --> 00:12:50.279
Actually, I've always...

00:12:52.240 --> 00:12:53.240
I understand.

00:13:01.440 --> 00:13:02.639
Some things,

00:13:03.080 --> 00:13:05.559
I wanted to hear you say them yourself before

00:13:06.080 --> 00:13:08.440
because I thought you were too stubborn.

00:13:09.320 --> 00:13:11.279
I just wanted to teach you a lesson, push you a bit.

00:13:14.559 --> 00:13:16.200
But now you don't need to say anything.

00:13:17.080 --> 00:13:18.559
Because whatever you want to say,

00:13:19.159 --> 00:13:20.200
I already understand.

00:13:23.519 --> 00:13:24.480
I'm sorry.

00:13:25.759 --> 00:13:26.919
Stop with the 'sorry's.

00:13:27.840 --> 00:13:29.360
If you're really sorry,

00:13:29.360 --> 00:13:31.360
how about helping me think now

00:13:31.440 --> 00:13:32.759
about contacting venues.

00:13:35.000 --> 00:13:36.240
Xiaoqi's gone now.

00:13:36.360 --> 00:13:37.600
Time is tight, the task is heavy.

00:13:38.120 --> 00:13:40.200
I really can't handle it alone.

00:13:42.679 --> 00:13:44.159
And you say *I'm* stubborn?

00:13:44.399 --> 00:13:46.080
When I gave you my card before,

00:13:46.360 --> 00:13:47.600
you kept arguing with me.

00:13:49.080 --> 00:13:51.440
Fine, I was wrong, I was wrong, okay?

00:13:51.679 --> 00:13:53.080
Then give me your card now.

00:13:53.159 --> 00:13:53.759
Give it to me.

00:13:54.360 --> 00:13:54.919
Okay.

00:13:55.600 --> 00:13:56.559
Wait a moment.

00:13:59.080 --> 00:13:59.840
Here you go.

00:14:04.360 --> 00:14:04.919
By the way,

00:14:05.240 --> 00:14:07.879
have you seen Feifei these past couple days?

00:14:09.159 --> 00:14:11.000
Why do you have endless worries?

00:14:11.320 --> 00:14:12.600
If you're really that concerned,

00:14:12.600 --> 00:14:14.279
how about helping me contact venues right now?

00:14:15.519 --> 00:14:17.320
What's the big deal about your venue?

00:14:17.519 --> 00:14:18.840
I can handle it easily.

00:14:20.240 --> 00:14:21.000
Don't worry.

00:14:22.679 --> 00:14:23.600
Let's eat.

00:14:45.240 --> 00:14:46.159
What's the situation?

00:14:46.639 --> 00:14:47.480
It's nothing.

00:14:48.559 --> 00:14:50.559
Chunsheng, you're back.

00:14:51.159 --> 00:14:52.399
Don't worry.

00:14:52.639 --> 00:14:54.399
Medicine is so advanced now.

00:14:54.399 --> 00:14:56.120
Beijing has such great medical resources.

00:14:56.159 --> 00:14:57.039
Traditional Chinese medicine, Western medicine.

00:14:57.039 --> 00:14:58.120
If surgery is needed, do surgery.

00:14:58.320 --> 00:14:59.480
If acupuncture is needed, do acupuncture.

00:14:59.720 --> 00:15:00.799
If all else fails,

00:15:00.879 --> 00:15:02.240
I know a master.

00:15:02.240 --> 00:15:03.240
Super effective, really mysterious.

00:15:03.240 --> 00:15:03.799
Alright.

00:15:03.879 --> 00:15:06.320
Dayang, I know you mean well.

00:15:07.519 --> 00:15:09.000
Weiguo will be fine.

00:15:10.399 --> 00:15:11.639
Yangzi, thank you.

00:15:12.240 --> 00:15:13.399
I hope he's okay.

00:15:27.440 --> 00:15:28.559
So what's the deal?

00:15:30.799 --> 00:15:32.879
The specific test results aren't out yet.

00:15:35.840 --> 00:15:37.919
But the surgery still has to be done.

00:15:39.840 --> 00:15:40.840
No, I mean,

00:15:42.039 --> 00:15:44.039
can we make this decision for him?

00:15:48.799 --> 00:15:50.440
If it were my own business,

00:15:52.039 --> 00:15:53.639
I could decide without hesitation.

00:15:54.879 --> 00:15:56.440
But this is Weiguo.

00:16:01.120 --> 00:16:02.879
His uncle and aunt passed away early.

00:16:04.600 --> 00:16:06.200
He doesn't have a wife.

00:16:07.559 --> 00:16:09.360
Not a single child.

00:16:10.440 --> 00:16:11.120
I mean, seriously,

00:16:11.120 --> 00:16:13.039
if we talk him onto the operating table

00:16:14.960 --> 00:16:16.960
and he doesn't come off it, what then?

00:16:19.840 --> 00:16:20.679
Tell me,

00:16:21.519 --> 00:16:23.440
how would we live with ourselves?

00:16:23.440 --> 00:16:24.639
Day after day.

00:16:24.879 --> 00:16:26.759
If we don't persuade him, he could still...

00:16:36.679 --> 00:16:37.720
Don't rush.

00:16:57.639 --> 00:16:58.919
Don't worry.

00:16:58.919 --> 00:17:00.440
The kid and I are doing fine.

00:17:00.440 --> 00:17:02.039
My colleagues are also looking out for me.

00:17:02.039 --> 00:17:03.159
Don't worry, don't worry.

00:17:04.319 --> 00:17:05.039
Dad, Mom.

00:17:08.640 --> 00:17:09.599
Honey.

00:17:12.920 --> 00:17:15.160
Mom, Dad, I'll hang up now.

00:17:15.519 --> 00:17:16.440
Okay, okay, okay.

00:17:16.640 --> 00:17:17.160
Okay.

00:17:17.319 --> 00:17:19.559
Bye, bye, bye.

00:17:31.319 --> 00:17:32.160
Son.

00:17:33.759 --> 00:17:35.519
How is Weiguo doing now?

00:17:37.680 --> 00:17:39.839
He's awake, and even cracking jokes.

00:17:41.680 --> 00:17:42.640
Good heavens.

00:17:42.640 --> 00:17:43.319
Son.

00:17:48.960 --> 00:17:52.039
Do you remember always listening to your Third Grandpa

00:17:52.039 --> 00:17:53.680
tell you that story when you were little?

00:17:53.680 --> 00:17:55.440
The story of "The Boy Who Cried Wolf"?

00:17:55.559 --> 00:17:57.160
Why are you bringing this up now?

00:17:57.160 --> 00:17:58.160
Just talk about it.

00:17:58.160 --> 00:17:59.920
Talk about it, talk about it.

00:18:00.160 --> 00:18:01.960
It's about a kid

00:18:02.680 --> 00:18:03.799
who kept lying.

00:18:04.319 --> 00:18:05.440
He'd cry "Wolf!"

00:18:05.920 --> 00:18:07.920
He lied so much, no one believed him anymore.

00:18:07.920 --> 00:18:09.400
Finally, the wolf really came

00:18:09.599 --> 00:18:10.960
and ate the kid.

00:18:12.759 --> 00:18:13.640
No.

00:18:14.440 --> 00:18:16.960
You've got the story wrong. No.

00:18:17.400 --> 00:18:20.759
Every three-year-old knows this story.

00:18:21.039 --> 00:18:22.759
That's how it goes.

00:18:24.319 --> 00:18:26.519
The ending of the story is,

00:18:26.519 --> 00:18:28.039
the wolf came, right?

00:18:28.319 --> 00:18:30.559
The kid turned into a big tiger.

00:18:30.759 --> 00:18:32.920
The tiger ate the wolf.

00:18:34.839 --> 00:18:35.680
Understand?

00:18:36.720 --> 00:18:37.400
Dad.

00:18:38.440 --> 00:18:39.039
Mom.

00:18:40.759 --> 00:18:41.960
I'm sorry.

00:18:43.319 --> 00:18:44.759
I shouldn't have lied to you.

00:18:49.119 --> 00:18:50.440
Silly boy.

00:18:51.519 --> 00:18:53.599
Better to become a big tiger yourself

00:18:53.599 --> 00:18:55.920
than to be eaten by the wolf.

00:18:55.920 --> 00:18:56.759
Understand?

00:19:06.559 --> 00:19:07.599
Good that you understand.

00:19:26.200 --> 00:19:26.960
Jing'er.

00:19:27.559 --> 00:19:28.799
Pour a glass of water.

00:19:48.160 --> 00:19:49.559
When we left,

00:19:49.720 --> 00:19:51.000
he was sitting right there.

00:19:51.000 --> 00:19:53.079
Now we're back, and he's still sitting there.

00:19:53.079 --> 00:19:54.079
Hasn't moved an inch.

00:19:54.519 --> 00:19:56.400
We forgot about him all day.

00:19:58.519 --> 00:20:01.960
Before, it was always "Third Uncle this, Third Uncle that."

00:20:01.960 --> 00:20:03.240
Now that Weiguo is in this state,

00:20:03.240 --> 00:20:04.960
you'd think he'd at least ask about him.

00:20:05.839 --> 00:20:08.440
He likes Tongtong, and then

00:20:09.119 --> 00:20:10.599
his Third Uncle and...

00:20:13.160 --> 00:20:14.839
You think he and Tongtong...

00:20:14.839 --> 00:20:16.440
He... he... he wouldn't...

00:20:17.000 --> 00:20:19.160
What if he gets all angsty in his teenage years

00:20:20.319 --> 00:20:22.519
and runs off with her or something?

00:20:25.319 --> 00:20:26.839
Go talk some sense into him, quick!

00:20:26.839 --> 00:20:28.519
What am I supposed to say to him?

00:20:28.519 --> 00:20:29.039
You.

00:20:30.160 --> 00:20:31.640
Anything related to Weiguo

00:20:31.640 --> 00:20:32.720
has to come from you.

00:20:32.720 --> 00:20:35.039
Think about it, what would you even say?

00:20:35.720 --> 00:20:36.720
Hurry up.

00:20:42.000 --> 00:20:43.319
Have a sip too.

00:20:43.960 --> 00:20:46.519
Just think, if you were his age and this happened,

00:20:46.519 --> 00:20:48.839
you... you... you know, you...

00:20:48.839 --> 00:20:49.799
Don't let anything happen.

00:20:49.799 --> 00:20:51.200
I know, I know, I know.

00:21:11.000 --> 00:21:12.119
Studying?

00:21:18.119 --> 00:21:18.880
Um...

00:21:29.559 --> 00:21:30.839
Well...

00:21:31.400 --> 00:21:32.519
You and that Tongtong...

00:21:32.519 --> 00:21:33.240
Third Uncle.

00:21:37.279 --> 00:21:39.400
No, no, your Third Uncle is fine.

00:21:39.680 --> 00:21:40.599
Don't you worry.

00:21:40.640 --> 00:21:41.759
You... you just...

00:21:41.759 --> 00:21:43.359
Don't... don't worry about that.

00:21:49.039 --> 00:21:49.720
Dad.

00:21:51.799 --> 00:21:53.039
I've made a decision.

00:21:54.200 --> 00:21:55.160
I was thinking

00:21:55.640 --> 00:21:57.359
I should discuss it with you and Mom.

00:22:02.799 --> 00:22:03.720
Jing'er.

00:22:04.079 --> 00:22:05.359
Come here, come here.

00:22:11.240 --> 00:22:12.440
Wh-what's wrong?

00:22:12.440 --> 00:22:14.119
Come, come, sit here, sit here.

00:22:14.640 --> 00:22:15.599
Well...

00:22:16.839 --> 00:22:18.799
The kid says he's made a decision.

00:22:22.000 --> 00:22:22.759
What?

00:22:23.640 --> 00:22:24.559
This...

00:22:25.799 --> 00:22:26.640
You tell us.

00:22:30.079 --> 00:22:31.880
Wh-what happened?

00:22:34.839 --> 00:22:36.240
You, you, you, tell us.

00:22:36.240 --> 00:22:37.640
What... what have you decided to do?

00:22:39.720 --> 00:22:41.200
I want to apply to medical school.

00:22:44.319 --> 00:22:45.240
You kid, I'm telling you...

00:22:45.240 --> 00:22:46.400
I thought you were going to do something else!

00:22:46.400 --> 00:22:48.039
Like running away or something!

00:22:48.039 --> 00:22:48.799
All that nonsense!

00:22:48.799 --> 00:22:50.359
How could that be?

00:22:50.359 --> 00:22:51.839
You want to go to medical school?

00:22:51.839 --> 00:22:54.119
Your dad and I fully support you!

00:22:54.200 --> 00:22:55.720
What were you thinking, huh?

00:22:55.720 --> 00:22:57.359
Didn't you say before

00:22:58.279 --> 00:22:59.720
you wanted me to go to college?

00:23:00.400 --> 00:23:01.920
I never really figured out before

00:23:01.920 --> 00:23:03.759
what the point of me going to college was.

00:23:04.799 --> 00:23:06.039
Now I've found it.

00:23:09.720 --> 00:23:10.799
I also know

00:23:10.839 --> 00:23:12.279
studying medicine is really hard.

00:23:13.319 --> 00:23:16.640
But I think doctors can save a lot of people.

00:23:19.079 --> 00:23:21.200
Like people like Third Uncle.

00:23:28.720 --> 00:23:30.119
You focus on your studies.

00:23:30.119 --> 00:23:32.799
Don't worry about your Third Uncle's business, okay?

00:23:36.799 --> 00:23:38.279
I've been researching all day today

00:23:39.119 --> 00:23:40.200
about Third Uncle's condition.

00:23:40.200 --> 00:23:41.559
I've gotten a rough understanding.

00:23:41.720 --> 00:23:42.720
Third Uncle's illness,

00:23:42.799 --> 00:23:44.480
if he has surgery now,

00:23:44.480 --> 00:23:45.960
the risk is very high.

00:23:52.720 --> 00:23:55.119
Then don't think about this anymore.

00:23:55.839 --> 00:23:57.000
Just do your studying.

00:23:58.240 --> 00:23:58.839
Dad.

00:23:59.920 --> 00:24:01.279
You don't need to be anxious either.

00:24:02.480 --> 00:24:04.400
In the end, whether to have this surgery

00:24:05.160 --> 00:24:07.559
should be left for Third Uncle to decide himself.

00:24:54.839 --> 00:24:55.599
Come in.

00:24:58.319 --> 00:24:59.039
Doctor.

00:24:59.039 --> 00:25:01.400
Um, we're Ma Weiguo's family.

00:25:01.400 --> 00:25:02.880
Don't all come in at once.

00:25:02.880 --> 00:25:04.240
Just one person should come in.

00:25:05.680 --> 00:25:07.440
Right, okay, you all go out.

00:25:07.680 --> 00:25:08.440
Alright.

00:25:15.680 --> 00:25:16.279
Doctor.

00:25:16.279 --> 00:25:16.960
Please, have a seat.

00:25:26.119 --> 00:25:28.640
What's Ma Weiguo's current condition?

00:25:29.400 --> 00:25:30.799
The situation isn't very optimistic.

00:25:31.000 --> 00:25:32.039
As for surgery,

00:25:32.039 --> 00:25:33.200
the risk would be very high.

00:25:33.839 --> 00:25:35.160
If we go with conservative treatment,

00:25:35.319 --> 00:25:36.680
three to six months.

00:25:54.480 --> 00:25:55.279
Thanks.

00:25:57.200 --> 00:25:57.920
How are you, Big Bro?

00:25:57.920 --> 00:25:58.680
How is it?

00:25:59.200 --> 00:25:59.920
Not bad.

00:26:00.119 --> 00:26:01.640
What do you mean, "not bad"?

00:26:02.119 --> 00:26:04.680
It means my body's doing okay overall.

00:26:04.680 --> 00:26:05.480
There's still hope.

00:26:06.640 --> 00:26:07.400
Did you record it?

00:26:07.400 --> 00:26:08.119
Let's hear it.

00:26:08.680 --> 00:26:09.119
No.

00:26:09.119 --> 00:26:11.920
The doctor saw my phone when I went in, so I couldn't record.

00:26:12.119 --> 00:26:14.400
You should've just kept it in your pocket and recorded secretly. You...

00:26:14.400 --> 00:26:15.119
Exactly.

00:26:15.119 --> 00:26:15.839
Alright, here's the plan.

00:26:15.839 --> 00:26:19.039
Let's first get Weiguo discharged from the hospital.

00:26:26.559 --> 00:26:27.319
Let's go.

00:26:29.200 --> 00:26:29.759
Go.

00:26:31.160 --> 00:26:31.720
Go.

00:26:39.799 --> 00:26:40.920
No, no, no.

00:26:40.920 --> 00:26:41.880
You all go back.

00:26:41.880 --> 00:26:42.640
Get in bed and rest.

00:26:42.640 --> 00:26:43.359
Lie down for a bit, just lie down.

00:26:43.359 --> 00:26:43.920
The room is so small.

00:26:43.920 --> 00:26:44.799
What are so many people doing here?

00:26:44.799 --> 00:26:45.519
Come on, come on.

00:26:46.079 --> 00:26:46.759
No need.

00:26:46.880 --> 00:26:47.440
Lie down.

00:26:47.440 --> 00:26:48.079
Take off your shoes.

00:26:49.079 --> 00:26:50.200
Alright, alright, alright.

00:26:50.200 --> 00:26:51.160
Go back, go back, go back.

00:26:51.279 --> 00:26:52.000
Big Bro.

00:26:53.079 --> 00:26:54.640
Stop hovering around me, okay?

00:26:54.640 --> 00:26:55.920
Go do whatever you need to do.

00:26:55.920 --> 00:26:56.400
Alright.

00:26:56.400 --> 00:26:57.680
Aren't you all usually very busy?

00:26:57.680 --> 00:26:58.359
Not busy.

00:26:58.359 --> 00:27:00.319
No, I mean, what do you want to eat?

00:27:00.359 --> 00:27:01.880
I can't eat, I just got out of the hospital.

00:27:02.279 --> 00:27:03.559
I'll make you a bowl of zhajiang noodles.

00:27:03.680 --> 00:27:04.359
No need.

00:27:04.680 --> 00:27:05.799
We just want to keep you company a bit longer.

00:27:05.799 --> 00:27:06.359
No, no.

00:27:06.359 --> 00:27:07.640
Just go back, okay?

00:27:08.480 --> 00:27:10.160
Let him rest alone.

00:27:10.799 --> 00:27:11.920
Let's go, come on, let's go.

00:27:11.920 --> 00:27:14.160
But I think, you know, that thing...

00:27:14.680 --> 00:27:16.319
About your hand, the surgery thing.

00:27:16.319 --> 00:27:17.799
No, alright, alright, you're starting again...

00:27:17.799 --> 00:27:18.799
What are you doing?

00:27:19.599 --> 00:27:21.359
Big Bro, you all go ahead.

00:27:21.359 --> 00:27:22.480
I'll chat with him a bit more.

00:27:23.680 --> 00:27:24.160
Alright then.

00:27:24.160 --> 00:27:25.920
Don't stay too long.

00:27:26.160 --> 00:27:27.039
Don't worry.

00:27:27.359 --> 00:27:28.200
Go, go, go.

00:27:41.920 --> 00:27:43.480
No, I mean, you should go back.

00:27:45.599 --> 00:27:46.759
Bro, I... I...

00:27:46.759 --> 00:27:47.799
No, you've been busy all this time, you should go back.

00:27:47.799 --> 00:27:48.480
I know, Bro.

00:27:48.480 --> 00:27:50.160
I think we need to talk him into it.

00:27:50.160 --> 00:27:51.920
Get him to have the surgery soon.

00:27:52.519 --> 00:27:53.640
No, "talk him into it"...

00:27:54.599 --> 00:27:55.640
How do we do that?

00:27:57.759 --> 00:27:59.759
No, let him process it himself first.

00:27:59.759 --> 00:28:00.279
Process it?

00:28:00.279 --> 00:28:01.920
How long does he need to process it?

00:28:02.160 --> 00:28:03.960
Do you think he's a bit scared?

00:28:04.200 --> 00:28:05.000
Thinking the worst.

00:28:05.000 --> 00:28:05.720
We have to persuade him.

00:28:05.720 --> 00:28:07.160
How to think positively?

00:28:07.160 --> 00:28:09.079
Aren't you the one thinking the worst?

00:28:09.079 --> 00:28:09.920
No, I'm not.

00:28:09.920 --> 00:28:10.920
Didn't I just...

00:28:10.920 --> 00:28:11.480
I said...

00:28:11.480 --> 00:28:13.920
The doctor said his physical condition is quite good now.

00:28:13.920 --> 00:28:14.599
Right?

00:28:14.720 --> 00:28:15.480
Really?

00:28:17.759 --> 00:28:19.039
No, look at you.

00:28:19.200 --> 00:28:21.000
You're about to be a father.

00:28:21.000 --> 00:28:22.759
Don't be on the verge of tears all the time, okay?

00:28:22.759 --> 00:28:23.720
I'm not, really.

00:28:24.920 --> 00:28:26.200
I'll talk to him later.

00:28:26.200 --> 00:28:27.279
I'll take you with me.

00:28:27.279 --> 00:28:28.319
Feel better now?

00:28:30.279 --> 00:28:30.960
Yeah.

00:28:31.319 --> 00:28:32.279
Alright, hurry up and go back.

00:28:32.279 --> 00:28:33.279
Go back, okay? I'm leaving.

00:28:33.279 --> 00:28:33.839
Okay.

00:28:33.839 --> 00:28:34.759
Then you...

00:28:49.559 --> 00:28:50.599
Stop pouring water.

00:28:50.920 --> 00:28:51.839
I have a terminal illness.

00:28:51.839 --> 00:28:52.920
It's not like I'm paralyzed.

00:28:59.359 --> 00:29:00.119
Here.

00:29:01.359 --> 00:29:02.920
Just stay put quietly.

00:29:08.640 --> 00:29:09.880
Come to think of it...

00:29:10.400 --> 00:29:11.680
I'm actually quite lucky.

00:29:12.359 --> 00:29:13.920
What I have isn't the kind...

00:29:13.920 --> 00:29:15.720
...that leaves you bedridden, unable to do anything.

00:29:15.799 --> 00:29:17.680
Nor is it the kind where you drool when you talk...

00:29:17.680 --> 00:29:19.720
...and need help with every basic bodily function.

00:29:20.680 --> 00:29:22.160
If it really were like that...

00:29:22.920 --> 00:29:24.160
I'd rather kick the bucket sooner.

00:29:25.039 --> 00:29:26.039
Don't you worry.

00:29:26.039 --> 00:29:27.119
As for you...

00:29:27.480 --> 00:29:28.720
If it really comes to that day...

00:29:28.720 --> 00:29:29.799
No one will be there to take care of you.

00:29:31.839 --> 00:29:33.039
Because of your situation...

00:29:33.039 --> 00:29:34.680
I almost got a beating from Big Bro.

00:29:34.720 --> 00:29:35.720
So, what do you have to say for yourself?

00:29:36.400 --> 00:29:37.599
Then you should've fought him.

00:29:37.839 --> 00:29:39.119
Aren't you supposed to be tough?

00:29:39.160 --> 00:29:40.279
Didn't you almost fight that guy...

00:29:40.279 --> 00:29:42.319
...what's his name, Manager Luo, for Qianqian?

00:29:42.319 --> 00:29:43.039
Wasn't that you?

00:29:43.359 --> 00:29:45.279
Seems like you're not sick enough.

00:29:45.480 --> 00:29:47.240
Still have time to worry about other people's business.

00:29:48.160 --> 00:29:49.480
I'll say it again.

00:29:50.240 --> 00:29:51.599
I respect your choice.

00:29:52.359 --> 00:29:53.480
If you've made your decision...

00:29:53.480 --> 00:29:54.519
...then don't regret it.

00:29:57.400 --> 00:29:58.559
You all take care of yourselves.

00:29:59.599 --> 00:30:01.160
Of course we'll be fine.

00:30:03.160 --> 00:30:04.480
Everyone's so busy.

00:30:04.799 --> 00:30:06.039
No matter how big a deal it is...

00:30:06.480 --> 00:30:08.119
...it won't be long before it's forgotten.

00:30:09.720 --> 00:30:11.680
Besides, Penglexuan is getting better and better.

00:30:11.720 --> 00:30:13.119
In the future, when we make a fortune...

00:30:13.119 --> 00:30:14.359
...eating, drinking, and having fun every day...

00:30:14.839 --> 00:30:15.960
...we'll be living even better lives.

00:30:16.599 --> 00:30:18.359
Who'll have time to worry about your problems?

00:30:31.519 --> 00:30:33.119
Hello? What's up?

00:30:33.920 --> 00:30:34.599
What?

00:30:35.119 --> 00:30:36.279
Yuanyuan still wants to emigrate.

00:30:36.640 --> 00:30:37.799
What nonsense is this?

00:30:38.160 --> 00:30:39.599
Wait there, I'm coming right over.

00:30:43.680 --> 00:30:44.480
Go ahead.

00:30:45.279 --> 00:30:46.839
I'm not dying anytime soon.

00:31:05.759 --> 00:31:07.279
I thought I had it figured out.

00:31:07.359 --> 00:31:08.240
But I don't.

00:31:09.119 --> 00:31:10.640
I thought they would understand me.

00:31:11.000 --> 00:31:11.759
They don't.

00:31:12.640 --> 00:31:13.960
I thought I understood them.

00:31:14.279 --> 00:31:15.279
I still don't.

00:31:16.799 --> 00:31:17.599
And also...

00:31:18.160 --> 00:31:19.599
...what counts as living in misery?

00:31:20.079 --> 00:31:21.640
What counts as dying meaningfully?

00:31:22.200 --> 00:31:23.680
Have I really figured it out?

00:31:33.000 --> 00:31:33.759
Mr. Chen

00:31:34.279 --> 00:31:35.640
I don't know why

00:31:35.759 --> 00:31:37.519
but you seem very familiar to me.

00:31:38.960 --> 00:31:40.160
Xiao Tong, right?

00:31:40.160 --> 00:31:41.640
You're quite good at breaking the ice.

00:31:42.599 --> 00:31:44.039
Tens of millions of years ago,

00:31:44.039 --> 00:31:45.400
we were all relatives.

00:31:47.279 --> 00:31:48.160
Well,

00:31:48.160 --> 00:31:50.920
I worked at my previous bank for fourteen years.

00:31:51.039 --> 00:31:52.720
I'm familiar with all the operations,

00:31:52.720 --> 00:31:54.680
and I've built up a solid client base.

00:31:56.359 --> 00:31:59.519
Since you were so stable at your last job,

00:31:59.960 --> 00:32:01.519
why the sudden desire to leave?

00:32:01.720 --> 00:32:02.519
I've been there too long.

00:32:02.519 --> 00:32:03.720
I just wanted a change of scenery.

00:32:03.720 --> 00:32:04.960
And I came here seeking

00:32:04.960 --> 00:32:06.519
greater opportunities for growth.

00:32:07.039 --> 00:32:08.039
I see.

00:32:09.519 --> 00:32:10.319
I'm sorry,

00:32:10.319 --> 00:32:13.640
but we currently have no openings at your level.

00:32:14.319 --> 00:32:15.279
That's okay.

00:32:15.279 --> 00:32:17.359
I can start from an entry-level position.

00:32:18.839 --> 00:32:20.319
After the background check results come in,

00:32:20.319 --> 00:32:21.519
we'll contact you again.

00:32:24.359 --> 00:32:26.400
A background check is mandatory?

00:32:26.720 --> 00:32:28.319
It's a required procedure.

00:32:28.599 --> 00:32:29.720
Is there a problem?

00:32:29.759 --> 00:32:31.279
No, no, no.

00:32:35.759 --> 00:32:36.680
Thank you.

00:32:43.839 --> 00:32:45.839
Yuanyuan said herself last time she didn't want to emigrate.

00:32:45.839 --> 00:32:47.000
She wanted to spend more time with me.

00:32:47.400 --> 00:32:49.079
Didn't Kevin hear it too?

00:32:49.079 --> 00:32:50.079
You think Yuanyuan is like you?

00:32:50.079 --> 00:32:51.160
Changing your mind on a whim?

00:32:51.400 --> 00:32:53.079
Why are you shouting so loud?

00:32:53.640 --> 00:32:55.640
I need you to keep your emotions in check, okay?

00:32:56.000 --> 00:32:57.480
You're scaring my daughter.

00:32:58.839 --> 00:32:59.720
Jenny.

00:33:00.440 --> 00:33:01.759
Tell Daddy yourself.

00:33:05.519 --> 00:33:06.240
Yuanyuan.

00:33:06.640 --> 00:33:07.400
Daddy's here.

00:33:07.400 --> 00:33:08.559
You don't need to be afraid.

00:33:08.640 --> 00:33:10.240
Just say what you're thinking.

00:33:11.559 --> 00:33:13.160
Say what's on your mind.

00:33:15.359 --> 00:33:17.759
Daddy, I'm sorry.

00:33:17.880 --> 00:33:19.559
I thought about it again,

00:33:20.119 --> 00:33:23.279
and what Mom and Uncle Kevin said makes more sense.

00:33:26.079 --> 00:33:28.279
Going abroad earlier is better for me.

00:33:28.680 --> 00:33:30.559
I also want to meet some

00:33:30.559 --> 00:33:32.079
friends over there sooner.

00:33:37.200 --> 00:33:38.559
Did you hear that clearly?

00:33:42.319 --> 00:33:43.599
Weren't you the one who said

00:33:43.599 --> 00:33:45.160
we should respect the child's wishes?

00:33:46.000 --> 00:33:47.480
Just sign the consent form already.

00:35:46.199 --> 00:35:47.480
The situation isn't very optimistic.

00:35:47.800 --> 00:35:48.800
If we operate,

00:35:48.800 --> 00:35:50.280
the risks would be very high.

00:35:50.599 --> 00:35:51.920
With conservative treatment,

00:35:52.159 --> 00:35:53.360
three to six months.

00:36:16.480 --> 00:36:17.119
Big Bro.

00:36:19.079 --> 00:36:19.920
Let's go play ball.

00:36:21.719 --> 00:36:22.559
Come on.

00:36:22.679 --> 00:36:23.400
Big Bro.

00:36:27.519 --> 00:36:28.480
Hurry up.

00:36:29.559 --> 00:36:30.280
Let's go.

00:37:35.480 --> 00:37:37.400
I'm his big brother.

00:37:38.239 --> 00:37:40.960
But I can't do anything.

00:37:58.719 --> 00:38:00.880
I heard everything you said to Feifei that day.

00:38:01.559 --> 00:38:02.920
I was listening.

00:38:06.440 --> 00:38:08.440
You still remember that incident so clearly.

00:38:10.079 --> 00:38:11.280
How could I forget?

00:38:20.719 --> 00:38:21.719
From now on,

00:38:22.480 --> 00:38:25.559
we gotta live like we did back in the day.

00:38:33.079 --> 00:38:34.440
Since Weiguo came back,

00:38:35.519 --> 00:38:37.519
so many things have really changed.

00:38:39.320 --> 00:38:41.639
I thought life would just stay the same,

00:38:43.599 --> 00:38:46.039
never expected it could bloom in so many ways.

00:38:46.480 --> 00:38:47.880
Everything's truly different now.

00:38:50.719 --> 00:38:52.039
Now, I

00:38:54.760 --> 00:38:57.880
can understand his state of mind a little better.

00:38:58.800 --> 00:39:01.079
When a person reaches the end,

00:39:01.880 --> 00:39:05.159
who doesn't want to live with dignity?

00:39:08.360 --> 00:39:09.960
So I won't pressure him either.

00:39:13.480 --> 00:39:14.960
He came back this time

00:39:16.440 --> 00:39:19.480
just wanting to live a relaxed,

00:39:20.480 --> 00:39:21.960
ordinary life.

00:39:25.000 --> 00:39:25.880
But,

00:39:32.199 --> 00:39:33.480
we'll just stay by his side,

00:39:34.400 --> 00:39:36.360
and cherish the time he has left.

00:39:38.360 --> 00:39:39.360
Together.

00:40:15.599 --> 00:40:16.280
Third Uncle.

00:40:20.000 --> 00:40:21.199
You finally agreed to see me.

00:40:23.360 --> 00:40:24.719
Are you feeling better?

00:40:25.519 --> 00:40:26.639
Better than ever.

00:40:27.239 --> 00:40:28.039
That's good.

00:40:29.599 --> 00:40:30.760
Just get plenty of rest.

00:40:30.760 --> 00:40:32.760
I should go, I have school.

00:40:32.760 --> 00:40:33.840
I just wanted to check on you.

00:40:34.280 --> 00:40:35.039
Feifei.

00:40:37.079 --> 00:40:38.000
You're braver than I am.

00:40:39.760 --> 00:40:41.159
Sit down and chat with me for a bit.

00:40:43.039 --> 00:40:43.679
Okay.

00:40:49.880 --> 00:40:51.840
And you don't need to feel awkward.

00:40:51.960 --> 00:40:52.840
It's nothing.

00:40:53.760 --> 00:40:56.360
People, no matter their age,

00:40:56.360 --> 00:40:57.519
have emotions and desires.

00:40:57.519 --> 00:40:58.480
That's perfectly normal.

00:40:59.880 --> 00:41:00.880
Moreover,

00:41:01.880 --> 00:41:03.480
and Third Uncle really admires you.

00:41:04.119 --> 00:41:05.119
You're very brave.

00:41:05.760 --> 00:41:06.960
When you like someone,

00:41:06.960 --> 00:41:08.159
at least you dare to say it.

00:41:08.880 --> 00:41:10.119
As for me, I...

00:41:11.480 --> 00:41:13.119
No, Uncle.

00:41:13.280 --> 00:41:14.880
Can we not talk about this?

00:41:15.119 --> 00:41:16.199
I *want* to talk about this.

00:41:19.840 --> 00:41:20.519
Feifei.

00:41:21.360 --> 00:41:22.239
Remember this.

00:41:22.960 --> 00:41:24.000
In the future,

00:41:24.199 --> 00:41:26.119
you'll encounter all sorts of things.

00:41:26.760 --> 00:41:27.760
No matter what,

00:41:28.119 --> 00:41:29.280
you must stay brave.

00:41:29.639 --> 00:41:30.280
Understand?

00:41:30.760 --> 00:41:31.280
Okay.

00:41:35.599 --> 00:41:36.400
And what about you?

00:41:38.719 --> 00:41:40.199
Will you become brave too?
