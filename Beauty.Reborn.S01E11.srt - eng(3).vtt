WEBVTT

00:01:40.440 --> 00:01:41.920
Did she say she loves Din?

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:45.200
She didn't answer. But even
if she did, she wouldn't pick me.

00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:48.400
I already checked. Our cream
doesn't cause reactions.

00:01:48.480 --> 00:01:49.880
Someone is sabotaging us.

00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:52.680
I want to thank you for your help.

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:56.120
If it weren't for you guys,
we'd be in deep trouble for a long time.

00:01:56.200 --> 00:01:57.800
I can pressure Din

00:01:57.880 --> 00:01:59.800
to step down as CEO.

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:01.760
Work properly.

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:04.240
Don't screw me over again.

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:05.400
-My sister too.
-Yo!

00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:07.440
You traitor!

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:10.560
You think I didn't see that? Your eyes
practically swallowed Sarach whole.

00:02:10.639 --> 00:02:12.720
Are you overthinking?

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:17.320
Then swear you don't have
a crush on Sarach.

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:20.960
If you feel anything more
than friendship for Sarach,

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:22.800
may he hate you forever.

00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:32.280
I knew you wouldn't dare swear.
You like Sarach.

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:36.560
Why would I? What are you saying?

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:40.520
We're close
just because our siblings are married.

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:42.240
That's all.

00:02:42.320 --> 00:02:44.200
Then swear.

00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:50.680
I swear I don't have a crush on Sarach.

00:02:51.520 --> 00:02:55.040
If I do, may he hate me for life.

00:02:57.560 --> 00:02:59.040
Hear that?

00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:08.280
I hear it.

00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:52.920
Hello, Mr. Praphop.

00:03:53.520 --> 00:03:54.520
Please follow me.

00:04:02.280 --> 00:04:04.280
If things go on like this,
we're definitely losing our jobs.

00:04:05.040 --> 00:04:08.800
Seeing how Ms. Namnuan is acting,
it's obvious who the new CEO will be.

00:04:28.120 --> 00:04:29.400
Sorry to keep you waiting.

00:04:30.240 --> 00:04:31.680
First of all,

00:04:31.760 --> 00:04:34.400
regarding the drama
over the cream scandal,

00:04:34.480 --> 00:04:36.440
I've already dealt with the matter

00:04:36.520 --> 00:04:37.880
concerning those hired attacks

00:04:37.960 --> 00:04:40.560
that used false information
to discredit the company.

00:04:42.480 --> 00:04:45.480
But the production stoppage

00:04:46.120 --> 00:04:48.000
nearly caused the company to lose money

00:04:48.720 --> 00:04:50.560
and resulted in no dividends
for another year.

00:04:52.320 --> 00:04:54.640
So, I'll take responsibility for this

00:04:56.080 --> 00:04:57.400
by resigning.

00:05:03.360 --> 00:05:07.600
Look, I admire the work
Mr. Pathawee has done up until now,

00:05:08.520 --> 00:05:10.080
but at this moment,

00:05:10.160 --> 00:05:12.960
PD needs a change,

00:05:13.040 --> 00:05:15.440
so we can move forward.

00:05:17.080 --> 00:05:19.280
In my view,

00:05:19.360 --> 00:05:20.960
the person best suited

00:05:21.760 --> 00:05:25.120
to lead us through this crisis

00:05:25.200 --> 00:05:27.400
as the new CEO…

00:05:31.360 --> 00:05:32.800
is Mr. Chakrit.

00:05:39.560 --> 00:05:41.160
It's a great honor, sir.

00:05:42.880 --> 00:05:46.440
I promise I will work tirelessly

00:05:46.520 --> 00:05:51.880
for the company and for everything
that Mr. Pathawee has built.

00:05:53.160 --> 00:05:54.720
Thank you for your commitment.

00:05:55.400 --> 00:05:58.920
But I believe there is still
another CEO candidate

00:05:59.960 --> 00:06:01.440
who is the right person

00:06:01.520 --> 00:06:04.920
to protect everything I've built.

00:06:06.960 --> 00:06:09.000
Who else could possibly do that?

00:06:15.040 --> 00:06:16.200
It's me.

00:06:19.480 --> 00:06:20.680
Nam?

00:06:30.960 --> 00:06:32.120
I'd like to propose

00:06:32.760 --> 00:06:36.160
a suitable candidate for PD Company.

00:06:36.240 --> 00:06:38.800
And I'd like to use all my shares

00:06:39.640 --> 00:06:41.760
to support Mr. Apo as the next CEO.

00:06:42.600 --> 00:06:44.120
I believe

00:06:44.200 --> 00:06:47.320
the majority of shareholders
will agree with this.

00:06:48.040 --> 00:06:49.240
Nam.

00:06:49.320 --> 00:06:51.520
Why did you do this
without speaking to me first?

00:07:01.960 --> 00:07:03.480
So, why did you come see me?

00:07:11.240 --> 00:07:13.080
I want you to take over as CEO for me.

00:07:14.240 --> 00:07:16.280
Right now, no one
is more suitable than you.

00:07:18.400 --> 00:07:21.200
You know I don't like
getting involved in company affairs,

00:07:21.280 --> 00:07:23.240
especially the politics there.

00:07:23.320 --> 00:07:25.120
I helped you plenty last time.

00:07:25.200 --> 00:07:26.440
That should be enough, right?

00:07:27.520 --> 00:07:29.520
This isn't just about helping me
or the company.

00:07:30.440 --> 00:07:31.920
It's for your own good too.

00:07:33.320 --> 00:07:34.680
You might not care

00:07:34.760 --> 00:07:36.040
if the company gets sold,

00:07:36.720 --> 00:07:38.960
but having it taken away
right in front of you,

00:07:39.040 --> 00:07:40.280
that's different.

00:07:41.960 --> 00:07:44.120
You can just give up
and do nothing if you want.

00:07:44.760 --> 00:07:46.040
But are you sure

00:07:47.200 --> 00:07:49.080
you won't regret it later?

00:07:53.160 --> 00:07:54.600
Since Mr. Pathawee

00:07:55.440 --> 00:07:57.160
has made this proposal,

00:07:57.800 --> 00:07:58.920
that's fine by me.

00:07:59.640 --> 00:08:02.880
Competition is always good
for the company, after all.

00:08:03.480 --> 00:08:06.000
But still, I'd like to request some time

00:08:06.080 --> 00:08:08.200
for all the shareholders

00:08:08.280 --> 00:08:11.560
to carefully consider their options.

00:08:11.640 --> 00:08:13.320
Therefore,

00:08:14.160 --> 00:08:16.600
I move to recess the meeting briefly.

00:08:31.880 --> 00:08:34.600
Always causing trouble.
This completely messed up the plan.

00:08:35.880 --> 00:08:37.840
You need to do something.

00:08:37.919 --> 00:08:41.360
Those two combined definitely
hold more shares than we do.

00:08:41.440 --> 00:08:44.360
If the shareholders side with Din,

00:08:44.440 --> 00:08:46.240
we're going to be at a disadvantage.

00:08:47.280 --> 00:08:49.400
If we want to win, we need Yo's shares.

00:08:50.320 --> 00:08:53.960
But I didn't have him sign
a power of attorney. So how can we vote?

00:08:55.440 --> 00:08:58.120
Then Wayo has to come here himself.

00:08:58.200 --> 00:09:00.400
Here. Right now.

00:09:23.640 --> 00:09:27.280
Yo, get to the company right now.
I need your help with something important.

00:09:28.360 --> 00:09:30.080
He's probably in class right now.

00:09:31.760 --> 00:09:33.160
He won't be able to come, Mom.

00:09:42.960 --> 00:09:44.040
Thanks, Din.

00:09:45.360 --> 00:09:48.400
You being this nice to me
gives me chills, you know.

00:09:50.320 --> 00:09:51.920
Mom is going to call you today.

00:09:53.240 --> 00:09:55.360
Give me your phone.

00:09:56.440 --> 00:09:57.680
I'll handle whatever comes up.

00:09:59.520 --> 00:10:00.960
As for you,

00:10:02.480 --> 00:10:05.480
take this phone for now,
in case you need to call anyone.

00:10:11.280 --> 00:10:13.560
I knew you'd try something like this.

00:10:13.640 --> 00:10:16.360
There's no way you'd ever take my side.

00:10:17.040 --> 00:10:20.280
If you know that, then give up already.
Why keep being so stubborn?

00:10:20.360 --> 00:10:22.200
You're just wasting your time and energy.

00:10:22.280 --> 00:10:23.920
Things were going great.

00:10:24.880 --> 00:10:26.520
But you threw in the towel

00:10:26.600 --> 00:10:28.880
and sold your shares, just like that.

00:10:29.640 --> 00:10:30.520
Why?

00:10:31.080 --> 00:10:34.200
Are you so afraid of losing your comfort
that you'll betray your own family?

00:10:34.280 --> 00:10:35.400
Din!

00:10:36.040 --> 00:10:40.040
Listen to yourself. You've been
around your wife too much.

00:10:40.120 --> 00:10:41.680
At least when I fall,

00:10:43.240 --> 00:10:46.280
Sara is the one who stays by my side.

00:10:54.280 --> 00:10:56.160
I'm actually using Din's phone right now.

00:10:57.160 --> 00:10:59.080
I'll tell him when I see him.

00:11:01.360 --> 00:11:02.440
Gotta go.

00:11:05.880 --> 00:11:07.000
Sarach.

00:11:12.320 --> 00:11:14.080
I didn't mean what I said back then.

00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:18.160
It has nothing to do with me anyway.
Don't worry about it.

00:11:18.760 --> 00:11:19.680
"Don't worry"?

00:11:20.600 --> 00:11:23.040
You tell someone not to worry
and then try to walk away?

00:11:24.200 --> 00:11:26.360
-Aren't we friends?
-We are not friends.

00:11:27.200 --> 00:11:28.840
We just go to the same school.

00:11:29.720 --> 00:11:31.520
We've known each other since we were kids.

00:11:33.880 --> 00:11:35.240
You're the rich kid,

00:11:36.080 --> 00:11:37.520
and I'm the gardener's kid.

00:11:38.240 --> 00:11:39.880
We've always been on different levels.

00:11:53.080 --> 00:11:54.560
Based on the vote,

00:11:55.160 --> 00:11:59.560
the next CEO of PD will be…

00:12:03.880 --> 00:12:05.440
Mr. Apo.

00:12:15.840 --> 00:12:17.280
Congratulations.

00:12:20.600 --> 00:12:21.640
Thank you.

00:12:49.280 --> 00:12:52.200
Where have you been, and what
did you do to get this worked up?

00:12:53.040 --> 00:12:54.280
It's PD Company.

00:12:55.200 --> 00:12:58.120
That damn Din pulled a move
and had Nam voted as CEO instead of me.

00:12:59.040 --> 00:13:01.280
Nam? CEO?

00:13:01.360 --> 00:13:02.960
I bet you never imagined

00:13:03.040 --> 00:13:06.320
someone like Nam would have
the brains to be CEO too, did you?

00:13:07.480 --> 00:13:09.520
When is that Din ever going to drop dead?

00:13:09.600 --> 00:13:11.000
He's so irritating.

00:13:12.240 --> 00:13:14.040
You lost. Just let it go.

00:13:14.120 --> 00:13:17.080
How many years have you
lived like this? Just end it.

00:13:17.800 --> 00:13:20.160
No. It's not over.

00:13:23.680 --> 00:13:26.240
I'll never lose
to those Phimarndech people,

00:13:26.800 --> 00:13:28.360
no matter what it takes.

00:13:29.800 --> 00:13:32.480
So, you let Mr. Praphop
beat you up just for that?

00:13:36.920 --> 00:13:39.600
Even if he killed me, I'd still do it.

00:13:41.080 --> 00:13:43.280
As long as those Phimarndech people

00:13:43.360 --> 00:13:44.640
are completely destroyed.

00:14:23.320 --> 00:14:25.560
TO BAICHA: WHERE ARE YOU? LET'S STREAM
ALREADY SET UP THE CAFE

00:14:25.640 --> 00:14:27.360
CLOSED IT FOR YOU. WHERE ARE YOU?

00:14:27.440 --> 00:14:30.240
WHY AREN'T YOU COMING TO THE CAFE?
ARE YOU NOT EVEN GONNA REPLY?

00:14:31.000 --> 00:14:33.200
Are you not even gonna reply?

00:15:10.000 --> 00:15:11.960
Watch out for Krit.

00:15:12.040 --> 00:15:14.560
He won't let your family off easily.

00:15:19.640 --> 00:15:21.200
NAM

00:15:35.280 --> 00:15:36.560
POWER OFF

00:16:08.520 --> 00:16:09.480
Hey.

00:16:09.560 --> 00:16:11.960
Get up already. It's ten o'clock.

00:16:12.600 --> 00:16:14.680
I haven't slept through the night
like this in years.

00:16:14.760 --> 00:16:16.400
Let me sleep a bit more.

00:16:19.520 --> 00:16:21.040
If you want to rest, go ahead.

00:16:21.640 --> 00:16:24.920
I'm going to get
something to eat. I'm starving.

00:16:28.600 --> 00:16:29.560
Okay, I'm up.

00:16:31.760 --> 00:16:35.200
You can go back to sleep
if you want. I can just order food.

00:16:35.800 --> 00:16:37.760
-You're sulking?
-I'm not.

00:16:37.840 --> 00:16:39.040
I'm not an idiot.

00:16:39.840 --> 00:16:40.720
Should we go out?

00:16:45.920 --> 00:16:46.880
Where?

00:16:55.240 --> 00:16:56.520
Have you ever wondered

00:16:56.600 --> 00:16:59.480
why "Tokyo Pancakes" in Thailand
aren't actually from Tokyo?

00:17:00.440 --> 00:17:04.359
I'm more curious why you haven't
eaten yet, so we can go make merit.

00:17:09.000 --> 00:17:09.960
Well.

00:17:11.200 --> 00:17:12.520
Satisfied now?

00:17:13.920 --> 00:17:17.079
You look cute
when your cheeks puff up like that.

00:17:27.359 --> 00:17:29.280
You look cute

00:17:29.360 --> 00:17:31.800
when your cheeks puff up too.

00:17:35.840 --> 00:17:38.240
Hey, put your left hand up like this.

00:17:41.480 --> 00:17:42.960
And hold it out like this.

00:17:47.360 --> 00:17:48.680
Let's go make merit.

00:17:50.680 --> 00:17:51.840
So smooth, huh?

00:18:14.400 --> 00:18:16.360
Go. Fly away.

00:18:22.760 --> 00:18:24.720
What did you wish for?

00:18:25.720 --> 00:18:27.680
To be rich, obviously.

00:18:29.360 --> 00:18:31.480
Even though my company
isn't giving dividends,

00:18:31.560 --> 00:18:34.480
the inheritance
my father left me is a lot.

00:18:34.560 --> 00:18:36.360
I can take care of you comfortably.

00:18:37.880 --> 00:18:41.640
No thanks. My philosophy
is that good money

00:18:41.720 --> 00:18:44.160
should always come from your own pocket.

00:18:45.520 --> 00:18:46.360
So stingy.

00:18:51.320 --> 00:18:52.760
What about you?

00:18:53.840 --> 00:18:55.120
What did you wish for?

00:19:03.400 --> 00:19:04.600
Huh?

00:19:04.680 --> 00:19:07.640
You won't tell me your wish?
That's cheating.

00:19:12.600 --> 00:19:13.880
I'll take you again sometime.

00:19:15.000 --> 00:19:17.360
-Sure.
-I just found out you like making merit.

00:19:17.960 --> 00:19:20.560
After messing people around,
you two are all lovey-dovey, huh?

00:19:22.200 --> 00:19:24.320
You made Mr. Praphop yell at me.

00:19:24.920 --> 00:19:28.600
What's going to happen
to our debts now? Did you even think?

00:19:30.840 --> 00:19:33.560
Din's always wrong in your eyes, Auntie.

00:19:34.160 --> 00:19:35.120
You always blame him.

00:19:35.200 --> 00:19:37.720
Has he ever done anything
worth praising in your eyes?

00:19:37.800 --> 00:19:39.120
Nothing.

00:19:40.120 --> 00:19:41.800
Everything he tries fails.

00:19:41.880 --> 00:19:43.920
What am I supposed to be proud of?

00:19:44.680 --> 00:19:46.720
The only failure he has ever faced

00:19:46.800 --> 00:19:48.160
is losing his mother

00:19:48.240 --> 00:19:50.920
and having to grow up
with a stepmother who never valued him.

00:19:52.800 --> 00:19:55.320
-That's enough.
-How can that be enough?

00:19:56.440 --> 00:19:58.920
I've had to watch him
get treated like this so many times.

00:19:59.000 --> 00:20:00.440
Nothing he does is ever good enough.

00:20:00.520 --> 00:20:02.360
You use him like he's a servant.

00:20:03.120 --> 00:20:04.080
But with your own sons,

00:20:04.160 --> 00:20:06.880
have you ever ordered
them around like that?

00:20:06.960 --> 00:20:08.760
You just let him handle everything.

00:20:09.840 --> 00:20:13.320
Of course. He's not your biological son.
Why would you care?

00:20:14.360 --> 00:20:15.320
You brat!

00:20:15.920 --> 00:20:18.200
Let's go. Come on.

00:20:18.720 --> 00:20:20.400
No matter how awful she is,
she's still my mother.

00:20:20.480 --> 00:20:22.360
We still have to live under the same roof.

00:20:23.240 --> 00:20:26.240
Are you just going to tolerate someone
who disrespects you like that?

00:20:27.400 --> 00:20:29.400
Why respect people who leech off others?

00:20:30.440 --> 00:20:32.360
When they're in trouble,
they run to us for help.

00:20:33.280 --> 00:20:35.360
Your father behaved like a beggar.

00:20:36.680 --> 00:20:37.920
That's a bit much, Mom.

00:20:39.320 --> 00:20:41.560
At least Uncle Suthee didn't betray Dad

00:20:41.640 --> 00:20:43.400
like you did by selling your shares.

00:20:44.240 --> 00:20:47.520
And now I've already quit as CEO for you.
What more do you want?

00:20:49.120 --> 00:20:51.400
Then why did you drag my son into this?!

00:20:52.880 --> 00:20:55.120
I want you out of our lives.

00:20:55.680 --> 00:20:58.080
Stop having any sibling relationship
with my sons.

00:20:59.840 --> 00:21:03.120
I've had to swallow a lot
from your father's womanizing.

00:21:03.840 --> 00:21:06.040
I had to raise you,
the child of another woman.

00:21:06.560 --> 00:21:08.400
Put up with your mother squeezing money.

00:21:09.240 --> 00:21:11.840
What do you think
I've gone through all these years?!

00:21:13.080 --> 00:21:16.160
My mother's already dead.
How could she be squeezing you for money?!

00:21:18.280 --> 00:21:19.240
Your mother? Dead?

00:21:20.800 --> 00:21:22.400
She actually left you!

00:21:23.800 --> 00:21:28.280
She slept with your father to have you,
then dumped you for money.

00:21:28.360 --> 00:21:31.080
And she hasn't stopped
extorting us even now.

00:21:31.160 --> 00:21:33.480
You only work this hard
to pay me and your brothers back.

00:21:33.560 --> 00:21:35.960
Do you realize how lucky you are?!

00:22:18.880 --> 00:22:20.000
Din.

00:22:25.200 --> 00:22:27.120
Mr. Din, please stop.

00:22:27.200 --> 00:22:30.240
Please stop.
Don't let yourself get hurt like this.

00:23:01.640 --> 00:23:02.760
When I was a kid…

00:23:06.240 --> 00:23:08.280
I tried to get good grades.

00:23:10.120 --> 00:23:11.240
When I started working,

00:23:12.240 --> 00:23:14.040
I did my very best.

00:23:14.880 --> 00:23:16.440
Because I hoped my father and mother…

00:23:18.880 --> 00:23:19.880
No.

00:23:22.640 --> 00:23:24.400
Actually, just my mother.

00:23:26.680 --> 00:23:28.520
Because I already knew my father loved me.

00:23:30.680 --> 00:23:31.720
But…

00:23:41.680 --> 00:23:42.840
It's okay.

00:23:46.640 --> 00:23:47.640
I know.

00:23:51.240 --> 00:23:52.640
I know Mom never loved me.

00:23:57.200 --> 00:23:58.840
No matter what I did,

00:24:00.440 --> 00:24:02.240
Mom only ever loved Nam and Yo.

00:24:09.160 --> 00:24:11.000
I accepted that a long time ago

00:24:13.760 --> 00:24:14.880
because I knew

00:24:15.680 --> 00:24:17.080
I still had Dad.

00:24:19.280 --> 00:24:21.880
When Dad entrusted the company
to me before he died,

00:24:22.920 --> 00:24:24.280
I did everything,

00:24:26.080 --> 00:24:28.120
no matter how much I hated it.

00:24:33.360 --> 00:24:34.520
But I was wrong.

00:24:36.920 --> 00:24:39.280
It might not be what you think.

00:24:43.000 --> 00:24:44.720
What else could it be?

00:24:47.320 --> 00:24:48.880
Dad lied to me all this time.

00:24:49.840 --> 00:24:53.040
He said my real mother
was dead, when, in fact,

00:24:53.120 --> 00:24:54.360
she's still alive.

00:24:57.080 --> 00:25:00.200
How am I supposed to see it any other way?

00:25:02.240 --> 00:25:04.040
There may be only one truth,

00:25:05.480 --> 00:25:07.960
but there can be many contexts to it.

00:25:10.880 --> 00:25:12.040
I think…

00:25:14.320 --> 00:25:17.080
I know someone who understands
this better than we do.

00:25:18.800 --> 00:25:21.160
We should hear him out first.

00:25:23.000 --> 00:25:24.080
Who is it?

00:25:36.480 --> 00:25:38.360
Ms. Namnuan wasn't lying.

00:25:39.400 --> 00:25:42.040
She just exaggerated a bit, that's all.

00:25:45.720 --> 00:25:47.720
Is it true my mother abandoned me…

00:25:49.360 --> 00:25:50.680
for money?

00:25:57.200 --> 00:25:58.680
I wouldn't call it "abandoning."

00:25:59.560 --> 00:26:00.760
I'd say

00:26:01.640 --> 00:26:03.240
she let you live with someone

00:26:03.320 --> 00:26:05.560
who was ready to raise you.
That's more accurate.

00:26:07.520 --> 00:26:09.440
As for whether it was for money,

00:26:11.040 --> 00:26:13.400
Tesho and Krongthong were legally married.

00:26:14.200 --> 00:26:15.520
When they divorced,

00:26:16.200 --> 00:26:19.000
Krongthong was entitled to marital assets

00:26:19.080 --> 00:26:20.640
and alimony.

00:26:21.560 --> 00:26:24.800
And I think that's perfectly normal.

00:26:29.640 --> 00:26:31.120
If it was normal,

00:26:32.200 --> 00:26:35.720
then why lie and say
Din's mother was dead?

00:26:41.320 --> 00:26:42.240
Dad.

00:26:43.160 --> 00:26:44.680
Please just tell me the whole story.

00:26:46.360 --> 00:26:48.080
It means so much to me.

00:26:51.000 --> 00:26:52.880
They didn't love each other.

00:26:53.960 --> 00:26:56.600
Krongthong was a model who worked with PD.

00:26:57.840 --> 00:26:59.920
When Tesho was young,
he was quite the womanizer.

00:27:01.680 --> 00:27:04.520
Once she got pregnant, they had to marry.

00:27:07.880 --> 00:27:09.320
But they didn't love each other.

00:27:10.240 --> 00:27:12.880
Tesho tried his best to make it work,

00:27:14.560 --> 00:27:16.080
but they couldn't stay together.

00:27:16.160 --> 00:27:17.360
WEDDING INVITATION

00:27:17.440 --> 00:27:18.560
So they divorced.

00:27:18.640 --> 00:27:19.720
DIVORCE CERTIFICATE

00:27:28.200 --> 00:27:30.000
Did they hate each other so much

00:27:30.800 --> 00:27:32.560
that he had to lie and say she was dead?

00:27:36.720 --> 00:27:38.280
That's personal.

00:27:38.800 --> 00:27:40.480
I don't know the whole story.

00:27:41.520 --> 00:27:42.760
About the lie,

00:27:43.560 --> 00:27:45.640
Tesho probably had his reasons.

00:27:47.680 --> 00:27:49.680
Reasons to make me grateful,

00:27:50.360 --> 00:27:51.960
to serve Ms. Namnuan and my brothers?

00:27:52.800 --> 00:27:54.040
Mr. Din.

00:27:55.920 --> 00:27:57.440
I really can't see it any other way.

00:27:58.600 --> 00:28:01.080
Even setting aside the part
about her leaving me for money,

00:28:02.120 --> 00:28:03.360
the fact that he lied

00:28:04.280 --> 00:28:05.600
hurts even more,

00:28:06.120 --> 00:28:07.760
because I loved him the most.

00:28:12.040 --> 00:28:13.000
Dad.

00:28:14.720 --> 00:28:16.240
Do you know where my mother is?

00:28:17.840 --> 00:28:19.480
I'd really like to meet her just once.

00:28:23.680 --> 00:28:24.920
I honestly don't know.

00:28:55.960 --> 00:28:56.960
Mr. Din?

00:28:58.680 --> 00:29:01.560
Hello, Mr. Din. How can I help you?

00:29:02.120 --> 00:29:03.240
Uncle Perm.

00:29:04.160 --> 00:29:06.760
Do you know anyone named Krongthong?

00:29:11.520 --> 00:29:12.560
Uncle Perm?

00:29:13.200 --> 00:29:14.200
Uh…

00:29:14.960 --> 00:29:16.360
Which Krongthong exactly?

00:29:18.400 --> 00:29:19.600
My mother, Uncle.

00:29:21.840 --> 00:29:23.320
That silence means you knew.

00:29:27.400 --> 00:29:28.920
I'm sorry, Mr. Din.

00:29:29.720 --> 00:29:33.200
No need to apologize.
You were following Dad's orders.

00:29:35.120 --> 00:29:36.120
Uncle Perm.

00:29:37.080 --> 00:29:38.600
I want to meet my mother just once.

00:29:39.440 --> 00:29:40.880
Do you know where she is?

00:29:42.680 --> 00:29:46.640
I don't know exactly,
but I can probably track her down.

00:29:47.320 --> 00:29:49.720
In that case, I'll leave it
to you. Thank you.

00:29:57.120 --> 00:29:58.800
So, why did you tell Din?

00:30:00.080 --> 00:30:01.120
Just to spite him.

00:30:01.200 --> 00:30:05.080
He likes standing in my way so much,
and then he has the nerve to lecture me?

00:30:05.160 --> 00:30:06.480
He deserved it.

00:30:07.720 --> 00:30:09.600
Wasn't that a little cruel, Mom?

00:30:10.360 --> 00:30:13.360
You already secretly
sold shares once before.

00:30:13.440 --> 00:30:14.880
Zip it.

00:30:15.560 --> 00:30:19.000
You and he ganged up on me
and made my side lose, and I got blamed.

00:30:19.080 --> 00:30:20.760
I didn't say a word about that.

00:30:21.440 --> 00:30:23.200
But this is different, Mom.

00:30:23.800 --> 00:30:27.400
I am your mother.
If I say it's the same, it is.

00:30:31.360 --> 00:30:32.320
Right.

00:30:53.800 --> 00:30:55.040
Hello, Uncle Perm.

00:30:55.640 --> 00:30:57.600
I've found Ms. Krongthong's address.

00:30:58.160 --> 00:30:59.400
I'll send you the location.

00:31:00.240 --> 00:31:02.240
Really, Uncle? That was fast.

00:31:02.960 --> 00:31:05.320
I've run errands for Mr. Tesho

00:31:05.400 --> 00:31:07.600
about Ms. Krongthong many times.

00:31:07.680 --> 00:31:09.520
So, I had contacts I could reach out to.

00:31:11.080 --> 00:31:13.520
But… Mr. Din.

00:31:14.440 --> 00:31:15.520
What is it?

00:31:16.080 --> 00:31:18.080
You should prepare yourself a little.

00:31:19.280 --> 00:31:20.200
Why?

00:31:23.240 --> 00:31:26.640
You'll see when you meet her.

00:31:29.560 --> 00:31:30.880
Thank you, Uncle.

00:31:33.320 --> 00:31:34.800
Is something wrong?

00:32:09.080 --> 00:32:10.640
If you're not ready,

00:32:12.040 --> 00:32:14.200
we can come back another day.

00:32:19.680 --> 00:32:20.840
It's okay.

00:32:22.160 --> 00:32:23.200
I want to meet her.

00:32:39.800 --> 00:32:40.840
Alright.

00:32:42.760 --> 00:32:44.120
Wait.

00:32:44.200 --> 00:32:46.560
I said no garnish.
Did you even listen, Auntie?

00:32:46.640 --> 00:32:48.560
Oh, I forgot.

00:32:48.640 --> 00:32:50.880
Just eat it! Stop being difficult.

00:32:52.520 --> 00:32:55.560
Hey, are my noodles ready?
I need to eat today!

00:32:55.640 --> 00:32:57.680
Why are you rushing me?

00:32:57.760 --> 00:33:00.480
Hang on! I'm working by myself here!

00:33:04.280 --> 00:33:06.800
-Hey, Auntie!
-What?

00:33:06.880 --> 00:33:08.840
Should I collect today's interest
along with yesterday's?

00:33:09.480 --> 00:33:10.880
I don't have it. Just go home.

00:33:10.960 --> 00:33:14.080
Hey. You said the same thing yesterday.
You think this is a joke?

00:33:14.160 --> 00:33:17.360
Look, all I've got
is noodle broth. You want it?!

00:33:17.440 --> 00:33:19.560
Just go home for now.
I'll give it to you tomorrow.

00:33:20.160 --> 00:33:22.880
If I can't sell anything,
none of you get anything!

00:33:22.960 --> 00:33:24.960
Remember,

00:33:25.040 --> 00:33:27.280
if I don't get my money tomorrow,
I'll trash your shop!

00:33:27.360 --> 00:33:28.720
Go! Get out of here!

00:33:28.800 --> 00:33:30.000
Hey!

00:33:30.080 --> 00:33:32.720
-Let's go.
-You guys want some noodle broth?

00:33:35.600 --> 00:33:36.640
Let's go.

00:33:38.880 --> 00:33:41.240
What the hell is wrong with these people?

00:33:42.680 --> 00:33:43.920
Are you going in?

00:34:32.480 --> 00:34:33.639
PLEASE DON'T BE SAD…

00:34:45.199 --> 00:34:47.040
Please don't be sad.

00:34:47.120 --> 00:34:51.480
Everyone has problems in life.

00:34:52.080 --> 00:34:53.920
Just look beside you,

00:34:54.560 --> 00:34:57.240
and you'll always see
people who stand by you.

00:34:58.240 --> 00:34:59.840
I'm here for you.

00:35:00.480 --> 00:35:01.800
P.S.

00:35:02.480 --> 00:35:04.840
If you're stressed,
add a little sweetness to your life.

00:35:10.760 --> 00:35:12.320
Aren't you ever going to change the trick?

00:35:13.040 --> 00:35:15.560
It works. Why change it?

00:35:17.200 --> 00:35:18.560
I'm not a kid anymore, you know.

00:35:19.160 --> 00:35:22.000
How did you know
a lollipop would cheer me up?

00:35:23.160 --> 00:35:24.360
Then give it back.

00:35:25.680 --> 00:35:26.840
No way.

00:35:26.920 --> 00:35:28.520
-Give it here.
-No.

00:35:29.160 --> 00:35:31.040
Give it back right now. Come here!

00:35:31.120 --> 00:35:32.240
Thank you.

00:35:50.800 --> 00:35:53.080
I really meant what I wrote, you know.

00:35:54.040 --> 00:35:55.680
I don't want you to forget

00:35:56.960 --> 00:35:59.400
-that beside you, you always have--
-You?

00:36:02.640 --> 00:36:04.360
It's not just me, though.

00:36:04.920 --> 00:36:07.560
You still have Mr. Nam, Mr. Wayo,

00:36:07.640 --> 00:36:10.240
Uncle Permboon,

00:36:10.320 --> 00:36:11.760
and so many others.

00:36:13.280 --> 00:36:14.640
But the most important person…

00:36:16.360 --> 00:36:17.360
is you.

00:36:26.440 --> 00:36:27.360
Are you blushing?

00:36:30.080 --> 00:36:31.200
No.

00:36:31.720 --> 00:36:33.040
I don't get shy over this.

00:36:34.880 --> 00:36:36.280
Okay, I believe you.

00:36:37.320 --> 00:36:39.520
Then I'll kiss your hand again,
since you're not shy.

00:36:40.040 --> 00:36:42.000
Hey! That's enough.

00:36:46.320 --> 00:36:47.520
Let's go on a trip tomorrow.

00:36:48.840 --> 00:36:51.320
What's this?
Suddenly inviting me on a trip?

00:36:51.400 --> 00:36:52.560
Don't you want to go?

00:36:56.800 --> 00:36:58.160
DAD SUTHEE

00:37:03.520 --> 00:37:04.560
Your dad.

00:37:09.360 --> 00:37:10.480
Yes, Dad?

00:37:11.080 --> 00:37:15.240
At first, I wasn't sure if I should call
and tell you this, Din.

00:37:15.920 --> 00:37:19.800
But I didn't want you
to misunderstand your father

00:37:20.400 --> 00:37:21.840
any further.

00:37:23.640 --> 00:37:24.600
What do you mean?

00:37:26.160 --> 00:37:27.960
Tesho didn't mean to lie to you.

00:37:28.960 --> 00:37:30.520
He just didn't want you to be sad,

00:37:31.240 --> 00:37:33.320
so he told you your mother was gone.

00:37:34.160 --> 00:37:35.240
Because…

00:37:37.640 --> 00:37:39.440
your mother didn't want you to be born.

00:37:40.360 --> 00:37:41.800
She intended to have an abortion.

00:37:45.960 --> 00:37:46.920
Wh--

00:37:48.200 --> 00:37:52.440
Why did my mother want to abort me?

00:37:57.920 --> 00:38:00.520
Krongthong was a famous
rising model back then.

00:38:01.640 --> 00:38:04.160
She thought that if she had
to carry a baby for nine months,

00:38:05.160 --> 00:38:07.840
she wouldn't have gotten another chance
to be that famous again.

00:38:07.920 --> 00:38:09.560
Krong!

00:38:09.640 --> 00:38:10.920
Are you crazy?

00:38:11.000 --> 00:38:12.640
That's your child.

00:38:12.720 --> 00:38:14.240
Don't you feel any love at all?

00:38:14.320 --> 00:38:16.120
I didn't want it to be born!

00:38:16.200 --> 00:38:19.000
Who knew it would happen
after doing it just once?

00:38:19.680 --> 00:38:22.400
There's no way
I'd let you get an abortion.

00:38:23.080 --> 00:38:24.560
Even if you don't want it,

00:38:24.640 --> 00:38:26.400
it's my child.

00:38:27.120 --> 00:38:29.120
So, how are you going to compensate me?!

00:38:29.200 --> 00:38:30.960
My career is booming!

00:38:31.040 --> 00:38:34.480
You expect me to ruin my future
for a kid I never wanted?!

00:38:37.840 --> 00:38:38.880
Krong!

00:38:41.600 --> 00:38:44.280
Your father begged her to keep you.

00:38:45.880 --> 00:38:48.680
He could have hidden it
and arranged an abortion

00:38:49.280 --> 00:38:51.240
without worrying about any other expenses,

00:38:51.840 --> 00:38:53.040
but he didn't let her.

00:38:54.480 --> 00:38:56.680
On top of that,
he legally married Krongthong

00:38:56.760 --> 00:38:58.120
just to reassure her.

00:38:59.280 --> 00:39:00.440
Like I said,

00:39:01.200 --> 00:39:03.280
they just couldn't make it work.

00:39:03.360 --> 00:39:05.520
Your mother went through money like crazy.

00:39:09.000 --> 00:39:11.280
What were you spending
hundreds of thousands a month on?!

00:39:11.880 --> 00:39:13.800
Are you trying to bankrupt me?

00:39:14.400 --> 00:39:17.120
You own a cosmetics factory!

00:39:17.200 --> 00:39:18.760
What's the big deal?!

00:39:19.640 --> 00:39:23.200
No matter how rich I get, it won't
be enough if you keep spending like this.

00:39:23.280 --> 00:39:26.240
How about this?
I'll give you 50,000 a month,

00:39:26.320 --> 00:39:27.880
and that's it. Deal?

00:39:28.480 --> 00:39:31.960
Are you crazy?! You tricked me

00:39:32.040 --> 00:39:34.680
into carrying your baby,
and now you treat me like this?

00:39:34.760 --> 00:39:36.400
You promised me everything!

00:39:36.480 --> 00:39:37.800
I'm only spending this much…

00:39:37.880 --> 00:39:41.040
No matter how rich Tesho was,
he wasn't printing his own money.

00:39:41.800 --> 00:39:44.520
And PD wasn't this big back then.

00:39:45.440 --> 00:39:47.680
So, they eventually had to get divorced.

00:40:14.040 --> 00:40:16.240
Why are you brushing me off like this?

00:40:16.320 --> 00:40:17.960
I only agreed to be CEO

00:40:18.040 --> 00:40:19.720
because I thought you'd back me up.

00:40:19.800 --> 00:40:23.400
Did you see? Krit nearly carved me up
in the middle of the meeting.

00:40:23.480 --> 00:40:26.720
I'm sorry. I've just have a lot
on my mind right now.

00:40:27.280 --> 00:40:30.520
There's one more thing
I need to talk to you about.

00:40:31.120 --> 00:40:32.320
What is it?

00:40:32.400 --> 00:40:35.840
So what if you don't have me?
You still have Ms. Sarah.

00:40:36.440 --> 00:40:38.600
I'm pregnant, Din.

00:40:38.680 --> 00:40:40.400
What should I do?

00:41:26.520 --> 00:41:28.040
