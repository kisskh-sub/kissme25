00:01:15.319 --> 00:01:16.480
Mom

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:17.719
What are you doing here?

00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:20.040
I came to see you.

00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:21.920
How long has it been since you came home?

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:24.680
Where have you been so late at night?

00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:25.760
Coming back this late.

00:01:26.319 --> 00:01:27.280
I should have known better than to...

00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:28.680
...let you move out on your own.

00:01:29.760 --> 00:01:30.959
Secretary Lin and I...

00:01:31.159 --> 00:01:32.280
...just got back from working overtime.

00:01:32.799 --> 00:01:34.200
He's seeing me home, isn't he?

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:34.560
Yes. (Support Admin Watch on
kissasia.cam or kisskh.org)

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:36.719
The company's new product launch has been keeping us very busy.

00:01:37.159 --> 00:01:38.040
Mom, you...

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:39.480
...have seen me now.

00:01:39.480 --> 00:01:41.719
Maybe you should head out first.

00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:42.719
Leave? What for?

00:01:42.719 --> 00:01:43.840
I finally made it here.

00:01:44.719 --> 00:01:45.120
Mom.

00:01:45.120 --> 00:01:45.959
It's getting late.

00:01:45.959 --> 00:01:46.799
Dad will be worried.

00:01:46.799 --> 00:01:48.040
You should get some rest, okay?

00:01:48.040 --> 00:01:48.840
I'll see you out.

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:49.319
No, I mean...

00:01:49.319 --> 00:01:50.000
I'll call a car for you.

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:50.239
Let's go.

00:01:50.239 --> 00:01:51.239
I just got here.

00:01:51.239 --> 00:01:51.680
Let's go, let's go.

00:01:52.319 --> 00:01:52.920
Wait, wait, wait.

00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:57.120
Why isn't Secretary Lin leaving?

00:01:58.760 --> 00:01:59.599
The two of us...

00:01:59.599 --> 00:02:00.840
...still have some things to go over.

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:01.799
So...

00:02:01.799 --> 00:02:02.840
Mom, how about...

00:02:04.519 --> 00:02:05.719
I call you a car?

00:02:06.359 --> 00:02:07.760
Don't rush me.

00:02:07.959 --> 00:02:09.479
I haven't even gotten to the main point.

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:10.639
Sit down, sit down, quickly.

00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:12.639
What can't wait until tomorrow?

00:02:13.039 --> 00:02:13.560
Listen to me.

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:14.919
There's a very important matter.

00:02:15.479 --> 00:02:16.680
I'm telling you.

00:02:17.479 --> 00:02:18.520
Next week...

00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:19.599
...I've arranged for you...

00:02:19.599 --> 00:02:20.919
...twelve blind dates.

00:02:21.919 --> 00:02:22.719
Blind dates?

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:25.479
Yes.

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:26.919
What are the specifics?

00:02:26.919 --> 00:02:27.840
It's like this.

00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:29.840
Monday, ten AM.

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:31.439
Height: 188 cm.

00:02:31.439 --> 00:02:32.400
A P.E. teacher.

00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:33.719
Hobby: fitness.

00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:35.560
Six-pack abs.

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:38.360
Monday, two PM.

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:40.439
A partner lawyer at a top-tier law firm.

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:41.759
Hobby: music.

00:02:41.919 --> 00:02:43.120
Piano grade eight.

00:02:44.159 --> 00:02:46.000
Thursday, eleven PM.

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:47.560
A software engineer.

00:02:47.879 --> 00:02:48.520
This guy...

00:02:48.520 --> 00:02:49.879
...is a bit light on hair.

00:02:49.919 --> 00:02:51.360
But he's highly intelligent!

00:02:51.719 --> 00:02:53.919
We have to think about the next generation's IQ.

00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:57.120
Friday, three AM.

00:02:57.840 --> 00:02:58.400
What time?

00:02:58.759 --> 00:03:00.120
Three in the morning.

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:02.759
A blind date at three in the morning?

00:03:02.759 --> 00:03:03.199
Mom.

00:03:03.520 --> 00:03:04.520
Are you okay?

00:03:05.080 --> 00:03:07.199
He's a doctor in the ICU.

00:03:07.199 --> 00:03:08.000
His work is extremely busy.

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:09.520
I had a hard time getting this slot.

00:03:09.800 --> 00:03:10.759
Listen to me.

00:03:11.039 --> 00:03:12.879
This time, you better perk up.

00:03:13.080 --> 00:03:13.879
Do you hear me?

00:03:14.759 --> 00:03:15.840
Before you turn thirty...

00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:17.960
...I must get you a boyfriend.

00:03:18.199 --> 00:03:19.319
You're not worried at all.

00:03:19.319 --> 00:03:21.039
Your dad and I are worried sick.

00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:24.199
Trust in Mom's rigorous selection.

00:03:24.360 --> 00:03:26.039
There's bound to be one that suits you.

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:29.439
Secretary Lin, take this.

00:03:29.439 --> 00:03:31.080
You're in charge of supervising her then.

00:03:35.159 --> 00:03:35.520
Mom.

00:03:35.520 --> 00:03:35.919
Um...

00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:36.680
Auntie.

00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:38.520
Actually...

00:03:39.639 --> 00:03:40.599
Meili and I...

00:03:40.599 --> 00:03:41.800
...are already together.

00:03:42.759 --> 00:03:43.759
Together doing what?

00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:45.840
We're together.

00:03:46.800 --> 00:03:47.960
Together doing what, exactly?

00:03:47.960 --> 00:03:49.280
It means the two of us...

00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:50.840
...are together.

00:03:53.039 --> 00:03:53.800
Yes.

00:04:02.520 --> 00:04:03.800
You learned this from TV, didn't you?

00:04:04.560 --> 00:04:06.520
Hiring Secretary Lin at a high salary...

00:04:06.520 --> 00:04:08.120
...to play your boyfriend.

00:04:08.520 --> 00:04:10.000
Who are you trying to fool here?

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:11.479
We really are together.

00:04:11.479 --> 00:04:11.960
I'm telling you.

00:04:11.960 --> 00:04:13.280
Don't mess around with me here.

00:04:14.120 --> 00:04:14.520
No.

00:04:14.800 --> 00:04:15.400
Auntie.

00:04:15.840 --> 00:04:16.639
Meili and I...

00:04:16.959 --> 00:04:17.680
...really...

00:04:17.680 --> 00:04:19.160
...are really dating.

00:04:19.560 --> 00:04:21.120
I told you, we're really together.

00:04:21.120 --> 00:04:22.560
Why don't you believe me?

00:04:22.879 --> 00:04:24.079
Didn't you and Dad both hope...

00:04:24.079 --> 00:04:25.720
...that Secretary Lin and I would get together?

00:04:25.879 --> 00:04:26.920
So now that we're together...

00:04:26.920 --> 00:04:28.160
...shouldn't you be happy?

00:04:28.160 --> 00:04:28.800
Why don't you believe it?

00:04:28.800 --> 00:04:30.000
Why don't you believe me?

00:04:31.120 --> 00:04:31.920
It's not that.

00:04:33.920 --> 00:04:34.279
You...

00:04:34.279 --> 00:04:34.720
...you two...

00:04:34.879 --> 00:04:37.199
...don't look like you're dating at all.

00:04:37.879 --> 00:04:39.399
What doesn't look like it?

00:04:42.040 --> 00:04:43.120
When people date...

00:04:43.120 --> 00:04:44.079
...at the very least...

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:47.480
...they hold hands or something, right?

00:04:55.519 --> 00:04:57.759
There should be a hug or something too.

00:05:02.560 --> 00:05:03.839
And a kiss.

00:05:06.160 --> 00:05:06.839
Is that enough, Mom?

00:05:06.839 --> 00:05:08.000
What else do you want to see?

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:09.040
See what?

00:05:09.120 --> 00:05:10.079
There's nothing else.

00:05:10.240 --> 00:05:11.279
Mom, listen to me.

00:05:11.360 --> 00:05:12.120
Go home, quickly.

00:05:12.120 --> 00:05:13.399
You still haven't left.

00:05:13.399 --> 00:05:14.240
What time is it already, Mom?

00:05:14.720 --> 00:05:16.279
Don't interrupt our burning desire.

00:05:16.279 --> 00:05:17.040
Fiery trees and silver flowers.

00:05:17.040 --> 00:05:18.199
Beautiful flowers and full moon.

00:05:18.360 --> 00:05:18.759
Round...

00:05:20.319 --> 00:05:20.920
...round...

00:05:21.240 --> 00:05:22.240
...consummation.

00:05:22.639 --> 00:05:23.240
Mom!

00:05:24.160 --> 00:05:24.480
Go!

00:05:24.480 --> 00:05:25.279
Go quickly!

00:05:27.040 --> 00:05:27.920
Bye, Mom!

00:05:28.360 --> 00:05:29.240
Bye-bye.

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:36.800
Meili.

00:05:38.759 --> 00:05:41.800
Was everything you just said true?

00:05:58.399 --> 00:06:01.000
That's way too short.

00:06:02.120 --> 00:06:03.199
Yeah.

00:06:03.199 --> 00:06:05.839
And it went by so fast.

00:06:08.439 --> 00:06:09.879
Why?

00:06:11.439 --> 00:06:13.639
Two people who didn't even have a wedding when they got married...

00:06:13.759 --> 00:06:15.759
...why would they have one for their remarriage?

00:06:17.319 --> 00:06:18.600
Because this time, we want...

00:06:19.240 --> 00:06:20.519
...to have Doufu with us.

00:06:21.600 --> 00:06:23.160
Having Doufu is enough.

00:06:23.160 --> 00:06:24.759
Why come to us?

00:06:25.199 --> 00:06:27.759
You sure know how to pick your moment.

00:06:30.560 --> 00:06:32.120
Because my darling said...

00:06:32.439 --> 00:06:33.399
...this matter...

00:06:33.720 --> 00:06:35.160
...must be discussed with Miss Qin...

00:06:35.160 --> 00:06:36.279
...in person.

00:06:36.439 --> 00:06:37.720
So I came with her.

00:06:38.959 --> 00:06:40.639
But, bro, I didn't know you were here.

00:06:40.639 --> 00:06:41.639
I swear.

00:06:42.480 --> 00:06:43.439
What are you talking about?

00:06:43.600 --> 00:06:45.000
Isn't it better with friends around?

00:06:45.480 --> 00:06:46.279
Hey, Qin Meili.

00:06:46.439 --> 00:06:47.439
I don't care.

00:06:47.560 --> 00:06:48.279
On the second day of next month...

00:06:48.279 --> 00:06:49.480
...you must be my bridesmaid.

00:06:49.800 --> 00:06:50.600
Exactly.

00:06:50.720 --> 00:06:51.639
Because you two...

00:06:52.040 --> 00:06:54.639
...are witnesses to our rekindled love.

00:06:54.800 --> 00:06:56.560
We need you to witness our...

00:06:56.759 --> 00:06:58.240
...sacred moment.

00:06:58.800 --> 00:06:59.600
I refuse.

00:06:59.680 --> 00:07:00.519
I refuse too.

00:07:02.040 --> 00:07:02.839
Hanzi.

00:07:03.199 --> 00:07:05.120
We've been brothers for so many years.

00:07:05.399 --> 00:07:06.920
You have to help me.

00:07:08.120 --> 00:07:09.199
If you help me...

00:07:09.560 --> 00:07:10.720
...next time you look for a girlfriend...

00:07:10.920 --> 00:07:11.639
I will definitely...

00:07:14.079 --> 00:07:14.639
Uh...

00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:15.759
Misunderstanding!

00:07:16.040 --> 00:07:17.240
That's not what I meant!

00:07:17.240 --> 00:07:18.319
Forget it, I'm done.

00:07:18.319 --> 00:07:19.319
I'm going back to sleep.

00:07:19.319 --> 00:07:20.600
I'm dead tired.

00:07:20.600 --> 00:07:21.120
Qin Meili!

00:07:21.120 --> 00:07:22.160
You haven't agreed yet!

00:07:22.160 --> 00:07:23.759
I'm going to sleep right now.

00:07:23.759 --> 00:07:24.680
Sis.

00:07:32.639 --> 00:07:33.560
What's up?

00:07:34.040 --> 00:07:34.720
We two...

00:07:35.399 --> 00:07:36.040
...true love.

00:07:36.720 --> 00:07:37.319
Get out.

00:07:37.319 --> 00:07:38.040
You get out too.

00:07:40.439 --> 00:07:40.879
Hanzi!

00:07:41.079 --> 00:07:41.680
Tell Meili...

00:07:41.680 --> 00:07:42.399
...she must come!

00:07:42.399 --> 00:07:42.959
You have to come too!

00:07:42.959 --> 00:07:43.600
Hanzi!

00:07:44.639 --> 00:07:46.120
What's the rush?

00:07:46.279 --> 00:07:47.319
What's going on?

00:07:47.439 --> 00:07:48.240
This... this...

00:07:49.680 --> 00:07:50.480
Go.

00:07:51.399 --> 00:07:52.199
Then I'll go.

00:08:03.800 --> 00:08:06.120
Turns out, who you are doesn't matter at all.

00:08:06.839 --> 00:08:08.399
Who I love is what matters most.

00:08:31.199 --> 00:08:32.000
You're not asleep.

00:10:50.320 --> 00:10:51.320
Get up and eat.

00:10:54.399 --> 00:10:55.200
Be good.

00:10:55.559 --> 00:10:56.960
You have to go to the company soon.

00:10:59.279 --> 00:11:00.080
No.

00:11:08.159 --> 00:11:08.960
Not like this either.

00:11:12.799 --> 00:11:13.799
How about like this?

00:11:17.840 --> 00:11:18.639
Alright, alright.

00:11:20.639 --> 00:11:22.440
Have you all heard the latest news?

00:11:23.279 --> 00:11:24.120
What news?

00:11:24.399 --> 00:11:25.799
President Qin is dating someone.

00:11:25.799 --> 00:11:27.000
Really? No way.

00:11:27.360 --> 00:11:28.000
It's those two.

00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:29.320
My friend ran into them.

00:11:29.639 --> 00:11:31.559
She'd seen President Qin in reports before...

00:11:31.559 --> 00:11:32.919
...so she recognized him.

00:11:33.159 --> 00:11:34.200
There's even a photo.

00:11:34.200 --> 00:11:35.200
Let me show you.

00:11:35.200 --> 00:11:36.000
Let's see, let's see.

00:11:37.039 --> 00:11:38.000
Nice figure.

00:11:38.320 --> 00:11:39.480
But there's no face.

00:11:39.480 --> 00:11:40.279
Hey, let me see.

00:11:40.759 --> 00:11:43.120
Maybe the front isn't much to look at.

00:11:44.279 --> 00:11:46.440
Our President Qin has been single since birth.

00:11:46.600 --> 00:11:47.960
She won't get scammed, will she?

00:11:48.480 --> 00:11:50.039
Even though she's a superwoman...

00:11:50.519 --> 00:11:52.519
...her dating experience is basically zero.

00:11:52.519 --> 00:11:53.120
Right.

00:11:53.120 --> 00:11:54.080
Too naive.

00:11:54.080 --> 00:11:54.639
Yeah.

00:11:54.840 --> 00:11:56.480
A woman like President Qin...

00:11:56.720 --> 00:11:57.279
...the kind she'd accept...

00:11:57.279 --> 00:11:58.879
...are definitely just toy boys after her money.

00:11:58.960 --> 00:12:00.080
What do you know?

00:12:00.080 --> 00:12:00.559
Maybe...

00:12:00.559 --> 00:12:01.480
What kind of woman?

00:12:03.879 --> 00:12:04.679
Why talk behind someone's back...

00:12:04.679 --> 00:12:05.759
...and casually judge a girl?

00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:07.120
A girl.

00:12:08.639 --> 00:12:09.639
Saying I have no face.

00:12:09.639 --> 00:12:10.480
Calling me a toy boy.

00:12:10.480 --> 00:12:11.480
I don't care about any of that.

00:12:11.679 --> 00:12:13.080
Why casually judge a...

00:12:13.080 --> 00:12:14.399
...clearly outstanding girl?

00:12:14.600 --> 00:12:15.600
How great are you yourselves?

00:12:15.600 --> 00:12:16.559
Is your work finished?

00:12:43.720 --> 00:12:44.720
You all know now.

00:12:47.720 --> 00:12:48.360
Come in.

00:12:48.919 --> 00:12:50.039
Introduce yourself.

00:12:53.279 --> 00:12:54.679
Hello everyone, my name is Li Yi.

00:12:54.720 --> 00:12:56.279
I'm very happy to become your colleague.

00:12:56.720 --> 00:12:57.279
From now on...

00:12:57.360 --> 00:12:58.440
...please take good care of me.

00:12:59.360 --> 00:13:01.360
Li Yi will be taking over Secretary Lin's duties.

00:13:01.799 --> 00:13:03.159
I hope everyone will cooperate fully.

00:13:03.720 --> 00:13:05.360
He needs to get up to speed quickly...

00:13:05.360 --> 00:13:06.480
...and meet my requirements.

00:13:06.879 --> 00:13:09.200
Especially you, Secretary Lin.

00:13:11.399 --> 00:13:12.159
Is that clear?

00:13:12.639 --> 00:13:14.919
Understood.
