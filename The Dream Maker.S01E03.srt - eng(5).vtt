Mom, Dad.

00:01:46.872 --> 00:01:50.111
Let's congratulate Tao
for getting his journalist's license

00:01:50.512 --> 00:01:52.351
and joining "New City Life".

00:01:53.712 --> 00:01:54.471
- Auntie.
- Congratulations.

00:01:54.631 --> 00:01:55.191
Tao.

00:01:55.631 --> 00:01:56.872
Relax, stay seated.

00:01:57.872 --> 00:01:58.872
Yeah, sit down.

00:01:59.751 --> 00:02:02.111
We're used to it.

00:02:02.551 --> 00:02:05.432
It's like some sort of absurd comedy.

00:02:06.191 --> 00:02:07.792
Alright, I'll sit.

00:02:10.312 --> 00:02:10.712
Cheers.

00:02:15.032 --> 00:02:15.712
Tao.

00:02:17.992 --> 00:02:20.392
Being a journalist
carries great responsibility.

00:02:20.751 --> 00:02:23.631
Writing should reflect the times.

00:02:23.951 --> 00:02:26.432
Poetry and songs
should address real events.

00:02:27.392 --> 00:02:28.592
Understand this,

00:02:28.751 --> 00:02:31.112
and you will
become an outstanding journalist.

00:02:31.832 --> 00:02:32.631
You are right.

00:02:33.671 --> 00:02:36.152
In my opinion,
being a good person comes first.

00:02:36.631 --> 00:02:39.032
Whether the writing is good
comes second.

00:02:41.631 --> 00:02:42.552
You're right, too.

00:02:44.432 --> 00:02:45.152
Actually,

00:02:45.511 --> 00:02:48.712
news is everywhere around us.

00:02:49.592 --> 00:02:52.392
It's just that
we lack the eyes to see it.

00:02:54.791 --> 00:02:55.351
Exactly.

00:02:55.832 --> 00:02:57.152
The seductive eyes

00:02:57.351 --> 00:02:58.351
certainly see a lot.

00:02:59.592 --> 00:03:00.471
What seductive eyes?

00:03:01.191 --> 00:03:02.112
Mom, Dad,

00:03:02.272 --> 00:03:03.951
let him eat his meal in peace.

00:03:15.112 --> 00:03:15.552
Hello?

00:03:16.392 --> 00:03:17.112
Is it Qiuping?

00:03:17.511 --> 00:03:18.112
Auntie?

00:03:19.791 --> 00:03:20.712
Is Tao there?

00:03:21.191 --> 00:03:21.592
Yeah.

00:03:22.832 --> 00:03:23.631
It's your mom.

00:03:24.992 --> 00:03:27.191
Tao told you
about the Grain Bureau job, right?

00:03:27.712 --> 00:03:28.791
What have you decided?

00:03:31.392 --> 00:03:32.071
Hello, Mom.

00:03:32.471 --> 00:03:34.272
Tao, what's going on?

00:03:34.911 --> 00:03:36.631
You haven't told Qiuping yet?

00:03:36.951 --> 00:03:39.071
I-I haven't had the chance to tell her.

00:03:39.592 --> 00:03:40.911
If I hadn't called to ask,

00:03:41.191 --> 00:03:42.351
you wouldn't tell her?

00:03:42.951 --> 00:03:43.791
Tell her

00:03:44.231 --> 00:03:45.671
that it's a good opportunity.

00:03:46.112 --> 00:03:47.312
I never ask for favors.

00:03:47.832 --> 00:03:48.832
But you know

00:03:49.071 --> 00:03:51.552
how much favor I asked
for this transfer order.

00:03:52.432 --> 00:03:53.992
Ask her right now.

00:03:55.552 --> 00:03:57.152
Okay, I'll ask.

00:03:59.511 --> 00:04:00.432
Mom, I asked her.

00:04:00.511 --> 00:04:02.071
She's not considering it yet.

00:04:02.191 --> 00:04:03.231
We're having food.

00:04:03.272 --> 00:04:04.231
I'll call you back.

00:04:04.471 --> 00:04:05.112
That's it, bye.

00:04:06.791 --> 00:04:07.231
Tao.

00:04:07.671 --> 00:04:08.112
Auntie.

00:04:09.312 --> 00:04:10.152
What's going on?

00:04:11.191 --> 00:04:11.951
I heard your mom.

00:04:12.712 --> 00:04:14.872
She said she asked people for favors.

00:04:15.071 --> 00:04:16.871
That means it's already settled.

00:04:18.592 --> 00:04:20.072
Qiuping, why wouldn't you go?

00:04:20.231 --> 00:04:21.072
Auntie.

00:04:21.111 --> 00:04:22.311
This isn't Qiuping's fault.

00:04:22.311 --> 00:04:23.952
I hadn't told her yet.

00:04:25.231 --> 00:04:26.192
Then go.

00:04:26.911 --> 00:04:29.632
People fight tooth and nail
to get into the Grain Bureau.

00:04:30.431 --> 00:04:31.991
It's in the provincial capital.

00:04:31.991 --> 00:04:33.671
You'll see each other more easily.

00:04:35.111 --> 00:04:35.632
Yeah,

00:04:36.192 --> 00:04:37.952
but I don't want to go there.

00:04:39.152 --> 00:04:39.911
Why not?

00:04:40.632 --> 00:04:42.752
You should go back
to the provincial capital.

00:04:42.911 --> 00:04:44.791
That's where you belong.

00:04:47.231 --> 00:04:49.111
But I want to stay in Pingchuan County.

00:04:49.952 --> 00:04:51.152
Let's talk about it

00:04:51.192 --> 00:04:52.311
after we eat.

00:04:53.351 --> 00:04:55.311
They didn't make you
the Secretary of Yuehai.

00:04:55.791 --> 00:04:57.392
Why do you want to stay in Pingchuan?

00:05:00.551 --> 00:05:01.991
Don't you know

00:05:01.991 --> 00:05:03.032
why she wants to stay?

00:05:03.632 --> 00:05:04.952
You pulled that suicide stunt.

00:05:05.111 --> 00:05:05.431
Now...

00:05:05.431 --> 00:05:06.111
Again?

00:05:06.632 --> 00:05:07.512
You drove me crazy

00:05:07.671 --> 00:05:08.991
and made me do that.

00:05:09.231 --> 00:05:10.671
Can you be reasonable for once?

00:05:11.111 --> 00:05:11.991
Make yourself clear.

00:05:12.072 --> 00:05:12.832
I'm unreasonable?

00:05:14.512 --> 00:05:15.192
Are you going to

00:05:15.272 --> 00:05:16.431
nag about it forever?

00:05:16.471 --> 00:05:16.832
Auntie.

00:05:16.911 --> 00:05:18.072
I want the best for her.

00:05:18.231 --> 00:05:19.192
Is that wrong?

00:05:19.311 --> 00:05:20.072
Auntie, Uncle.

00:05:20.072 --> 00:05:21.032
Be reasonable, okay?

00:05:21.032 --> 00:05:21.671
About what?

00:05:21.671 --> 00:05:22.551
L-Let's calm down.

00:05:22.551 --> 00:05:23.192
Eat first.

00:05:23.231 --> 00:05:24.392
What's your reasoning?

00:05:25.192 --> 00:05:26.072
She's like this.

00:05:26.272 --> 00:05:27.111
Like what?

00:05:27.311 --> 00:05:27.791
This!

00:05:28.032 --> 00:05:29.392
Listen, I just think...

00:05:29.431 --> 00:05:30.192
I think Qiuping

00:05:30.231 --> 00:05:31.431
has her own considerations.

00:05:31.632 --> 00:05:32.871
How about we eat first?

00:05:32.911 --> 00:05:33.231
Yeah.

00:05:33.272 --> 00:05:33.911
Nonsense...

00:05:34.632 --> 00:05:36.392
Mom, lend me your glasses.

00:05:38.752 --> 00:05:39.671
What are you doing?

00:05:41.712 --> 00:05:42.272
Look.

00:05:43.791 --> 00:05:45.351
If I work at the Grain Bureau,

00:05:45.712 --> 00:05:47.272
this is what I'll become.

00:05:47.911 --> 00:05:49.991
Is that what you want for me?

00:05:50.712 --> 00:05:52.152
You... Silly kid.

00:05:54.192 --> 00:05:57.032
Mom, I haven't decided outright
not to go.

00:05:57.431 --> 00:05:58.991
I just found out about this.

00:05:59.471 --> 00:05:59.871
Yeah.

00:06:00.431 --> 00:06:01.871
Let me mull it over

00:06:02.111 --> 00:06:02.991
for a while.

00:06:04.551 --> 00:06:06.231
Alright, let's keep eating.

00:06:07.272 --> 00:06:08.272
Come on.

00:06:11.231 --> 00:06:12.431
Are you taking the job?

00:06:12.911 --> 00:06:13.712
Of course not.

00:06:14.311 --> 00:06:15.111
The way I see it,

00:06:15.832 --> 00:06:18.592
grain coupons and grain shops
will be gone

00:06:19.152 --> 00:06:20.032
in a few years.

00:06:20.752 --> 00:06:23.871
The current way of life will undergo

00:06:23.952 --> 00:06:25.192
drastic changes.

00:06:25.752 --> 00:06:26.752
But if things go on,

00:06:26.791 --> 00:06:28.671
you'll be found out long before then.

00:06:28.832 --> 00:06:29.632
What will you do?

00:06:29.991 --> 00:06:32.111
I'll just say they didn't enroll me.

00:06:33.231 --> 00:06:34.671
Alright. We'll do it your way.

00:06:35.392 --> 00:06:36.111
Thank you.

00:06:39.351 --> 00:06:40.712
I need to tell you something.

00:06:41.192 --> 00:06:43.712
That newly appointed
Secretary Zheng of Yuehai

00:06:43.791 --> 00:06:44.832
contacted us and asked me

00:06:44.991 --> 00:06:46.072
to take some photos

00:06:46.111 --> 00:06:47.632
and write an article for promotion.

00:06:48.231 --> 00:06:51.111
H-Here's the introduction letter
from our editor-in-chief.

00:06:53.111 --> 00:06:55.952
Zheng Decheng
actually wrote to your office?

00:06:56.512 --> 00:06:57.272
Interesting.

00:06:58.671 --> 00:07:02.032
Our editor-in-chief only wanted me
to come take a look

00:07:02.072 --> 00:07:03.272
and take some pictures.

00:07:04.072 --> 00:07:05.351
It's nothing serious.

Get me a ladder.

00:07:27.791 --> 00:07:28.272
Got it.

00:10:07.632 --> 00:10:08.272
It's fine.

00:10:08.392 --> 00:10:08.951
Don't.

00:10:10.472 --> 00:10:11.551
I'm fine.

00:10:13.671 --> 00:10:14.791
This is all blurred now.

00:10:15.431 --> 00:10:17.112
- Meng Xiaoli.
- Meng Xiaoli.

00:10:17.112 --> 00:10:17.472
(Introduction Letter)

00:10:17.472 --> 00:10:19.551
Okay.

00:10:19.911 --> 00:10:20.632
Here. Okay.

00:10:27.591 --> 00:10:30.232
You're the village doctor, right?

00:10:30.352 --> 00:10:30.791
Yeah.

00:10:32.551 --> 00:10:34.671
Okay, come on.

00:10:37.152 --> 00:10:37.671
Welcome.

00:10:38.512 --> 00:10:39.152
Thank you, sir.

00:10:39.671 --> 00:10:40.752
- Fill in the form.
- Okay.

00:10:45.191 --> 00:10:46.711
- You alright?
- Go ahead.

00:10:49.152 --> 00:10:50.591
Nice handwriting.

00:10:51.232 --> 00:10:53.791
Take charge of registration, okay?

00:10:54.392 --> 00:10:55.272
- Alright.
- Registration.

00:10:55.352 --> 00:10:55.791
Okay.

00:10:56.752 --> 00:10:57.272
Sir.

00:10:57.752 --> 00:11:01.311
Are you the Secretary or something?

00:11:01.392 --> 00:11:02.032
Secretary?

00:11:03.752 --> 00:11:04.032
Well...

00:11:04.032 --> 00:11:05.032
I'm the... uh...

00:11:05.071 --> 00:11:06.032
- Town...
- Mayor?

00:11:06.512 --> 00:11:07.071
Town mayor?

00:11:07.152 --> 00:11:08.951
Well... you...

00:11:14.711 --> 00:11:16.512
(Lin Dongfu, you're awesome.)

00:11:17.352 --> 00:11:18.272
(Lin Dongfu.)

00:11:18.512 --> 00:11:19.272
Stay here.

00:11:19.352 --> 00:11:20.671
(Lin Dongfu, you're awesome.)

00:11:25.752 --> 00:11:27.791
(Lin Dongfu, you're awesome.)

00:11:29.752 --> 00:11:31.071
You scared me.

00:11:32.232 --> 00:11:33.071
Are you a ghost?

00:11:33.152 --> 00:11:34.431
Where did you pop out from?

00:11:37.112 --> 00:11:37.992
I came yesterday.

00:11:38.671 --> 00:11:39.472
Lin Tofu.

00:11:39.831 --> 00:11:40.711
Already working?

00:11:40.791 --> 00:11:41.911
Enthusiastic, huh?

00:11:43.311 --> 00:11:44.431
The broadcast was down.

00:11:44.951 --> 00:11:45.632
I just fixed it.

00:11:46.071 --> 00:11:46.392
Okay.

00:11:54.152 --> 00:11:55.791
Fill in the form.

00:12:00.911 --> 00:12:01.632
What form?

00:12:02.112 --> 00:12:03.032
Staff registration.

00:12:04.191 --> 00:12:04.872
It's mandatory.

00:12:07.112 --> 00:12:08.152
I'm too busy for this.

00:12:08.272 --> 00:12:09.032
Who isn't busy?

00:12:10.232 --> 00:12:11.272
You know all about me.

00:12:11.472 --> 00:12:12.071
Do it for me.

00:12:13.112 --> 00:12:14.272
How do I do that?

00:12:14.791 --> 00:12:15.831
What do I know about you?

00:12:16.071 --> 00:12:16.992
Are we that close?

00:12:18.911 --> 00:12:20.711
Are you awkward with your handwriting?

00:12:21.191 --> 00:12:21.591
Let me.

00:12:21.671 --> 00:12:22.232
Note it down.

00:12:22.272 --> 00:12:22.632
Okay.

00:12:24.032 --> 00:12:24.951
Name.

00:12:26.071 --> 00:12:27.152
Lin Tofu.

00:12:27.711 --> 00:12:28.311
Lin Tofu?

00:12:28.791 --> 00:12:29.472
Lin Dongfu.

00:12:30.472 --> 00:12:31.311
Gender.

00:12:31.632 --> 00:12:32.992
I know, male.

00:12:33.311 --> 00:12:35.352
No, write "not female".

00:12:36.911 --> 00:12:37.512
Age.

00:12:37.752 --> 00:12:38.352
Your age?

00:12:39.032 --> 00:12:40.431
Have you grown at all?

00:12:41.951 --> 00:12:42.791
Write "unknown".

00:12:44.551 --> 00:12:45.191
What's next?

00:12:45.352 --> 00:12:46.136
Birth of origin.

00:12:46.392 --> 00:12:47.071
Jinshan.

00:12:48.951 --> 00:12:49.392
Occupation.

00:12:49.752 --> 00:12:52.032
Occupation. A rock.

00:12:53.112 --> 00:12:54.232
Marital status.

00:12:54.551 --> 00:12:55.671
A rock.

00:13:03.352 --> 00:13:04.191
A Jeep.

00:13:07.032 --> 00:13:07.752
Hello.

00:13:07.864 --> 00:13:09.191
I'm Li Qiuping from the county.

00:13:09.872 --> 00:13:11.191
Is Secretary Zheng here?

00:13:11.752 --> 00:13:12.951
What a young county leader.

00:13:13.352 --> 00:13:13.872
Wonderful.

00:13:15.152 --> 00:13:16.431
Welcome.

00:13:17.352 --> 00:13:19.352
I'm Xie Chunlai,
the second-in-command here.

00:13:21.671 --> 00:13:22.071
Well...

00:13:22.232 --> 00:13:23.551
Head inside.

00:13:23.831 --> 00:13:24.632
Turn over there.

00:13:24.671 --> 00:13:25.551
- Park there.
- Okay.

00:13:25.551 --> 00:13:26.472
Okay.

00:13:26.831 --> 00:13:27.392
Madam.

00:13:27.392 --> 00:13:28.831
- Come inside.
- Okay.

00:13:29.872 --> 00:13:30.472
So young.

00:13:30.791 --> 00:13:31.671
Look at our compound.

00:13:32.112 --> 00:13:33.992
The car can drive right in.

00:13:40.272 --> 00:13:41.791
Will Mr. Zheng be here soon?

00:13:42.551 --> 00:13:44.352
He's busy. I'm keeping an eye on things.

00:13:44.591 --> 00:13:45.392
Hello, Mayor Xie.

00:13:46.872 --> 00:13:47.632
How did you know?

00:13:47.992 --> 00:13:50.392
Didn't you just say
you were the second-in-command?

00:13:53.071 --> 00:13:54.951
I'm a reporter from "New City Life".

00:13:55.032 --> 00:13:57.431
I came to do a piece
on Secretary Zheng Decheng.

00:13:57.711 --> 00:13:58.152
A reporter

00:13:58.791 --> 00:13:59.711
from the province.

00:13:59.992 --> 00:14:01.232
No wonder you have

00:14:01.551 --> 00:14:02.791
such sharp hearing.

00:14:03.671 --> 00:14:04.032
Okay.

00:14:04.071 --> 00:14:05.152
- Bring some tea.
- Alright.

00:14:05.232 --> 00:14:05.711
The tea.

00:14:05.831 --> 00:14:06.551
Coming.

00:14:06.711 --> 00:14:07.632
He's not here.

00:14:07.992 --> 00:14:09.711
You can interview me first.

00:14:09.791 --> 00:14:10.232
Here.

00:14:10.311 --> 00:14:10.992
Thank you.

00:14:10.992 --> 00:14:11.431
Thank you.

00:14:11.551 --> 00:14:12.280
Have some water.

00:14:12.831 --> 00:14:13.791
You too, Mr. Reporter.

00:14:14.472 --> 00:14:16.791
Reporter? You're a reporter?

00:14:16.791 --> 00:14:17.392
Go to work.

00:14:18.911 --> 00:14:21.431
Oh, right, about my rent...

00:14:21.472 --> 00:14:22.311
When are you...

00:14:24.392 --> 00:14:25.176
What's the rush?

00:14:25.911 --> 00:14:26.591
What's the rush?

00:14:26.671 --> 00:14:27.152
Come on.

00:14:28.352 --> 00:14:29.431
Did I refuse to pay you?

00:14:30.472 --> 00:14:32.791
I told you we don't have the seal yet.

00:14:33.352 --> 00:14:34.112
How do I pay you?

00:14:34.512 --> 00:14:35.256
What's the rush?

00:14:35.472 --> 00:14:37.071
Do you even have the money to pay?

00:14:38.352 --> 00:14:39.632
When will Mr. Zheng be here?

00:14:40.311 --> 00:14:41.311
I just got here

00:14:41.591 --> 00:14:42.591
and haven't met him.

00:14:43.272 --> 00:14:43.872
Is that so?

00:14:44.232 --> 00:14:44.632
Yeah.

00:14:55.112 --> 00:14:55.512
Leader.

00:14:56.591 --> 00:14:57.392
I'm not the leader.

00:14:57.752 --> 00:14:58.152
I...

00:15:02.152 --> 00:15:03.071
Go ahead.

00:15:04.632 --> 00:15:05.112
Leader.

00:15:07.551 --> 00:15:08.191
Reporting in?

00:15:08.711 --> 00:15:09.551
Get registered.

00:15:09.752 --> 00:15:10.152
Okay.

00:15:12.911 --> 00:15:13.352
Newcomer.

00:15:13.872 --> 00:15:14.512
Look at him.

00:15:14.872 --> 00:15:15.551
So energetic.

00:15:16.071 --> 00:15:16.551
Leader.

00:15:17.512 --> 00:15:18.472
I'm not the leader.

00:15:19.352 --> 00:15:19.711
Here.

00:15:21.831 --> 00:15:22.752
It's all the same.

00:15:29.831 --> 00:15:30.632
Only three people.

00:15:34.232 --> 00:15:35.512
Yu Qingtian.

00:15:36.191 --> 00:15:37.152
What a lovely name.

00:15:37.512 --> 00:15:39.191
So talented. You play guitar, too.

00:15:39.551 --> 00:15:40.152
Just a little.

00:15:40.632 --> 00:15:42.272
Leader, where is my room?

00:15:42.551 --> 00:15:44.671
The two of you...

00:15:45.232 --> 00:15:47.352
Go behind here, second floor.

00:15:48.272 --> 00:15:49.512
Two rooms on the right.

00:15:49.951 --> 00:15:50.872
Pick your rooms.

00:15:51.272 --> 00:15:51.711
Okay.

00:16:34.911 --> 00:16:35.352
Let's go.

00:16:37.472 --> 00:16:38.232
Alright, let's go.

00:16:39.928 --> 00:16:42.360
(Outstanding Worker Award)

00:16:46.424 --> 00:16:47.608
(Welcome Yuehai Cadres for Reporting)

00:17:01.272 --> 00:17:01.671
Hello.

00:17:02.872 --> 00:17:03.591
Welcome.

00:17:03.591 --> 00:17:04.032
Hello.

00:17:04.152 --> 00:17:05.071
You know calligraphy?

00:17:05.071 --> 00:17:05.391
No.

00:17:05.591 --> 00:17:05.992
Yeah?

00:17:05.992 --> 00:17:07.512
There is a problem.

00:17:07.512 --> 00:17:11.111
This sign of the People's Government
of Yuehai Town,

00:17:11.151 --> 00:17:12.032
Pingchuan County,

00:17:12.472 --> 00:17:14.472
violates national regulations.

00:17:16.351 --> 00:17:17.311
Let me explain.

00:17:17.871 --> 00:17:19.192
Look.

00:17:20.071 --> 00:17:20.791
My height

00:17:21.071 --> 00:17:24.311
is 173.5 centimeters.

00:17:24.752 --> 00:17:25.472
Looking at it,

00:17:25.512 --> 00:17:26.551
I can tell this sign

00:17:26.952 --> 00:17:29.512
is clearly over 2.4 meters tall.

00:17:30.391 --> 00:17:32.351
It's the standard for the county level.

00:17:33.111 --> 00:17:34.232
It's oversized for a town.

00:17:34.952 --> 00:17:35.512
But this...

00:17:35.672 --> 00:17:36.151
Hands off.

00:17:36.351 --> 00:17:36.912
Relax.

00:17:36.912 --> 00:17:38.311
Come on, hands off it.

00:17:39.391 --> 00:17:40.351
Listen to me.

00:17:40.432 --> 00:17:41.871
When I measure it like this,

00:17:41.912 --> 00:17:43.192
it's about 20 centimeters.

00:17:43.432 --> 00:17:45.111
According to regulations,

00:17:45.432 --> 00:17:47.591
36 centimeters is compliant
for town-level signs.

00:17:48.351 --> 00:17:48.952
Who are you?

00:17:49.591 --> 00:17:50.432
Let me finish.

00:17:50.512 --> 00:17:51.791
Or I'll feel terrible.

00:17:53.111 --> 00:17:54.432
The font should be

00:17:54.912 --> 00:17:57.272
dignified and serious.

00:17:57.512 --> 00:17:58.631
Generally,

00:17:58.712 --> 00:17:59.871
it's Heiti or FangSong.

00:17:59.912 --> 00:18:00.912
What style is this?

00:18:01.192 --> 00:18:02.472
Tacky. So tacky.

00:18:02.672 --> 00:18:03.831
It's not about that.

00:18:03.831 --> 00:18:04.912
What is this style?

00:18:05.992 --> 00:18:06.512
My style.

00:18:07.151 --> 00:18:08.472
Excuse me, who are you?

00:18:08.752 --> 00:18:10.712
We'll talk about this later.

00:18:11.032 --> 00:18:11.831
Another problem.

00:18:12.232 --> 00:18:13.391
Look at this banner above.

00:18:14.351 --> 00:18:16.391

00:18:16.432 --> 00:18:16.992
Stop pointing.

00:18:17.111 --> 00:18:18.591
Talk without pointing fingers.

00:18:19.912 --> 00:18:21.311
The last character is a white-out.

00:18:21.311 --> 00:18:21.992
You know?

00:18:22.512 --> 00:18:24.591
White looks good on the red background.

00:18:24.952 --> 00:18:25.272
You...

00:18:25.391 --> 00:18:26.631
It attracts attention.

00:18:26.672 --> 00:18:27.912
Stop being so unreasonable.

00:18:27.992 --> 00:18:28.712
Who's being

00:18:28.992 --> 00:18:29.631
unreasonable?

00:18:29.712 --> 00:18:30.912
I'm pointing out the problems.

00:18:31.232 --> 00:18:32.312
Glasses make you cultured?

00:18:33.311 --> 00:18:34.311
But that last character

00:18:34.311 --> 00:18:35.272
is just plain wrong.

00:18:35.432 --> 00:18:36.232
You can look it up

00:18:36.351 --> 00:18:37.512
in the Xinhua Dictionary.

00:18:37.551 --> 00:18:38.351
What does

00:18:38.512 --> 00:18:39.432
"report" mean?

00:18:39.631 --> 00:18:43.151
It's used when explaining facts
and news dissemination.

00:18:43.311 --> 00:18:46.752
What you should write
is "reporting in", got it?

00:18:50.952 --> 00:18:51.752
They're here.

00:18:52.232 --> 00:18:54.071
The town mayor has arrived.

00:18:54.151 --> 00:18:55.151
Shouldn't I report it?

00:18:55.311 --> 00:18:56.672
I did it on purpose.

00:18:56.992 --> 00:18:58.232
Welcome to the "report".

00:18:58.391 --> 00:18:58.912
- Okay.
- Got it?

00:18:58.992 --> 00:18:59.672
This design

00:19:00.071 --> 00:19:01.391
even cost me more.

00:19:01.391 --> 00:19:02.032
Okay, I-I...

00:19:02.111 --> 00:19:02.831
This is my style.

00:19:03.032 --> 00:19:03.712
Stop talking.

00:19:03.791 --> 00:19:04.871
I know. Who are you?

00:19:04.992 --> 00:19:05.391
I...

00:19:05.391 --> 00:19:06.952
Just tell me. Who are you?

00:19:06.952 --> 00:19:08.391
I-I used to work with words.

00:19:08.432 --> 00:19:09.351
I can't stand mistakes.

00:19:09.351 --> 00:19:10.071
Let's not argue.

00:19:12.591 --> 00:19:13.631
I just want to tell you.

00:19:13.912 --> 00:19:16.512
Since you are responsible
for these tasks,

00:19:16.791 --> 00:19:19.831
find a colleague
who understands words and culture

00:19:19.871 --> 00:19:23.752
to help you with your work, okay?

00:19:24.752 --> 00:19:26.351
Wait. Help me with what?

00:19:27.032 --> 00:19:28.232
I'm uneducated, huh?

00:19:28.512 --> 00:19:29.591
Let's go in first, okay?

00:19:29.631 --> 00:19:31.311
The meeting is about to start.

00:19:35.432 --> 00:19:36.672
Are you 1.73 meters tall?

00:19:38.232 --> 00:19:39.272
What's his problem?

00:19:39.672 --> 00:19:40.432
No manners.

00:19:41.992 --> 00:19:44.071
Sorry, I got a bit carried away.

00:19:44.311 --> 00:19:46.111
May I ask where Secretary Zheng is?

00:19:46.432 --> 00:19:47.391
When is the meeting?

00:19:48.432 --> 00:19:49.551
We're not from here.

00:19:49.752 --> 00:19:50.551
We're also waiting.

00:19:51.712 --> 00:19:52.272
Sorry.

00:19:54.712 --> 00:19:56.111
Is this the meeting room?

00:19:57.272 --> 00:19:58.071
Such a big table.

00:20:00.752 --> 00:20:01.512
Anyone here?

00:20:01.672 --> 00:20:03.752
Is this the meeting room?
When is the meeting?

00:20:03.752 --> 00:20:04.391
Sir.

00:20:04.712 --> 00:20:05.272
Come here.

00:20:06.071 --> 00:20:07.351
Come here.

00:20:16.472 --> 00:20:17.071
Sorry.

00:20:17.391 --> 00:20:18.151
I got carried away.

00:20:18.512 --> 00:20:19.551
Educated people like us

00:20:19.791 --> 00:20:20.512
get carried away.

00:20:23.071 --> 00:20:23.831
Alright.

00:20:24.432 --> 00:20:25.472
I am Tan Guangming.

00:20:25.791 --> 00:20:26.831
"Tan" as in Tan Sitong.

00:20:26.952 --> 00:20:27.992
"Guangming" as in light.

00:20:28.111 --> 00:20:28.871
Hello, Guangming.

00:20:28.992 --> 00:20:29.631
Hello.

00:20:29.871 --> 00:20:32.791
Thankfully, you weren't assigned here.

00:20:33.512 --> 00:20:34.791
I still feel it's a pity.

00:20:35.351 --> 00:20:36.752
Water Margin, Xie Zhen, Xie Bao.

00:20:37.232 --> 00:20:39.151
Nice to meet you, Xie Chunlai. Right.

00:20:40.551 --> 00:20:42.391
- The letter of introduction.
- Yeah, give it to me.

00:20:42.871 --> 00:20:43.232
Okay.

00:20:43.551 --> 00:20:45.351
Mr. Zheng transferred me from Jiangku.

00:20:46.151 --> 00:20:47.351
Mr. Zheng and I

00:20:47.391 --> 00:20:48.391
are comrades-in-arms.

00:20:48.432 --> 00:20:48.952
Alright.

00:20:49.151 --> 00:20:50.032
I'll just wait here

00:20:50.071 --> 00:20:51.032
for Mr. Zheng.

00:20:56.111 --> 00:20:57.472
Everybody knows Mr. Zheng.

00:21:10.672 --> 00:21:11.151
No.

00:21:11.512 --> 00:21:12.831
Move a bit to the right.

00:21:13.272 --> 00:21:14.264
Shouldn't I stand still?

00:21:14.831 --> 00:21:15.912
No, move to the right.

00:21:16.071 --> 00:21:16.672
Whose right?

00:21:17.631 --> 00:21:18.472
My right.

00:21:18.752 --> 00:21:19.311
Move a bit.

00:21:19.912 --> 00:21:20.791
Hi, Mr. Zheng.

00:21:21.071 --> 00:21:21.512
Hi there.

00:21:23.071 --> 00:21:23.672
Mr. Zheng.

00:21:27.631 --> 00:21:28.591
This is Zheng Decheng.

00:21:29.151 --> 00:21:29.712
Sir.

00:21:30.551 --> 00:21:31.071
Come on.

00:21:31.232 --> 00:21:31.831
Mr. Zheng.

00:21:32.712 --> 00:21:32.952
Sir.

00:21:32.992 --> 00:21:33.831
Three thousand yuan.

00:21:34.591 --> 00:21:35.952
I borrowed from the villagers.

00:21:36.232 --> 00:21:37.351
Tan, keep this safe.

00:21:37.712 --> 00:21:38.871
It's our startup capital.

00:21:39.672 --> 00:21:42.032
Pay Little Conch the rent first.

00:21:42.472 --> 00:21:44.351
Then buy some decent tables and chairs,

00:21:44.391 --> 00:21:45.432
and daily necessities

00:21:45.512 --> 00:21:47.071
like bowls, chopsticks,

00:21:47.472 --> 00:21:49.151
and thermos flasks, okay?

00:21:49.272 --> 00:21:49.871
Alright.

00:21:50.791 --> 00:21:51.432
Thanks.

00:21:51.672 --> 00:21:52.871
Thanks.

00:21:53.472 --> 00:21:54.871
Every effort yields results.

00:21:56.432 --> 00:21:57.032
We will have

00:21:57.351 --> 00:21:58.151
a fancy dinner.

00:21:59.831 --> 00:22:00.831
How do we pay them back?

00:22:01.111 --> 00:22:02.551
We have nothing apart from

00:22:02.992 --> 00:22:03.791
our meager salaries.

00:22:03.992 --> 00:22:04.831
Dock my salary.

00:22:05.071 --> 00:22:05.791
Shrimp.

00:22:06.472 --> 00:22:07.351
Look over here.

00:22:07.712 --> 00:22:08.351
Peel shrimp.

00:22:09.272 --> 00:22:11.272
We borrowed 3000 yuan from them.

00:22:11.472 --> 00:22:13.631
We'll peel shrimp for half a year
to pay them back

00:22:14.192 --> 00:22:15.952
and do it for free
for another half year.

00:22:16.391 --> 00:22:17.912
They'll come to pick it up every day.

00:22:17.952 --> 00:22:18.311
Shrimp.

00:22:18.472 --> 00:22:19.912
Here, have some water.

00:22:20.111 --> 00:22:21.016
Thanks, Little Conch.

00:22:26.591 --> 00:22:27.111
Lin.

00:22:29.672 --> 00:22:30.791
It's been years.

00:22:32.391 --> 00:22:33.336
How old is your kid?

00:22:34.272 --> 00:22:35.151
I'm still single.

00:22:36.871 --> 00:22:38.111
How come?

00:22:38.512 --> 00:22:39.871
Do you have a partner?

00:22:41.992 --> 00:22:42.992
No, not really.

00:22:44.071 --> 00:22:45.591
You're almost forty.

00:22:45.672 --> 00:22:46.712
And still no partner?

00:22:46.992 --> 00:22:47.391
I...

00:22:47.432 --> 00:22:48.351
You need to hurry up.

00:22:48.512 --> 00:22:50.391
Outstanding worker. He's busy.

00:22:50.591 --> 00:22:50.992
So...

00:22:52.111 --> 00:22:53.151
Get on it.

00:22:53.151 --> 00:22:54.151
It's the top priority.

00:22:54.512 --> 00:22:54.952
Mr. Zheng.

00:22:54.992 --> 00:22:55.351
Yeah.

00:22:55.391 --> 00:22:56.512
They've been waiting.

00:22:56.672 --> 00:22:58.311
Leader from the county.

00:22:58.752 --> 00:23:00.032
And reporter. For the interview.

00:23:01.631 --> 00:23:02.831
I invited him here

00:23:02.871 --> 00:23:03.831
but forgot about it.

00:23:04.752 --> 00:23:05.871
- Come on.
- So sorry.

00:23:07.512 --> 00:23:08.232
Let me just...

00:23:08.472 --> 00:23:09.432
Follow the procedure.

00:23:09.551 --> 00:23:10.351
Hello, Mr. Zheng.

00:23:10.752 --> 00:23:12.992
Li. What brings you here?

00:23:14.032 --> 00:23:14.912
Hello, Mr. Zheng.

00:23:15.351 --> 00:23:16.551
Nice to meet you.

00:23:17.752 --> 00:23:18.472
Nice to meet you.

00:23:18.551 --> 00:23:20.631
I'm Du Tao,
a reporter from "New City Life".

00:23:20.712 --> 00:23:21.952
Alright, Mr. Reporter.

00:23:21.992 --> 00:23:23.712
Here is my letter of introduction

00:23:23.952 --> 00:23:24.712
from Editor Xiao.

00:23:24.791 --> 00:23:25.272
Alright.

00:23:26.591 --> 00:23:28.032
Perfect timing.

00:23:28.192 --> 00:23:29.512
It's our first day here.

00:23:30.712 --> 00:23:31.712
Qiuping is my girlfriend.

00:23:31.752 --> 00:23:32.752
I asked her to bring me.

00:23:34.111 --> 00:23:35.752
I knew it was too much of a coincidence.

00:23:36.952 --> 00:23:37.591
You know what?

00:23:38.192 --> 00:23:40.151
They do look like

00:23:40.351 --> 00:23:41.032
a perfect match.

00:23:41.151 --> 00:23:41.432
Thanks.

00:23:41.432 --> 00:23:41.871
Right?

00:23:42.512 --> 00:23:43.232
Mr. Zheng.

00:23:43.391 --> 00:23:44.952
Three thousand yuan. I've checked it.

00:23:46.232 --> 00:23:47.272
The amount is correct.

00:23:47.351 --> 00:23:48.311
I'll write a receipt.

00:23:48.351 --> 00:23:49.032
I see.

00:23:49.032 --> 00:23:50.111
It's such a small matter.

00:23:50.151 --> 00:23:50.992
You decide.

00:23:51.111 --> 00:23:51.992
Okay, I'll write it.

00:23:51.992 --> 00:23:52.472
Okay.

00:23:52.472 --> 00:23:54.071
Editor-in-chief Xiao told me

00:23:54.071 --> 00:23:54.952
to take photos

00:23:54.992 --> 00:23:56.311
and show support.

00:23:57.192 --> 00:23:57.912
That's great.

00:23:58.151 --> 00:23:59.752
So, what should we do?

00:24:01.311 --> 00:24:03.871
I heard you wanted to take a photo.

00:24:03.912 --> 00:24:04.912
I can help with that.

00:24:05.351 --> 00:24:05.952
Great.

00:24:06.032 --> 00:24:06.712
That'd be great.

00:24:06.752 --> 00:24:08.631
Your camera must be better than Lin's.

00:24:09.071 --> 00:24:10.432
So, can you arrange it?

00:24:10.631 --> 00:24:11.111
Okay.

00:24:11.192 --> 00:24:12.591
We'll do exactly as you say.

00:24:13.192 --> 00:24:13.871
Hold still.

00:24:13.871 --> 00:24:14.631
Don't blink.

00:24:14.712 --> 00:24:15.311
Okay.

00:24:15.752 --> 00:24:17.512
One, two...

00:24:18.111 --> 00:24:18.992
W-Wait.

00:24:19.151 --> 00:24:19.952
I forgot my hat.

00:24:20.591 --> 00:24:21.272
Almost.

00:24:21.311 --> 00:24:22.992
The hat doesn't look proper.

00:24:24.912 --> 00:24:25.712
Just toss it behind.

00:24:26.071 --> 00:24:26.432
Okay.

00:24:27.032 --> 00:24:27.391
Ready?

00:24:27.791 --> 00:24:28.591
Yeah.

00:24:28.631 --> 00:24:29.432
Come on.

00:24:29.472 --> 00:24:30.232
Okay.

00:24:30.551 --> 00:24:31.351
Right away.

00:24:31.472 --> 00:24:31.871
Okay.

00:24:32.992 --> 00:24:34.071
Okay, good.

00:24:34.831 --> 00:24:35.912
One, two...

00:24:36.871 --> 00:24:37.311
I'm late.

00:24:37.472 --> 00:24:38.672
Hello, leader.

00:24:38.952 --> 00:24:39.992
Hello, leader.

00:24:40.351 --> 00:24:40.912
Chen Zhen.

00:24:41.672 --> 00:24:42.192
Leader.

00:24:42.791 --> 00:24:44.391
Are you Yu?

00:24:44.631 --> 00:24:45.111
- Qingtian.
- Yu Qing...

00:24:45.272 --> 00:24:46.151
- Yu Qingtian.
- Yeah.

00:24:46.351 --> 00:24:47.512
Why is your hair so long?

00:24:47.512 --> 00:24:48.631
I thought you were a girl.

00:24:48.752 --> 00:24:49.912
Aren't you a man?

00:24:49.912 --> 00:24:51.512
He plays the instrument.

00:24:51.631 --> 00:24:52.712
He has his own style.

00:24:52.712 --> 00:24:54.032
I'll get a haircut tomorrow.

00:24:54.071 --> 00:24:54.912
No, it's alright.

00:24:55.232 --> 00:24:55.791
Lin.

00:24:56.071 --> 00:24:56.992
Let me introduce you.

00:24:57.032 --> 00:24:57.992
This is Yu,

00:24:58.472 --> 00:25:01.432
an engineering graduate
assigned to us by the county.

00:25:01.631 --> 00:25:02.512
He'll be

00:25:02.551 --> 00:25:03.752
your apprentice, okay?

00:25:04.311 --> 00:25:04.791
Leader.

00:25:05.311 --> 00:25:06.351
You're an engineering

00:25:06.391 --> 00:25:07.032
student.

00:25:07.071 --> 00:25:08.192
What's with your hair?

00:25:08.311 --> 00:25:08.912
I like it.

00:25:08.912 --> 00:25:09.432
Too fancy.

00:25:09.591 --> 00:25:10.232
How tall is he?

00:25:10.232 --> 00:25:10.952
We are cadres...

00:25:10.992 --> 00:25:13.032
♪Child, this is your home♪

00:25:13.071 --> 00:25:13.672
Stop it.

00:25:13.672 --> 00:25:15.032
We need people like him.

00:25:15.151 --> 00:25:16.151
I'll cut it tomorrow.

00:25:16.232 --> 00:25:16.952
Not tomorrow.

00:25:17.551 --> 00:25:18.151
Cut it now.

00:25:18.992 --> 00:25:20.912
Sure, listen to your mentor.

00:25:21.071 --> 00:25:21.952
Cut it now.

00:25:22.311 --> 00:25:23.672
- Who can cut hair?
- What a shame.

00:25:23.912 --> 00:25:25.391
I-I have scissors for gauze.

00:25:25.391 --> 00:25:26.232
Lin Dongfu.

00:25:26.272 --> 00:25:27.831
Can I give you some advice, too?

00:25:28.071 --> 00:25:30.071
See, we're taking a group photo

00:25:30.111 --> 00:25:30.831
as cadres.

00:25:30.871 --> 00:25:31.472
The hard hat

00:25:31.512 --> 00:25:32.672
and the tank top?

00:25:33.151 --> 00:25:35.311
Shouldn't we find a collared shirt?

00:25:35.351 --> 00:25:36.992
I need to work after the photo.

00:25:37.032 --> 00:25:38.672
Can we find a collared shirt first?

00:25:38.672 --> 00:25:39.311
Enough.

00:25:39.311 --> 00:25:40.032
Stop arguing.

00:25:40.192 --> 00:25:40.912
Come on.

00:25:41.232 --> 00:25:42.351
Give him his glasses.

00:25:43.311 --> 00:25:44.071
This courtyard

00:25:44.311 --> 00:25:45.391
may look shabby.

00:25:45.912 --> 00:25:47.871
But it has a hundred years of history.

00:25:48.232 --> 00:25:49.432
It's not a famous site.

00:25:49.791 --> 00:25:51.551
But it's a historical site.

00:25:53.111 --> 00:25:54.151
Before liberation,

00:25:54.432 --> 00:25:57.472
this courtyard belonged
to Little Conch's family.

00:25:57.631 --> 00:26:00.311
After liberation,
it became a fireworks factory.

00:26:01.192 --> 00:26:03.272
Now it still belongs
to Little Conch's family.

00:26:03.512 --> 00:26:04.391
I was thinking

00:26:04.591 --> 00:26:06.311
this huge courtyard is sitting empty.

00:26:06.631 --> 00:26:07.232
Let's use it.

00:26:07.512 --> 00:26:09.871
And it'll give him some income. Perfect.

00:26:11.391 --> 00:26:12.232
You're ready?

00:26:12.472 --> 00:26:12.992
Yeah.

00:26:13.232 --> 00:26:14.192
I was thinking

00:26:14.512 --> 00:26:15.432
we should pick

00:26:15.551 --> 00:26:16.952
a meaningful spot for the photo.

00:26:16.992 --> 00:26:18.591
How about the library building?

00:26:19.111 --> 00:26:21.151
It's over a hundred years old.

00:26:21.551 --> 00:26:23.192
After policy restoration,

00:26:23.351 --> 00:26:24.472
we brought many good books.

00:26:24.791 --> 00:26:25.752
Take the photo here.

00:26:25.871 --> 00:26:26.472
- Okay?
- Okay.

00:26:27.111 --> 00:26:28.472
We must ask Guangming's

00:26:28.472 --> 00:26:29.032
opinion.

00:26:29.311 --> 00:26:30.672
The library building is nice.

00:26:31.311 --> 00:26:31.672
Let's go.

00:26:31.672 --> 00:26:32.591
Come on, picture time.

00:26:32.591 --> 00:26:33.351
- Mr. Zheng.
- I can

00:26:33.351 --> 00:26:34.432
even see the bookshelves.

00:26:34.472 --> 00:26:35.351
So many books.

00:26:35.391 --> 00:26:36.432
You must love this.

00:26:37.472 --> 00:26:37.992
Sir.

00:26:38.432 --> 00:26:40.032
Gloves look quite proper.

00:26:40.032 --> 00:26:40.631
No.

00:26:40.631 --> 00:26:41.232
I don't think

00:26:41.232 --> 00:26:41.992
the gloves look...

00:26:41.992 --> 00:26:42.912
Wait, I mean...

00:26:43.351 --> 00:26:44.391
Your haircut looks

00:26:45.032 --> 00:26:46.151
like a dog chewed it off.

00:26:47.071 --> 00:26:47.672
Fine.

00:26:47.672 --> 00:26:48.791
It's better than before.

00:26:48.952 --> 00:26:50.512
Come on, let's take pictures.

00:26:50.752 --> 00:26:52.432
Okay, look over here.

00:26:52.992 --> 00:26:53.831
Try not to blink.

00:26:54.071 --> 00:26:54.432
Okay.

00:26:54.672 --> 00:26:57.032
Come on. One, two, smile.

00:26:58.831 --> 00:26:59.672
Okay, one more shot.

00:27:00.192 --> 00:27:00.712
Wait.

00:27:01.232 --> 00:27:02.871
Let's get Ms. Xiao from the kitchen

00:27:02.992 --> 00:27:04.032
and Little Conch.

00:27:04.232 --> 00:27:04.672
Little Conch.

00:27:04.831 --> 00:27:05.791
I'll get them.

00:27:06.831 --> 00:27:08.591
And tell them to wear

00:27:08.631 --> 00:27:09.272
the uniform.

00:27:09.391 --> 00:27:10.104
Go to the center.

00:27:10.871 --> 00:27:11.432
No way.

00:27:11.912 --> 00:27:12.871
Li, join us.

00:27:13.192 --> 00:27:14.032
Let's take a photo.

00:27:14.032 --> 00:27:14.472
Madam.

00:27:14.472 --> 00:27:15.192
Since you're here.

00:27:15.192 --> 00:27:15.831
No, thanks.

00:27:15.831 --> 00:27:16.151
Come on.

00:27:16.151 --> 00:27:17.192
Since you're here.

00:27:17.432 --> 00:27:18.712
For memories.

00:27:18.712 --> 00:27:19.472
A group photo.

00:27:19.631 --> 00:27:19.992
Right?

00:27:20.151 --> 00:27:20.912
Mr. Du, come on.

00:27:21.151 --> 00:27:21.512
Join us.

00:27:21.551 --> 00:27:22.192
I'll pass.

00:27:22.272 --> 00:27:23.192
Fate brought you here.

00:27:23.192 --> 00:27:24.512
Let's take one together.

00:27:25.071 --> 00:27:26.712
Lin, doesn't the camera have a timer?

00:27:26.752 --> 00:27:27.791
Yeah, it does.

00:27:27.831 --> 00:27:28.591
It's ready.

00:27:28.672 --> 00:27:29.551
Alright, sit down.

00:27:29.591 --> 00:27:30.551
Balance it a bit.

00:27:30.591 --> 00:27:31.071
Come on.

00:27:39.071 --> 00:27:39.551
Okay.

00:27:45.551 --> 00:27:46.912
Come on, Li.

00:27:47.311 --> 00:27:47.912
This way.

00:27:49.631 --> 00:27:50.151
Look.

00:27:50.311 --> 00:27:51.791
This wall is huge.

00:27:51.912 --> 00:27:52.952
Completely blank.

00:27:53.151 --> 00:27:54.752
See the dimensions?

00:27:55.032 --> 00:27:56.351
Perfect size.

00:27:56.551 --> 00:27:59.192
Doesn't it feel like
it's missing something?

00:27:59.192 --> 00:28:00.151
Yeah, it does.

00:28:03.192 --> 00:28:03.712
Sir.

00:28:04.311 --> 00:28:06.192
We might be
thinking the same thing again.

00:28:06.472 --> 00:28:06.871
See?

00:28:08.512 --> 00:28:09.311
Put it right here.

00:28:09.512 --> 00:28:10.871
Right? Today's photo.

00:28:11.151 --> 00:28:13.351
Enlarge it and put it here.

00:28:16.311 --> 00:28:17.432
Problem solved.

00:28:17.551 --> 00:28:18.912
That's it. We have to go now.

00:28:19.351 --> 00:28:19.791
Already?

00:28:19.912 --> 00:28:20.512
Li.

00:28:20.631 --> 00:28:21.712
Wait for me.

00:28:22.232 --> 00:28:22.752
See them out.

00:28:23.071 --> 00:28:24.311
You're clueless.

00:28:28.232 --> 00:28:29.432
Drive safely. Be careful.

00:28:30.272 --> 00:28:31.151
Come visit.

00:28:31.631 --> 00:28:32.512
Stay safe.

00:28:44.791 --> 00:28:45.464
What's wrong?

00:28:48.232 --> 00:28:48.831
Mr. Zheng.

00:28:50.672 --> 00:28:52.151
I never got the chance

00:28:52.631 --> 00:28:53.871
to offer you my gift.

00:28:54.192 --> 00:28:57.071
Congratulations on your election
as the Secretary of Yuehai.

00:29:01.752 --> 00:29:02.512
The blueprint.

00:29:05.272 --> 00:29:07.631
Well....

00:29:08.311 --> 00:29:09.631
I-I'm speechless.

00:29:09.672 --> 00:29:11.712
Thank you so much.

00:29:13.071 --> 00:29:14.672
You've always cared about Yuehai.

00:29:15.791 --> 00:29:17.311
How can I ever repay you?

00:29:37.591 --> 00:29:38.111
Everyone,

00:29:39.032 --> 00:29:40.791
today marks our Yuehai Town Government's

00:29:41.071 --> 00:29:43.712
first full cadre work meeting.

00:29:44.512 --> 00:29:48.192
I requested each of you from the Party.

00:29:49.391 --> 00:29:50.591
I can say without hesitation

00:29:51.111 --> 00:29:53.432
that every one of you
is battle-tested elite

00:29:54.512 --> 00:29:55.992
recognized by the Party.

00:29:56.952 --> 00:29:59.111
Now I'll announce
the Party's appointments.

00:30:09.232 --> 00:30:10.752
Yuehai Town People's Government:

00:30:11.992 --> 00:30:14.232
Following the County's
Party Committee evaluation,

00:30:15.472 --> 00:30:18.591
the following members are appointed
as Yuehai Party Committee members:

00:30:19.512 --> 00:30:21.712
Zheng Decheng is appointed as Secretary,

00:30:22.311 --> 00:30:23.672
overseeing all operations

00:30:24.232 --> 00:30:25.432
in Yuehai.

00:30:25.791 --> 00:30:26.472
- Alright.
- Alright.

00:30:27.272 --> 00:30:27.791
Alright.

00:30:32.712 --> 00:30:33.472
Tan Guangming

00:30:33.912 --> 00:30:35.551
is appointed as deputy mayor,

00:30:35.800 --> 00:30:37.631
supervising finance
and disciplinary affairs.

00:30:37.631 --> 00:30:37.992
Alright.

00:30:38.672 --> 00:30:39.871
Fully expected.

00:30:40.192 --> 00:30:42.032
Make sure you discipline us.

00:30:42.071 --> 00:30:43.912
We can't make mistakes, okay?

00:30:44.071 --> 00:30:44.871
Rest assured.

00:30:45.672 --> 00:30:46.351
Lin Dongfu.

00:30:46.391 --> 00:30:46.712

overseeing demolition,
resettlement, and city construction.

00:30:51.551 --> 00:30:52.056
Understood.

00:30:52.591 --> 00:30:52.952
Alright.

00:30:56.871 --> 00:30:59.752
Sir, I'd like to express
some personal opinion.

00:30:59.791 --> 00:31:02.512
It's not that I have any issue with Xie.

00:31:02.712 --> 00:31:04.351
He is highly capable.

00:31:04.631 --> 00:31:05.512
I just feel

00:31:05.672 --> 00:31:08.631
that Lin might be more suitable
for the mayor position.

00:31:08.912 --> 00:31:09.672
He's composed.

00:31:10.391 --> 00:31:11.032
No, I'm not.

00:31:11.831 --> 00:31:12.432
But...

00:31:12.752 --> 00:31:16.391
Xie Chunlai is appointed
as deputy mayor.

00:31:18.752 --> 00:31:19.151
Alright.

00:31:19.791 --> 00:31:21.391
Overseeing personnel and logistics.

00:31:26.551 --> 00:31:28.752
Xie, help me if I get swamped

00:31:28.912 --> 00:31:29.912
with work.

00:31:31.192 --> 00:31:31.992
I-I...

00:31:31.992 --> 00:31:32.992
Well...

00:31:34.512 --> 00:31:35.752
Are you doubting me?

00:31:38.032 --> 00:31:38.591
No, no.

00:31:39.232 --> 00:31:39.791
Well...

00:31:41.712 --> 00:31:43.472
Three deputies?

00:31:43.791 --> 00:31:44.912
Who's in charge?

00:31:45.071 --> 00:31:46.432
He's right, sir.

00:31:46.472 --> 00:31:47.871
Who is the town mayor?

00:31:48.311 --> 00:31:49.712
I know what you're thinking.

00:31:50.311 --> 00:31:51.631
The higher-ups

00:31:52.192 --> 00:31:53.631
haven't finalized it yet.

00:31:54.151 --> 00:31:55.151
But rest assured,

00:31:55.952 --> 00:31:56.472
I promise

00:31:56.712 --> 00:31:59.472
the result will come out soon, okay?

00:31:59.512 --> 00:31:59.871
Alright.

00:32:00.351 --> 00:32:01.432
Sit down first.

00:32:01.752 --> 00:32:02.272
Easy.

00:32:02.512 --> 00:32:03.591
Listen to the leader.

00:32:03.631 --> 00:32:03.992
Okay?

00:32:04.912 --> 00:32:06.472
So, let's first discuss

00:32:06.512 --> 00:32:11.831
the specific work arrangements
for Yuehai's city construction, okay?

00:32:12.791 --> 00:32:13.311
Sir.

00:32:13.631 --> 00:32:14.591
I must emphasize

00:32:14.712 --> 00:32:16.432
that I can't agree with it.

00:32:16.672 --> 00:32:17.712
Seriously, I can't.

00:32:17.952 --> 00:32:18.712
On what?

00:32:19.311 --> 00:32:20.032
(In fact,)

00:32:20.712 --> 00:32:22.952
(building Yuehai City
faced numerous obstacles.)

00:32:23.912 --> 00:32:26.672
(I didn't know how they could
complete such a daunting task.)

00:32:28.432 --> 00:32:31.351
(That night, they seemed to argue
for a long time.)

00:32:32.791 --> 00:32:34.351
(But the next time I saw them,)

00:32:35.672 --> 00:32:36.712
(they were in trouble.)

00:32:40.391 --> 00:32:41.871
What? Selling land?

00:32:42.551 --> 00:32:43.111
Mr. Zhao.

00:32:43.752 --> 00:32:44.952
The Constitution stipulates

00:32:44.952 --> 00:32:47.512
that city land belongs to the state
and can't be traded.

00:32:48.272 --> 00:32:49.512
We have received reports

00:32:50.032 --> 00:32:52.631
that the Yuehai Town Government
might be trading land.

00:32:53.912 --> 00:32:54.672
Is there evidence?

00:32:55.591 --> 00:32:56.712
I know Zheng Decheng.

00:32:56.912 --> 00:32:58.512
He wouldn't make such a mistake.

00:33:00.151 --> 00:33:01.071
Mr. Zhao, look.

00:33:01.512 --> 00:33:02.952
We've gathered some information.

00:33:04.752 --> 00:33:06.432
Here are the land certificates

00:33:07.071 --> 00:33:07.591
they issued.

00:33:08.311 --> 00:33:09.071
The receipts.

00:33:09.432 --> 00:33:10.791
Amount and location

00:33:10.791 --> 00:33:11.391
are stated.

00:33:12.712 --> 00:33:15.591
These complaint letters
came from the Public Complaints Office

00:33:15.992 --> 00:33:17.912
(City Construction Fee)
accusing Yuehai of illegal land trading.

00:33:18.351 --> 00:33:19.192
Take a look.

00:33:19.591 --> 00:33:20.831
These land certificates

00:33:20.952 --> 00:33:22.232
represent plots of land.

00:33:23.071 --> 00:33:24.311
It's illegal land trading.

00:33:24.591 --> 00:33:25.992
T-This is outrageous.

00:33:26.591 --> 00:33:27.472
It sounds clear.

00:33:28.752 --> 00:33:29.712
Come on, sit down.

00:33:30.432 --> 00:33:30.912
Sit down.

00:33:31.992 --> 00:33:33.752
Li, take a look.

00:33:35.151 --> 00:33:35.712
Mr. Zhao.

00:33:36.032 --> 00:33:38.752
I suggest we investigate first.

00:33:39.311 --> 00:33:40.791
Let's not jump to conclusions.

00:33:41.472 --> 00:33:43.311
Everyone, I don't think we should

00:33:43.672 --> 00:33:46.151
elevate this
to the level of unconstitutionality

00:33:46.591 --> 00:33:48.591
before a thorough investigation.

00:33:48.952 --> 00:33:51.871
Of course, we can't jump to conclusions.

00:33:52.111 --> 00:33:53.871
We must rely on facts and evidence.

00:33:54.712 --> 00:33:57.952
Sir, we need to
handle this matter promptly.

00:33:59.111 --> 00:34:00.472
There will be trouble

00:34:00.952 --> 00:34:01.831
if it escalates.

00:34:08.591 --> 00:34:10.591
I propose we form an investigation team

00:34:11.711 --> 00:34:13.912
on the suspected illegal land trading.

00:34:14.231 --> 00:34:14.671
I agree.

00:34:15.432 --> 00:34:16.432
- Agreed.
- I agree.

00:34:16.992 --> 00:34:17.912
- I agree.
- Agreed.

00:34:19.872 --> 00:34:21.352
The investigation team

00:34:22.912 --> 00:34:24.184
will consist of Cai Gang...

00:34:27.032 --> 00:34:28.872
and Li Qiuping.

00:34:30.271 --> 00:34:31.231
Cai Gang,

00:34:31.231 --> 00:34:32.231
you'll be in charge...

00:34:32.352 --> 00:34:32.952
Sir,

00:34:33.392 --> 00:34:35.992
I'm in a sensitive position

00:34:36.751 --> 00:34:37.671
for this task.

00:34:38.032 --> 00:34:39.551
Well...

00:34:43.872 --> 00:34:45.231
Li Qiuping will be the leader.

00:34:45.512 --> 00:34:47.992
Cai Gang will assist her.

00:34:48.271 --> 00:34:49.151
Look into it.

00:34:49.432 --> 00:34:50.512
Keep the DIC updated

00:34:51.671 --> 00:34:52.711
at all times.

00:34:53.472 --> 00:34:55.111
Take the local police Tian Haiyang.

00:34:55.352 --> 00:34:57.032
Safeguard the people's property.

00:34:57.992 --> 00:34:58.512
Alright.

00:34:58.912 --> 00:34:59.512
No problem.

00:34:59.912 --> 00:35:00.352
Li.

00:35:00.711 --> 00:35:02.711
I don't care what you think.

00:35:03.271 --> 00:35:06.792
But you must be objective and impartial.

00:35:07.191 --> 00:35:07.952
Don't let me down.

00:35:08.832 --> 00:35:09.751
Rest assured, sir.

00:35:39.312 --> 00:35:39.952
Li.

00:35:40.872 --> 00:35:42.312
I'm from the county police office.

00:35:42.792 --> 00:35:43.591
We're here on duty.

00:35:44.071 --> 00:35:45.872
Please stop what you're doing.

00:35:45.992 --> 00:35:47.392
Please cooperate. Please stop.

00:35:48.352 --> 00:35:49.111
What...

00:35:49.512 --> 00:35:50.992
Mr. Zheng, good to see you again.

00:35:51.551 --> 00:35:52.312
Let's talk outside.

00:35:59.071 --> 00:36:00.271
What are you doing?

00:36:00.912 --> 00:36:01.512
Sir,

00:36:01.952 --> 00:36:03.671
DIC and the County Party Committee

00:36:03.832 --> 00:36:05.872
sent us to investigate the land trading.

00:36:06.432 --> 00:36:08.671
They want this investigation
concluded swiftly.

00:36:08.872 --> 00:36:11.551
We hope you can
help us complete this task

00:36:11.832 --> 00:36:13.111
as soon as possible.

00:36:13.312 --> 00:36:14.591
You're here to investigate us?

00:36:14.751 --> 00:36:15.151
Yes.

00:36:16.032 --> 00:36:17.151
We've received reports

00:36:17.392 --> 00:36:19.231
that you are involved in land dealings.

00:36:19.472 --> 00:36:20.352
What land dealings?

00:36:20.591 --> 00:36:21.792
Yeah, that's nonsense.

00:36:21.992 --> 00:36:23.071
We haven't sold any land.

00:36:23.071 --> 00:36:23.671
Not at all.

00:36:23.711 --> 00:36:24.551
Who said that?

00:36:24.631 --> 00:36:25.952
- Who said that?
- Take a look.

00:36:25.952 --> 00:36:26.792
Enough.

00:36:28.751 --> 00:36:29.472
We'll cooperate.

00:36:46.551 --> 00:36:46.952
Go ahead.

00:36:48.832 --> 00:36:49.551
You talk.

00:36:51.032 --> 00:36:53.032
You said we were selling land.

00:36:53.191 --> 00:36:54.071
Do you have proof?

00:36:58.071 --> 00:36:59.392
You're talking to me first.

00:37:01.032 --> 00:37:02.711
You recognize my importance here.

00:37:03.111 --> 00:37:04.271
Thank you for your trust.

00:37:05.551 --> 00:37:08.832
Let me tell you
how this money came about.

00:37:09.392 --> 00:37:11.352
We secured such a large sum

00:37:12.111 --> 00:37:15.231
due to people's trust
in our entire leadership team.

00:37:15.512 --> 00:37:16.631
We collected money

00:37:16.792 --> 00:37:17.912
for something important.

00:37:18.151 --> 00:37:20.231
This is the city construction fee.

00:37:22.392 --> 00:37:23.151
Yes, write it down.

00:37:23.352 --> 00:37:24.472
City construction fee.

00:37:24.912 --> 00:37:25.751
Mind your business.

00:37:28.032 --> 00:37:30.352
These farming households
bring their hard-earned money

00:37:30.631 --> 00:37:31.271
and ask

00:37:31.631 --> 00:37:34.711
to settle down in the city
we're going to build.

00:37:35.111 --> 00:37:37.151
They want to build Yuehai
together with us.

00:37:37.432 --> 00:37:38.191
What's the problem?

00:37:41.432 --> 00:37:42.312
What should I say?

00:37:45.432 --> 00:37:46.032
Are you done?

00:37:46.392 --> 00:37:47.071
Not yet.

00:37:47.512 --> 00:37:50.271
Every single fee has a clear record.

00:37:51.352 --> 00:37:52.032
Mr. Xie.

00:37:52.271 --> 00:37:52.992
If you're done,

00:37:53.071 --> 00:37:54.071
I have some questions.

00:37:54.392 --> 00:37:55.512
Just answer them.

00:38:15.032 --> 00:38:15.551
Mr. Lin.

00:38:16.151 --> 00:38:16.671
I...

00:38:16.992 --> 00:38:17.472
Please sit.

00:38:21.631 --> 00:38:22.271
Mr. Lin,

00:38:22.792 --> 00:38:24.591
why are you collecting money?

00:38:24.872 --> 00:38:25.592
To build roads.

00:38:32.312 --> 00:38:34.151
We're planning to build this one,

00:38:34.392 --> 00:38:35.832
this one, and this one.

00:38:36.551 --> 00:38:37.231
And then,

00:38:37.591 --> 00:38:39.151
we plan to build roads here, here,

00:38:39.312 --> 00:38:39.952
and here.

00:38:40.591 --> 00:38:41.271
All these places.

00:38:42.231 --> 00:38:44.191
From the seashore to the mountain foot.

00:38:44.352 --> 00:38:45.432
We will build many roads.

00:38:46.032 --> 00:38:48.056
The main arteries
will be 30 meters wide at least

00:38:48.151 --> 00:38:50.432
to handle future traffic congestion.

00:38:51.032 --> 00:38:51.711
- So...
- Mr. Lin,

00:38:52.392 --> 00:38:53.472
I know what you're saying.

00:38:54.111 --> 00:38:55.071
I drew this map.

00:39:05.992 --> 00:39:06.472
Yu.

00:39:09.392 --> 00:39:09.992
Your turn.

00:39:11.151 --> 00:39:11.711
Quiet.

00:39:21.392 --> 00:39:22.032
Leaders,

00:39:22.591 --> 00:39:23.751
I don't know anything.

00:39:24.032 --> 00:39:24.832
Yu Qingtian.

00:39:25.392 --> 00:39:26.952
Answer our questions.

00:39:27.671 --> 00:39:29.472
Aren't you a member
of the town government?

00:39:29.631 --> 00:39:30.671
I never wanted to come.

00:39:31.071 --> 00:39:32.512
If you don't believe me,

00:39:32.711 --> 00:39:33.832
ask Minister Guan.

00:39:34.231 --> 00:39:35.832
They came to my home

00:39:35.832 --> 00:39:36.551
and asked for me.

00:39:36.952 --> 00:39:38.352
My parents agreed to it.

00:39:39.191 --> 00:39:39.872
Leaders,

00:39:40.512 --> 00:39:41.751
it's so good to see you.

00:39:42.271 --> 00:39:44.631
I've sent several letters to the county.

00:39:45.231 --> 00:39:46.032
But no reply.

00:39:46.551 --> 00:39:47.151
Do me a favor.

00:39:47.432 --> 00:39:48.591
Sign this, and I can leave.

00:39:49.352 --> 00:39:49.792
Wait.

00:39:50.032 --> 00:39:52.472
I am the Director of the Land Bureau.

00:39:53.111 --> 00:39:54.151
I can't sign this.

00:39:56.631 --> 00:39:57.472
Land Bureau?

00:39:58.792 --> 00:40:00.111
Then just convey this message.

00:40:00.631 --> 00:40:01.872
Stop messing around, okay?

00:40:02.191 --> 00:40:03.071
Yu Qingtian,

00:40:03.512 --> 00:40:04.832
set aside this issue for now.

00:40:05.111 --> 00:40:09.711
Answer our questions first, alright?

00:40:10.071 --> 00:40:10.671
Alright then.

00:40:13.312 --> 00:40:14.512
Meng Xiaoli, right?

00:40:18.751 --> 00:40:19.792
Wait.

00:40:20.711 --> 00:40:21.271
Sit down.

00:40:21.631 --> 00:40:22.711
We have a few questions.

00:40:24.392 --> 00:40:24.872
Leave it.

00:40:30.711 --> 00:40:32.312
I-I'm just a health worker.

00:40:33.512 --> 00:40:34.952
You have questions for me?

00:40:35.352 --> 00:40:36.191
Don't be nervous.

00:40:36.432 --> 00:40:38.352
We're questioning everyone.

00:40:40.151 --> 00:40:41.071
I see.

00:40:43.032 --> 00:40:44.671
You're saying

00:40:46.631 --> 00:40:49.231
that there are bad people among them.

00:40:49.711 --> 00:40:52.111
I told you I don't know anything.

00:40:52.151 --> 00:40:54.432
But you insisted on questioning me...

00:40:59.432 --> 00:40:59.992
Mr. Tan.

00:41:00.432 --> 00:41:01.032
You're up.

00:41:07.912 --> 00:41:08.512
Mr. Tan,

00:41:09.071 --> 00:41:09.992
up until now,

00:41:10.231 --> 00:41:11.551
how much land have you sold?

00:41:12.591 --> 00:41:13.392
For how much money?

00:41:15.151 --> 00:41:16.912
Wait, leaders...

00:41:17.912 --> 00:41:19.992
Since you are investigating

00:41:20.271 --> 00:41:24.071
on behalf of the county DIC
and the County Party Committee,

00:41:24.111 --> 00:41:26.912
don't you think
it's premature to label it just yet?

00:41:27.231 --> 00:41:28.631
We weren't trading land.

00:41:28.711 --> 00:41:30.912
We were collecting
the city construction fee.

00:41:31.071 --> 00:41:32.912
And it's all reflected in the accounts.

00:41:32.952 --> 00:41:35.151
Every single payment received
is recorded there.

00:41:35.432 --> 00:41:36.472
City construction fee.

00:41:36.952 --> 00:41:39.352
Everyone in Yuehai has to pay this fee?

00:41:40.631 --> 00:41:41.071
No,

00:41:41.352 --> 00:41:43.551
it's not per person.

00:41:43.671 --> 00:41:45.312
We charge it per household.

00:41:45.711 --> 00:41:46.912
Depending on the location,

00:41:47.032 --> 00:41:48.231
the price varies.

00:41:49.591 --> 00:41:52.032
On average, it's 6,500 yuan.

00:41:52.151 --> 00:41:52.792
Mr. Tan,

00:41:53.352 --> 00:41:54.832
6,500 yuan per household.

00:41:55.111 --> 00:41:56.472
You have 1,200 households.

00:41:57.231 --> 00:41:59.071
But the total amount you collected

00:41:59.111 --> 00:42:00.111
doesn't seem to add up.

00:42:01.151 --> 00:42:04.231
You collected money for more plots
than there are resident households.

00:42:05.111 --> 00:42:05.992
I can explain that.

00:42:06.832 --> 00:42:07.231
Indeed,

00:42:07.912 --> 00:42:08.912
as of now,

00:42:09.032 --> 00:42:11.792
there are over 1,200 households.

00:42:12.032 --> 00:42:14.512
But everyone's needs are different.

00:42:14.792 --> 00:42:17.872
Some households might need two, three,

00:42:17.912 --> 00:42:19.191
or even four plots.

00:42:19.231 --> 00:42:21.792
Some have multiple generations
under one roof,

00:42:21.992 --> 00:42:23.432
so the house isn't big enough.

00:42:23.711 --> 00:42:26.591
Others needed land
for their own business expansion,

00:42:26.591 --> 00:42:27.432
not for housing,

00:42:27.472 --> 00:42:28.551
but for factories.

00:42:28.671 --> 00:42:29.191
So...

00:42:30.432 --> 00:42:33.312
Who came up with the term
"city construction fee"?

00:42:38.711 --> 00:42:40.551
Of course, all of us local cadres

00:42:40.591 --> 00:42:42.551
brainstormed it together.

00:42:45.032 --> 00:42:46.472
Who came up with it?

00:42:48.151 --> 00:42:48.751
I did.

00:42:50.912 --> 00:42:51.952
The economy is struggling.

00:42:52.711 --> 00:42:54.151
We lack funds for city construction.

00:42:54.631 --> 00:42:57.151
So, after deliberation
by the town Party committee,

00:42:57.711 --> 00:43:00.631
we decided to collect
a city construction fee.
