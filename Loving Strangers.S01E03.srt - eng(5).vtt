00:11:47.630 --> 00:11:48.300
Tell me.

00:11:48.440 --> 00:11:49.490
Small face, braid.

00:11:53.200 --> 00:11:54.650
Not this one!

00:11:54.670 --> 00:11:55.490
She's not that chubby!

00:11:55.510 --> 00:11:56.420
You can't even remember?

00:11:57.080 --> 00:11:57.850
Enough, stop looking.

00:11:57.870 --> 00:11:58.490
Go to the back!

00:11:58.720 --> 00:11:59.770
I'll watch. You grab her.

00:12:05.150 --> 00:12:06.300
Didn't recognize her, did you?

00:12:06.600 --> 00:12:07.580
You let her slip.

00:12:09.320 --> 00:12:10.420
You definitely didn't recognize her!

00:12:11.150 --> 00:12:11.940
I'm a film director.

00:12:11.960 --> 00:12:13.420
You think I can't remember a face?

00:12:13.670 --> 00:12:14.770
If you hadn't dragged your feet

00:12:14.790 --> 00:12:15.490
getting out the door,

00:12:15.510 --> 00:12:16.420
would we be late?

00:12:16.510 --> 00:12:17.420
And you say I didn't recognize her?

00:12:17.510 --> 00:12:18.770
I dragged my feet?

00:12:19.240 --> 00:12:19.770
Hey, Jiang Jialu!

00:12:19.790 --> 00:12:21.130
That's how you talk to your uncle?

00:12:21.360 --> 00:12:22.220
I'm your elder!

00:12:22.510 --> 00:12:23.580
You're just getting old.

00:12:23.600 --> 00:12:24.370
How could I not recognize her?

00:12:24.670 --> 00:12:26.100
You calling me old?

00:12:51.720 --> 00:12:52.490
Time to eat.

00:13:20.510 --> 00:13:22.820
Why'd we move out?

00:13:23.600 --> 00:13:24.650
Did something happen?

00:13:26.670 --> 00:13:27.180
Nothing.

00:13:27.600 --> 00:13:28.700
It's closer to my jobs here.

00:13:29.790 --> 00:13:32.580
We'll go back in a few days.

00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:11.340
Jiaqi, do you need 200k?

00:14:12.120 --> 00:14:13.100
How'd you get set up

00:14:13.120 --> 00:14:13.770
over 200k?

00:14:14.510 --> 00:14:14.890
Fine.

00:14:15.150 --> 00:14:15.770
If he screwed us,

00:14:16.120 --> 00:14:16.820
then that money should've been

00:14:16.840 --> 00:14:17.730
in our pocket, right?

00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:18.700
Jiaqi, I don't get it.

00:14:18.720 --> 00:14:19.650
Why didn't you

00:14:19.670 --> 00:14:21.130
turn it in right away?

00:14:21.670 --> 00:14:23.310
Does saying this now help?

00:14:23.510 --> 00:14:24.490
It's gone.

00:14:24.840 --> 00:14:25.430
Yeah, gone.

00:14:25.870 --> 00:14:26.820
Everything's gone.

00:14:27.550 --> 00:14:28.580
No matter how broke we were,

00:14:28.600 --> 00:14:29.490
we still had you

00:14:29.510 --> 00:14:30.420
working at a big company.

00:14:30.670 --> 00:14:32.010
Our mom could still hold her head up.

00:14:32.120 --> 00:14:32.770
Now look.

00:14:32.840 --> 00:14:33.610
Mom comes home,

00:14:33.670 --> 00:14:34.940
and sees three jobless middle-aged men.

00:14:35.120 --> 00:14:35.940
We're finished!

00:14:37.630 --> 00:14:38.180
It's fine.

00:14:38.750 --> 00:14:39.490
You still have me.

Yeah, you!

00:14:41.120 --> 00:14:42.250
Didn't you tell my mom

00:14:42.270 --> 00:14:43.530
to mortgage the house?

00:14:43.630 --> 00:14:44.580
Take the money out!

00:14:45.120 --> 00:14:45.890
Help my brother

00:14:45.910 --> 00:14:46.820
buy those cards back

00:14:46.840 --> 00:14:47.850
and fix this mess.

00:14:48.080 --> 00:14:49.490
What's that attitude of yours?

00:14:50.000 --> 00:14:51.610
I was just bullshitting about MLM.

00:14:51.720 --> 00:14:52.490
How could I

00:14:52.510 --> 00:14:53.770
really let my sister mortgage her house?

00:14:53.790 --> 00:14:54.370
Besides,

00:14:54.550 --> 00:14:55.610
the e-commerce cards you buy

00:14:55.750 --> 00:14:56.610
will have different numbers.

00:14:56.870 --> 00:14:57.490
If they trace it,

00:14:57.510 --> 00:14:58.420
it'll be even harder to explain!

00:14:58.550 --> 00:15:00.250
Weren't you saying we had you,

00:15:00.270 --> 00:15:00.890
that you'd be there?

00:15:01.000 --> 00:15:02.220
So tell me, what do we do now?

00:15:02.320 --> 00:15:03.220
What do you think we do?

00:15:03.240 --> 00:15:03.820
How old are you?

Are you a kid?

00:15:04.600 --> 00:15:05.420
Enough. Stop fighting.

00:15:05.440 --> 00:15:06.600
I never should've told you two.

Jiaqi!

I'm not done, Jiaqi.

Where are you going?

00:15:09.390 --> 00:15:10.060
Home.

00:15:10.720 --> 00:15:12.100
I'll wait at the company gate for her tomorrow.

00:15:12.790 --> 00:15:14.100
Who took the money and still goes to work?

00:15:14.240 --> 00:15:15.250
She said she didn't take it.

00:15:15.510 --> 00:15:16.300
So what's she afraid of?

00:15:16.510 --> 00:15:17.340
What if she doesn't show?

Hello?

00:15:31.000 --> 00:15:31.890
I'm off work.

00:15:32.240 --> 00:15:33.730
I'll swing by and pick you up.

00:15:34.390 --> 00:15:35.650
No need. I'll walk back.

00:15:37.670 --> 00:15:38.650
Oh, come get me.

00:15:38.870 --> 00:15:40.420
I'm across from the supermarket on Qingxi Road.

00:15:41.150 --> 00:15:42.370
Okay. Ten minutes.

00:15:43.270 --> 00:15:43.700
Okay.

00:15:45.600 --> 00:15:46.250
What's the matter?

Where are you headed?

00:15:56.270 --> 00:15:57.250
What were you just doing?

00:15:58.960 --> 00:15:59.650
Unbelievable.

00:15:59.650 --> 00:16:00.370
At a time like this,

00:16:00.390 --> 00:16:01.490
you still feel like eating?

00:16:04.670 --> 00:16:05.820
It's for your wife.

00:16:06.360 --> 00:16:07.530
She loves the seafood here.

00:16:15.000 --> 00:16:15.700
Jiaqi,

00:16:16.790 --> 00:16:17.820
the more it's like this,

00:16:18.270 --> 00:16:19.610
the better you should treat your wife.

00:16:20.440 --> 00:16:21.850
You've got to keep her close.

00:16:22.510 --> 00:16:23.610
If something really blows up,

00:16:24.200 --> 00:16:25.530
at least you still have a home.

Five minutes.

00:16:31.960 --> 00:16:33.180
Too short, it won't cook through.

00:16:33.750 --> 00:16:35.610
Too long, it gets tough and chewy.

00:16:35.870 --> 00:16:36.940
You waited on Auntie

00:16:36.960 --> 00:16:37.730
like this too, right?

00:16:38.630 --> 00:16:40.100
I learned it from taking care

00:16:40.120 --> 00:16:40.850
of my girl.

00:16:41.320 --> 00:16:42.840

is screwed.

00:16:57.840 --> 00:16:58.980
The Inspection Office has it all figured out?

00:17:00.000 --> 00:17:01.060
He won't cough up the cards.

00:17:01.080 --> 00:17:01.650
Then this whole thing

00:17:01.670 --> 00:17:03.250
is basically case closed.

00:17:04.640 --> 00:17:05.980
Always acting all high and mighty,

00:17:06.400 --> 00:17:06.980
who would've thought

00:17:07.640 --> 00:17:08.180
that over 200k,

00:17:09.440 --> 00:17:10.620

something's off.

00:17:17.070 --> 00:17:18.810
If he really didn't want the money,

00:17:19.070 --> 00:17:20.530
he should've returned it right away

00:17:20.640 --> 00:17:22.050
to the Inspection Office.

00:17:22.640 --> 00:17:23.860
What if he returns it?

00:17:24.200 --> 00:17:26.050
That just makes the bribery look even more real.

00:17:26.750 --> 00:17:27.810
He takes the 200k,

00:17:28.440 --> 00:17:29.860
then returns it once there's an investigation.

00:17:30.000 --> 00:17:30.940
You think he's that stupid?

00:17:31.880 --> 00:17:32.730
Either way,

Those people won't just sit and watch.

00:20:28.640 --> 00:20:29.620
and he got dragged into it.

00:20:30.510 --> 00:20:31.380
That wasn't...

00:20:34.350 --> 00:20:35.290
What do you mean?

00:20:36.000 --> 00:20:37.860
Gu Chen, I'm going to divorce him.

00:20:38.240 --> 00:20:38.860
But you need

00:20:38.880 --> 00:20:39.730
to give me time.

00:20:39.750 --> 00:20:40.980
Can you not blow this up?

00:20:42.830 --> 00:20:43.900
I think we can

00:20:43.920 --> 00:20:44.980
use this chance

00:20:45.030 --> 00:20:46.090
to get him out of Sen'an.

00:20:47.640 --> 00:20:49.140
We had to take that step sooner or later.

00:20:50.110 --> 00:20:50.940
He leaves Sen'an first,

00:20:50.960 --> 00:20:51.730
then you divorce.

00:20:51.750 --> 00:20:52.660
That's more reasonable,

00:20:53.510 --> 00:20:54.330
and better for all three of us.

00:20:54.550 --> 00:20:55.050
What do you think?

00:20:55.790 --> 00:20:56.490
You want him

00:20:56.590 --> 00:20:58.530
to walk away without explanation,

00:20:58.550 --> 00:20:59.810
then have me divorce him right away?

00:20:59.880 --> 00:21:00.980
Do you have a better plan?

00:21:11.960 --> 00:21:12.730
Now the key point is,

00:21:12.750 --> 00:21:14.090
those cards are gone.

00:21:14.960 --> 00:21:16.730
Yeah. He's freaking out too.

00:21:17.240 --> 00:21:17.860
Could it be

00:21:17.880 --> 00:21:18.700
he really took them?

00:21:19.510 --> 00:21:20.330
No. No way.

00:21:22.160 --> 00:21:23.330
At least confirm it.

00:21:54.880 --> 00:21:56.250
Jialu and Uncle

00:21:56.590 --> 00:21:57.570
are really okay?

00:22:07.240 --> 00:22:07.730
You think

00:22:07.750 --> 00:22:08.940
if something's wrong with them,

00:22:09.880 --> 00:22:11.220
I'd take those cards?

00:22:17.750 --> 00:22:18.980
That's not what I meant.

00:22:19.000 --> 00:22:19.810
I'm just thinking,

00:22:19.830 --> 00:22:20.620
those cards

00:22:21.160 --> 00:22:22.220
vanished out of nowhere.

00:22:22.240 --> 00:22:23.330
What on earth happened?

00:22:24.240 --> 00:22:25.620
I told you I don't know.

00:22:26.790 --> 00:22:27.700
You should've turned them in

00:22:27.720 --> 00:22:28.620
right away.

00:22:29.920 --> 00:22:30.770
I wanted to figure out

00:22:30.790 --> 00:22:31.660
what was going on first.

00:22:33.160 --> 00:22:33.940
Who sent them?

00:22:33.960 --> 00:22:34.860
Was it a mistake?

00:22:34.960 --> 00:22:36.140
Should I return them?

00:22:37.440 --> 00:22:38.960
But the label only had my name.

00:22:38.960 --> 00:22:40.140
I had zero clues.

00:22:43.960 --> 00:22:44.960
I planned to turn them in

00:22:44.960 --> 00:22:45.770
this morning.

00:22:46.270 --> 00:22:47.420
But when I got to work,

00:22:47.750 --> 00:22:48.770
they were already gone.

00:22:56.680 --> 00:22:57.900
Maybe you should just leave.

00:22:59.790 --> 00:23:01.140
I warned you ages ago.

00:23:02.310 --> 00:23:03.730
This isn't that simple.

00:23:04.790 --> 00:23:06.810
Sen'an is a snake pit.

00:23:06.810 --> 00:23:07.730
You're not built for it.

00:23:09.270 --> 00:23:09.920
I just don't get it.

00:23:09.920 --> 00:23:11.180
Why can't you leave?

It's not like you're incapable.

00:23:13.680 --> 00:23:14.420
One step forward,

00:24:53.830 --> 00:24:55.490
I did receive that pack,

[Main Conference Room]
I called everyone here today

00:26:01.790 --> 00:26:03.490
to talk it over

00:26:04.590 --> 00:26:05.490
about Director Jiang's case,

00:26:05.720 --> 00:26:06.380
and how to handle it.

00:26:07.590 --> 00:26:09.290
It's pretty clear.

00:26:09.510 --> 00:26:10.180
The day before yesterday,

00:26:10.200 --> 00:26:11.600
Director Jiang received a parcel.

00:26:11.600 --> 00:26:13.140
CCTV caught it all.

00:26:13.960 --> 00:26:14.770
That night,

00:26:14.830 --> 00:26:16.530
He came back to the office.

00:26:17.110 --> 00:26:17.660
I ran into him.

00:26:18.200 --> 00:26:20.420
He said he was grabbing files.

00:26:20.880 --> 00:26:22.570
Let Director Jiang return to work.

00:26:25.510 --> 00:26:26.330
What are you saying?

00:26:26.640 --> 00:26:28.010
I'm not even done.

00:26:32.160 --> 00:26:34.380
PV is drug vigilance,

00:26:34.440 --> 00:26:36.220
and it's the company's bottom line.

00:26:36.350 --> 00:26:37.140
You say

00:26:37.160 --> 00:26:38.380
he took 200k in e-commerce cards.

00:26:38.920 --> 00:26:39.420
Where are the cards?

00:26:41.200 --> 00:26:42.900
He did come back.

00:26:43.310 --> 00:26:44.420
But I checked the CCTV.

00:26:45.350 --> 00:26:46.940
It shows you were with him the whole time.

00:26:46.960 --> 00:26:48.050
Did you see him take anything?

00:26:49.160 --> 00:26:51.380
Only an idiot would take them in front of me.

00:26:52.440 --> 00:26:53.380
And isn't it convenient?

00:26:53.440 --> 00:26:54.940
The power went out that night.

00:26:55.720 --> 00:26:57.570
Before he ran into me,

00:26:57.640 --> 00:26:59.140
he had plenty of time to take them.

00:26:59.400 --> 00:27:00.180
So,

No, I don't have proof.

Anyway, they're not with me.

So where are they?

00:27:10.440 --> 00:27:11.700
You'll have to ask Director Jiang.

00:27:12.030 --> 00:27:12.620
No need.

00:27:13.880 --> 00:27:14.860

00:28:05.110 --> 00:28:06.700
while taking out the trash that night.

00:28:07.590 --> 00:28:08.330
He thought it was nothing,

00:28:08.510 --> 00:28:09.490
so he tossed it aside.

00:28:09.790 --> 00:28:10.900
The next day he opened it,

00:28:11.240 --> 00:28:13.050
and found it was all e-commerce cards.

00:28:13.590 --> 00:28:15.010
Director Jiang did come back

00:28:15.070 --> 00:28:16.380
that night,

00:28:17.000 --> 00:28:18.220
but not to take the cards.

00:28:19.030 --> 00:28:19.900
He came to throw them away.

00:28:22.000 --> 00:28:22.660

00:28:22.680 --> 00:28:23.380

Just give me the cards back.

00:28:25.000 --> 00:28:25.730
I tossed them.

00:28:26.720 --> 00:28:27.380
You threw them away?

00:28:28.510 --> 00:28:29.770
Why would you do that, Director Jiang?

00:28:29.960 --> 00:28:31.770
Why not hand them to the Inspection Office?

00:28:32.160 --> 00:28:33.220
The moment they showed up, they asked,

00:28:33.240 --> 00:28:35.140
"Where are the 200k e-commerce cards?"

00:28:36.070 --> 00:28:36.700
Let me ask you.

00:28:37.070 --> 00:28:38.530
Did you count them when you got them?

00:28:40.200 --> 00:28:41.620
I heard it from Director Su

00:28:41.680 --> 00:28:42.660
that it was 200k.

00:28:43.070 --> 00:28:44.510
I knew it because yesterday morning,

00:28:44.510 --> 00:28:45.250
we received a tip-off letter.

00:28:45.750 --> 00:28:46.770
It stated the amount.

00:28:48.920 --> 00:28:49.330
Everyone.

00:28:49.750 --> 00:28:50.180
Listen.

00:28:51.590 --> 00:28:53.290
He just got the cards,

00:28:53.590 --> 00:28:55.050
and the next day the Inspection Office got

00:28:55.270 --> 00:28:56.810
a detailed tip-off letter.

00:28:57.350 --> 00:28:57.980
Doesn't that

00:28:58.000 --> 00:28:59.490
look exactly like a trap?

00:29:01.200 --> 00:29:02.660
Good thing he didn't hand them in then.

00:29:03.270 --> 00:29:03.940
Otherwise,

00:29:04.350 --> 00:29:06.180
he might've ended up caught red-handed,

00:29:06.640 --> 00:29:07.700
with no way to explain it.

00:29:07.830 --> 00:29:09.420
Stop taking cheap shots.

00:29:10.200 --> 00:29:11.380
Did he throw them away willingly,

00:29:11.400 --> 00:29:12.180
or did he toss them

00:29:12.200 --> 00:29:12.940
because of the investigation?

00:29:13.070 --> 00:29:14.090
We still don't know!

00:29:14.110 --> 00:29:15.010
