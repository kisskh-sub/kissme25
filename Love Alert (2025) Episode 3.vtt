00:00:04.640 --> 00:00:06.400
(Previous)
There's something I must tell you.

00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:08.360
What… is it?

00:00:08.680 --> 00:00:10.120
Teh's in love with Fah.

00:00:11.080 --> 00:00:12.560
I'm craving a chill barbecue night.

00:00:12.680 --> 00:00:14.800
Sure. Just name the date.

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:16.240
P'Toh...

00:00:18.160 --> 00:00:19.520
Why is my heart racing?

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:21.760
I think… I'm really into you.

00:00:23.120 --> 00:00:24.400
Jimmy likes you.

00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:26.560
But I don't like him.

00:00:57.240 --> 00:00:58.240
Where's Fah?

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:04.680
He's been out since 4.

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:07.320
Something about catching the sunrise.

00:01:09.160 --> 00:01:10.160
How did you know?

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:17.600
I ran into him while I was jogging.

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:26.000
I thought you guys woke up together.

00:01:33.400 --> 00:01:35.840
I couldn't sleep. New bed, I guess.

00:01:36.400 --> 00:01:38.360
So I just got up to work out.

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:45.160
Hey, there's a court here.

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:46.920
Wanna shoot some hoops?

00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:48.560
Let's go.

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:49.920
Damn it, Jimmy. What the hell?

00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:52.200
My shirt's ruined.

00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:53.760
My bad.

00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:55.840
Didn't know my own strength.

00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:00.080
What were you staring at?

00:03:01.480 --> 00:03:02.560
Nothing.

00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:03.760
Bull crap.

00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:06.120
You're acting sketchy.

00:03:06.960 --> 00:03:08.320
What are you hiding from me?

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:11.280
Come on! I'm not hiding anything.

00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:13.560
I'm going to take a shower.

00:04:30.500 --> 00:04:33.500
"Love Alert" (Episode 3)

00:04:42.680 --> 00:04:44.720
Teh, what happened to your shirt?

00:04:47.880 --> 00:04:49.120
I just tripped.

00:04:50.160 --> 00:04:53.040
Give it here.
I'll wash it before the stain sets.

00:04:59.480 --> 00:05:03.240
You two go shower.
We'll check out when Fah's back.

00:05:03.960 --> 00:05:04.960
I've already packed.

00:05:05.320 --> 00:05:06.320
Yes.

00:05:19.680 --> 00:05:21.760
You can shower first.

00:05:58.120 --> 00:06:00.000
Let me help you.

00:06:01.080 --> 00:06:03.520
It's fine. I've got it.

00:06:05.040 --> 00:06:06.560
You can't win against my strength.

00:06:07.960 --> 00:06:11.200
Just tell me... where you want me to...

00:06:12.080 --> 00:06:13.160
"scrub" hard.

00:07:08.200 --> 00:07:09.200
Need a hand?

00:07:12.320 --> 00:07:13.880
What are you after?

00:07:17.520 --> 00:07:19.040
Why ask that?

00:07:20.160 --> 00:07:21.640
I just want to know.

00:07:23.280 --> 00:07:24.280
Well…

00:07:25.920 --> 00:07:28.000
I'm just a good friend…

00:07:29.040 --> 00:07:31.440
A helpful person…

00:07:32.560 --> 00:07:35.920
And someone who has… feelings for you.

00:07:41.200 --> 00:07:43.800
There's one rule of mine you should know.

00:07:47.160 --> 00:07:48.160
What rule?

00:07:50.280 --> 00:07:51.400
I don't…

00:07:57.800 --> 00:07:59.240
do “seconds.”

00:08:02.720 --> 00:08:04.920
I'll admit, you were great last night,

00:08:06.440 --> 00:08:07.440
but a rule…

00:08:08.800 --> 00:08:09.800
is a rule.

00:08:11.040 --> 00:08:12.040
Understood?

00:08:36.280 --> 00:08:37.280
Fah,

00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:41.000
let me get that for you.

00:08:41.760 --> 00:08:42.760
It's fine.

00:08:43.400 --> 00:08:44.400
Where's P'Toh?

00:08:45.360 --> 00:08:46.360
In his room.

00:08:47.280 --> 00:08:48.280
Okay.

00:09:43.520 --> 00:09:44.520
How was it?

00:09:48.760 --> 00:09:49.920
How was what?

00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:52.800
You and Fah on the very first night.

00:09:57.320 --> 00:09:58.600
You heard us?

00:10:00.120 --> 00:10:01.200
I knew you liked him,

00:10:02.040 --> 00:10:04.040
but I think it was too fast.

00:10:06.520 --> 00:10:10.040
Who told you… that I like him?

00:10:11.040 --> 00:10:12.040
Jimmy did.

00:10:15.120 --> 00:10:19.480
He told me that, so I played
wingman for you at the party.

00:10:22.080 --> 00:10:24.720
I even cleared my
schedule just to go on that trip.

00:10:28.560 --> 00:10:31.800
I thought you'd used the
chance to flirt a bit.

00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:37.160
Didn't expect you to go all in like that.

00:10:45.400 --> 00:10:46.400
P'Toh,

00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:48.000
are you sick?

00:10:48.560 --> 00:10:49.560
You're burning up.

00:10:50.080 --> 00:10:51.200
I'm not sure.

00:10:52.360 --> 00:10:53.560
I've been having chills.

00:10:54.400 --> 00:10:56.600
It's cold indoors and hot outdoors.

00:10:57.560 --> 00:10:59.480
You should take meds before it gets worse.

00:11:00.360 --> 00:11:01.360
I'll go grab some.

00:11:04.280 --> 00:11:05.280
Hang on a sec.

00:11:34.280 --> 00:11:35.280
What's your problem?

00:11:35.400 --> 00:11:37.360
Did you tell P'Toh that I like Fah?

00:11:38.680 --> 00:11:41.720
So what? I just used your name as a cover.

00:11:42.240 --> 00:11:43.680
What? You bastard!

00:11:44.400 --> 00:11:45.720
- How could you...
- I like Fah.

00:11:47.400 --> 00:11:48.880
I had to do whatever it took.

00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:51.000
At least…

00:11:51.800 --> 00:11:53.320
I made that trip happened.

00:11:54.920 --> 00:11:56.480
Even if I didn't get anywhere with him.

00:12:02.840 --> 00:12:04.160
Or do you like him too?

00:12:06.280 --> 00:12:08.000
Something felt off back at the resort.

00:12:09.600 --> 00:12:11.040
That bull crap about not sleeping...

00:12:12.600 --> 00:12:14.000
and meeting Fah to take photos.

00:12:16.760 --> 00:12:17.920
It was suspicious.

00:12:21.600 --> 00:12:23.120
What are you hiding from me?

00:12:28.960 --> 00:12:29.960
Well?

00:12:30.840 --> 00:12:31.840
Answer me!

00:12:34.280 --> 00:12:36.160
I'm not hiding anything.

00:12:37.240 --> 00:12:38.240
Just…

00:12:39.200 --> 00:12:41.440
don't use me as your excuse again, okay?

00:12:57.120 --> 00:12:58.520
Crappy friend.

00:13:21.800 --> 00:13:22.800
Fah.

00:13:24.280 --> 00:13:25.280
What are you up to?

00:13:27.400 --> 00:13:31.160
Testing a new cream
formula for sensitive skin.

00:13:33.360 --> 00:13:34.600
And what brings you here?

00:13:36.280 --> 00:13:37.760
Looking for my friends.

00:13:39.200 --> 00:13:40.560
But I can't find them.

00:14:13.560 --> 00:14:14.840
How long are you going to stare?

00:14:17.960 --> 00:14:19.080
It's good you're here.

00:14:19.960 --> 00:14:21.480
I need a guinea pig.

00:15:21.400 --> 00:15:24.120
No reaction. This formula works.

00:15:26.840 --> 00:15:30.640
How did you know I have a sensitive skin?

00:15:31.520 --> 00:15:36.160
You got a whole rash just from a mosquito
bite that night. Of course I knew.

00:15:38.680 --> 00:15:40.080
You're quite observant.

00:15:42.440 --> 00:15:45.320
In case you didn't hear me clearly…

00:15:46.520 --> 00:15:48.880
I. Don't. Do. Seconds.

00:15:49.960 --> 00:15:50.960
Now, leave.

00:15:52.800 --> 00:15:55.360
I need to focus on my work.

00:16:04.520 --> 00:16:05.520
Leave.

00:16:07.840 --> 00:16:09.080
I said I need to concentrate.

00:16:25.640 --> 00:16:26.640
Wait,

00:16:28.200 --> 00:16:30.000
can I suggest something about the cream?

00:16:31.840 --> 00:16:32.840
Go on.

00:16:34.920 --> 00:16:35.920
I think…

00:16:36.880 --> 00:16:39.640
the texture and properties are great.

00:16:40.600 --> 00:16:42.760
But maybe add a little fragrance?

00:16:43.600 --> 00:16:44.720
That would be better.

00:16:46.080 --> 00:16:48.960
The chemical smell is too strong.

00:16:50.040 --> 00:16:53.400
Thanks for the feedback. I'll look into it.

00:18:05.200 --> 00:18:07.040
Why isn't he picking up?

00:18:36.480 --> 00:18:38.320
P'Toh.

00:18:43.760 --> 00:18:45.000
Oh, Jimmy.

00:18:46.200 --> 00:18:47.240
How did you get in?

00:18:48.280 --> 00:18:49.440
Why didn't you call first?

00:18:50.320 --> 00:18:51.480
I climbed over the wall.

00:18:52.600 --> 00:18:54.080
I called you like hundred times,

00:18:54.840 --> 00:18:56.800
but you never answered.

00:18:59.400 --> 00:19:03.480
I took some allergy meds and passed out.

00:19:04.120 --> 00:19:05.120
Phone was on silent.

00:19:07.640 --> 00:19:09.960
P'Toh! You're burning up!

00:19:11.040 --> 00:19:12.520
Let's go to the hospital.

00:19:14.040 --> 00:19:15.040
I'm fine.

00:19:15.680 --> 00:19:16.840
It's just a little flu.

00:19:17.760 --> 00:19:20.560
I still have to check
the orders for the cafe.

00:19:21.480 --> 00:19:22.480
Are you serious?

00:19:23.360 --> 00:19:25.040
You're sick and still thinking about work?

00:19:32.840 --> 00:19:34.400
Jimmy? What are you doing?

00:19:35.240 --> 00:19:36.520
Taking you to your bed.

00:19:38.600 --> 00:19:39.600
Jimmy!

00:19:41.240 --> 00:19:42.240
Hold on tight.

00:20:03.440 --> 00:20:04.920
I'm quite okay now.

00:20:05.720 --> 00:20:08.600
You're still sick and don't
even go to the hospital.

00:20:09.520 --> 00:20:10.880
You're so stubborn.

00:20:14.400 --> 00:20:16.520
You're treating me like a kid.

00:20:19.520 --> 00:20:20.880
I'll treat you even more like one.

00:20:54.360 --> 00:20:55.360
Jimmy?

00:20:55.880 --> 00:20:56.880
What are you doing?

00:20:57.960 --> 00:20:59.400
Wiping you down.

00:21:02.280 --> 00:21:03.280
It's okay.

00:21:04.160 --> 00:21:05.480
I can do it myself.

00:21:08.520 --> 00:21:09.520
Are you shy?

00:21:13.280 --> 00:21:14.760
Come on, we're both guys.

00:21:23.680 --> 00:21:24.680
Jimmy!

00:21:25.040 --> 00:21:26.040
What the heck?

00:21:26.840 --> 00:21:27.960
I'll make this less awkward.

00:21:28.640 --> 00:21:31.760
I'll take my shirt off,
and you take yours off.

00:21:32.360 --> 00:21:33.480
Fair and square.

00:21:48.840 --> 00:21:49.920
Do it.

00:23:05.120 --> 00:23:06.560
Bastard Jim.

00:23:22.080 --> 00:23:23.720
Even when you're sick,

00:23:26.360 --> 00:23:27.920
you still smell so good.

00:24:29.320 --> 00:24:30.320
You...

00:24:37.280 --> 00:24:38.280
P'Toh.

00:24:38.640 --> 00:24:41.200
How are you? Feeling well now?

00:24:43.400 --> 00:24:46.320
I took those meds and it
felt like a tranquilizer shot.

00:24:47.200 --> 00:24:48.280
Didn't know what happened.

00:24:50.120 --> 00:24:51.960
Jim was looking for you.

00:24:53.200 --> 00:24:55.320
He saw me burning up,
so he wiped me down.

00:24:56.360 --> 00:24:57.360
I feel much better now.

00:25:00.400 --> 00:25:01.840
Your brother's so stubborn.

00:25:03.160 --> 00:25:04.760
He didn't want to go to the hospital,

00:25:05.440 --> 00:25:08.040
so I had to give him a quick sponge bath.

00:25:09.920 --> 00:25:10.920
Thanks.

00:25:12.000 --> 00:25:13.040
And why are you here?

00:25:14.360 --> 00:25:17.760
You forgot your shoes in my car.
I just returned them to you.

00:25:20.040 --> 00:25:22.200
P'Toh, your brother's here.

00:25:23.000 --> 00:25:25.080
Well… I'm leaving now.

00:25:27.800 --> 00:25:28.960
Thanks, Jim.

00:25:37.800 --> 00:25:40.200
Get some meds for P'Toh. I'm going.

00:25:45.040 --> 00:25:46.280
I'll be back.

00:25:53.960 --> 00:25:54.960
Hey.

00:25:57.360 --> 00:25:58.760
I put your shoes there.

00:26:03.800 --> 00:26:04.800
Jimmy.

00:26:06.840 --> 00:26:07.840
What?

00:26:09.960 --> 00:26:12.360
Thanks for looking after my brother.

00:26:13.240 --> 00:26:14.240
And…

00:26:14.480 --> 00:26:15.480
And what?

00:26:17.240 --> 00:26:21.080
Sorry for snapping at you about him.

00:26:24.960 --> 00:26:27.320
You brother-obsessed freak.

00:26:27.880 --> 00:26:29.480
Your brother is like my brother.

00:26:32.080 --> 00:26:33.520
I never betray anyone.

00:26:36.480 --> 00:26:37.800
You're my best friend.

00:26:38.600 --> 00:26:39.600
Yeah.

00:26:42.760 --> 00:26:45.640
Get meds for P'Toh, or
he'll do his work again.

00:26:46.360 --> 00:26:47.520
You'd better go.

00:26:49.440 --> 00:26:50.440
I'm off.

00:26:54.400 --> 00:26:55.679
Hey, safe driving.

00:26:55.680 --> 00:26:56.680
Yep!

00:26:58.360 --> 00:27:00.320
You're too slow for me, traitor.

00:27:21.960 --> 00:27:24.320
How's my cooking?

00:27:24.920 --> 00:27:26.360
Delicious.

00:27:31.240 --> 00:27:34.400
Didn't know my brother was a pro.

00:27:35.840 --> 00:27:37.680
Nice work, YouTube chef.

00:27:38.120 --> 00:27:39.480
Naturally.

00:27:40.720 --> 00:27:42.200
Just order whatever you want.

00:27:43.320 --> 00:27:44.840
Why tire yourself out?

00:27:48.280 --> 00:27:49.280
And…

00:27:49.960 --> 00:27:53.240
don't forget to take
your meds after the meal.

00:28:11.920 --> 00:28:12.920
P'Toh.

00:28:16.600 --> 00:28:18.800
Did Jimmy just wipe you down?

00:28:20.800 --> 00:28:22.000
Where is this coming from?

00:28:23.520 --> 00:28:26.520
I'm just worried about you.

00:28:28.280 --> 00:28:29.960
You saw it. It was nothing.

00:28:30.880 --> 00:28:33.320
Why don't you trust us?

00:28:36.640 --> 00:28:38.880
I don't want you to fall for Jimmy

00:28:39.640 --> 00:28:41.080
and see you get hurt.

00:28:43.240 --> 00:28:46.640
I've been his friend for a long time.
I know exactly what he's capable of.

00:28:48.280 --> 00:28:51.960
Why worry about me?
You should worry about yourself.

00:28:54.600 --> 00:28:56.360
And what's wrong with me?

00:28:58.160 --> 00:29:02.320
Do you realize you haven't
been yourself since the trip?

00:29:05.120 --> 00:29:06.400
What do you mean?

00:29:08.560 --> 00:29:09.560
I don't know.

00:29:11.320 --> 00:29:15.200
But I know you're hiding something from me.

00:29:16.000 --> 00:29:17.000
Right?

00:29:17.840 --> 00:29:20.520
No! I'm gonna wash dishes now.

00:29:23.880 --> 00:29:25.080
So suspicious.

00:29:27.440 --> 00:29:29.960
Tell me when you're ready.

00:30:06.640 --> 00:30:08.440
“What are you doing?”

00:30:15.640 --> 00:30:20.640
(Teh: What are you doing?)

00:30:24.560 --> 00:30:28.600
(Teh: What are you doing? (Read))

00:30:37.120 --> 00:30:42.360
(Fah: Hanging out with friends.)

00:30:45.240 --> 00:30:46.920
“Have fun.

00:30:48.320 --> 00:30:51.400
Let me know if you need a ride home.”

00:30:51.840 --> 00:30:58.960
(Teh: Have fun. Let me know
if you need a ride home.)

00:31:15.160 --> 00:31:20.640
(Jimmy: What are you doing?)

00:32:05.920 --> 00:32:07.040
What's up?

00:32:07.400 --> 00:32:09.680
I'm thinking of asking Fah out tonight.

00:32:10.880 --> 00:32:13.120
Don't bother. He's out with his friends.

00:32:13.520 --> 00:32:14.520
How would you know that?

00:32:16.400 --> 00:32:17.400
I mean…

00:32:18.480 --> 00:32:21.120
It's Friday.
Everyone's out with their friends, right?

00:32:22.320 --> 00:32:23.320
True.

00:32:24.240 --> 00:32:27.960
I'll try my luck anyway. I messaged
him, but he hasn't read it yet.

00:32:29.280 --> 00:32:32.439
Just leave him alone.
He's busy with his friends.

00:32:32.440 --> 00:32:36.120
I'm heading to bed. Feeling a bit drowsy.
I might have caught P'Toh's cold.

00:32:50.440 --> 00:32:52.240
You started this game, Teh.

00:33:31.680 --> 00:33:33.000
Get well soon.

00:33:34.440 --> 00:33:35.440
I'm worried about you.

00:33:36.600 --> 00:33:40.760
Take care of this little guy.
It's much better behaved than I am.

00:33:41.560 --> 00:33:42.560
Jimmy.

00:34:49.920 --> 00:34:51.720
Guess who?

00:34:54.600 --> 00:34:56.360
What's my prize if I win?

00:34:57.840 --> 00:34:58.840
Guess…

00:34:59.480 --> 00:35:01.880
Guess first. Then we'll talk.

00:35:06.720 --> 00:35:08.200
Plaifah.

00:35:09.240 --> 00:35:11.840
Ugh, No fun. How do you know?

00:35:14.280 --> 00:35:15.600
I remember your scent.

00:35:16.840 --> 00:35:18.680
Did you graduate from the K-9 academy?

00:35:20.720 --> 00:35:22.360
Give me your paw.

00:35:24.560 --> 00:35:25.640
Happy now?

00:35:27.800 --> 00:35:30.200
So, what brings you here?

00:35:33.280 --> 00:35:35.399
Remember when you were my guinea pig…

00:35:35.400 --> 00:35:36.999
I mean, my victim…

00:35:37.000 --> 00:35:39.040
Guinea pig was right.

00:35:39.520 --> 00:35:41.320
You're actually pretty funny.

00:35:41.680 --> 00:35:45.120
Anyway, I got a perfect
score on that formula.

00:35:46.160 --> 00:35:47.240
So I thought…

00:35:48.040 --> 00:35:49.680
I'd treat you to a meal.

00:35:52.400 --> 00:35:53.520
Pick any place you want.

00:35:54.560 --> 00:35:55.840
It's on me.

00:36:00.040 --> 00:36:01.440
Deal.

00:36:02.800 --> 00:36:04.880
Can I really do that?

00:36:06.800 --> 00:36:07.800
Yes, you can.

00:36:38.040 --> 00:36:39.120
I'll help you.

00:36:57.800 --> 00:37:00.720
I let you choose a restaurant,
but you chose hard labor.

00:37:04.240 --> 00:37:07.360
We can go to a restaurant anytime.

00:37:08.040 --> 00:37:12.200
But having a meal cooked
by you? That's a rare chance.

00:37:12.920 --> 00:37:13.920
True.

00:37:14.960 --> 00:37:16.880
You're the first person
to ever set foot in here.

00:37:18.480 --> 00:37:19.480
Really?

00:37:20.280 --> 00:37:22.840
Usually, I'd go to their place or a hotel.

00:37:23.680 --> 00:37:26.160
I don't like people intruding
on my personal space.

00:37:26.840 --> 00:37:28.120
They'll get ahead of themselves.

00:37:29.960 --> 00:37:31.840
I'm truly honored.

00:37:32.680 --> 00:37:33.680
Whatever.

00:37:33.960 --> 00:37:37.440
If it wasn't for my cream,
you'd never be here.

00:37:41.160 --> 00:37:43.519
I'm so grateful. Thank you so much.

00:37:43.520 --> 00:37:44.520
That's my head.

00:37:48.240 --> 00:37:49.280
Stop playing around.

00:37:50.800 --> 00:37:51.960
Are you going to finish that?

00:37:52.920 --> 00:37:55.800
Your chopping is sloppy. Can you even cook?

00:37:56.960 --> 00:37:58.000
Keep chopping them.

00:37:58.720 --> 00:38:03.920
P'Toh does all the cooking.
I just eat whatever he makes.

00:38:05.840 --> 00:38:07.440
If you want my cooking,

00:38:08.440 --> 00:38:09.720
you have to earn it.

00:38:10.360 --> 00:38:11.440
Get back to chopping.

00:38:14.320 --> 00:38:15.920
We're making curry, not mashed potatoes.

00:38:34.240 --> 00:38:35.760
Here's your coffee, mister customer.

00:38:36.600 --> 00:38:37.880
In the cafe's cup.

00:38:39.560 --> 00:38:40.560
Thank you.

00:38:44.320 --> 00:38:45.640
The coffee's great as always.

00:38:46.400 --> 00:38:47.400
And the cup…

00:38:48.480 --> 00:38:49.560
has a drawing of me on it.

00:38:50.920 --> 00:38:54.440
I was thinking of drawing the customers
on every cup when it's not too busy.

00:38:54.960 --> 00:38:55.960
What do you think?

00:38:56.600 --> 00:38:57.720
It's a good idea.

00:38:59.040 --> 00:39:01.440
It can be your cafe's signature.

00:39:05.760 --> 00:39:07.680
But can your “staff” draw like you do?

00:39:09.280 --> 00:39:10.320
That's the hard part.

00:39:43.600 --> 00:39:45.000
It's delicious.

00:39:46.880 --> 00:39:47.880
Are you flattering me?

00:39:49.320 --> 00:39:51.680
I bet it's not as good as Toh's.

00:39:55.360 --> 00:39:56.880
It's a different kind of delicious.

00:39:57.720 --> 00:39:58.720
Smooth answer.

00:40:00.600 --> 00:40:01.880
Actually,

00:40:02.720 --> 00:40:04.160
I wanted to say…

00:40:05.000 --> 00:40:06.560
It's as tasty as the chef.

00:40:10.960 --> 00:40:11.960
Watch it.

00:40:13.680 --> 00:40:14.680
See?

00:40:15.320 --> 00:40:17.160
I knew I'd get that reaction.

00:40:42.080 --> 00:40:44.600
I might not be good at drawing like you do,

00:40:50.760 --> 00:40:52.240
but I want them to have a partner.

00:42:07.120 --> 00:42:08.400
That…

00:42:09.160 --> 00:42:10.840
That was my first kiss…

00:42:11.480 --> 00:42:14.000
I'm not sure how to…

00:42:14.240 --> 00:42:15.240
It's okay.

00:42:17.200 --> 00:42:18.480
I'll take the lead.

00:42:53.640 --> 00:42:54.720
What's on your mind?

00:42:57.360 --> 00:42:59.200
Remember when you covered my eyes?

00:43:02.480 --> 00:43:05.640
I asked what I'd get if I won,

00:43:05.880 --> 00:43:08.280
and you told me to guess right first.

00:43:11.280 --> 00:43:13.800
Yeah, and I treated you to dinner.

00:43:15.360 --> 00:43:17.440
That was for the cream. This is different.

00:43:18.800 --> 00:43:20.040
What are you asking for?

00:43:27.240 --> 00:43:28.880
Can you drop the…

00:43:30.840 --> 00:43:32.280
“no seconds” rule?

00:43:38.880 --> 00:43:40.080
I'm really into you.

00:43:47.920 --> 00:43:50.000
But I'm a man of my word.

00:43:54.960 --> 00:43:55.960
Then…

00:43:57.640 --> 00:43:59.760
I'm sorry...

00:44:08.960 --> 00:44:09.960
But every rule…

00:44:11.840 --> 00:44:13.120
has an exception.

00:47:51.160 --> 00:47:54.440
How can I say that I slept with
the guy my friend has feelings for?

00:47:55.240 --> 00:47:57.360
Damn it!

00:47:58.760 --> 00:48:00.040
Jimmy likes you.

00:48:03.280 --> 00:48:04.760
But I don't like him.

00:48:09.520 --> 00:48:11.360
Fah doesn't like Jimmy back anyway.

00:48:14.040 --> 00:48:17.720
Screw it. I'll apologize to Jimmy
after I can win Fah over.

00:48:25.160 --> 00:48:30.040
(Next Episode) I hope you'll do the same
for me. Or at least… don't break my heart.

00:48:31.640 --> 00:48:33.239
Punch me if you have the balls!

00:48:33.240 --> 00:48:33.920
You bastard!

00:48:34.080 --> 00:48:36.280
I also hope that you'll…

00:48:37.000 --> 00:48:38.040
stay away from Fah.

00:48:38.200 --> 00:48:40.560
If you don't want your brother
suicidal from a broken heart,

00:48:41.160 --> 00:48:42.560
you'd better keep your mouth shut.

00:48:43.200 --> 00:48:44.960
I'm telling you again.

00:48:45.480 --> 00:48:46.880
Jimmy's incapable of loving anyone.
