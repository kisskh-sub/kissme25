WEBVTT

00:01:53.800 --> 00:01:54.729
My Lord! My Lord!

00:01:54.880 --> 00:01:55.440
I'm here

00:01:55.640 --> 00:01:56.800
I invited you here today

00:01:56.800 --> 00:01:58.240
to tell you

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:01.080
that I've been hiding for years.

00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:40.520
Depiao

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:42.079
Come on.

00:02:44.960 --> 00:02:47.890
Here's your mother's incense. Thank you. Thank you.

00:03:10.960 --> 00:03:11.920
All these years,

00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:16.079
I've been telling you

00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:18.370
your mother died young.

00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:20.650
and was buried in her hometown.

00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:23.400
Today,

00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:26.640
I'll tell you

00:03:28.240 --> 00:03:29.640
about your mother.

00:03:31.240 --> 00:03:33.040
Your mother's name is Lv Ji.

00:03:34.360 --> 00:03:37.960
She used to be a famous dancer in Chang'an.

00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:40.920
Twenty years ago,

00:03:42.480 --> 00:03:43.960
I met your mother.

00:03:44.240 --> 00:03:45.840
I fell in love at first sight.

00:03:46.520 --> 00:03:47.840
and got engaged.

00:03:49.640 --> 00:03:51.800
And she had a regular guest.

00:03:52.200 --> 00:03:53.079
At that time,

00:03:53.920 --> 00:03:55.560
took over your mother.

00:03:58.240 --> 00:03:59.079
Soon,

00:04:00.120 --> 00:04:01.360
she was pregnant.

00:04:02.520 --> 00:04:03.520
I'm weak.

00:04:05.240 --> 00:04:08.080
The doctor said if she doesn't want this child,

00:04:08.920 --> 00:04:10.650
she might not be able to hold on.

00:04:10.960 --> 00:04:13.220
Why don't you give birth to her? Let's go.

00:04:13.800 --> 00:04:14.640
Besides,

00:04:15.680 --> 00:04:17.959
she doesn't have much life left.

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:21.120
I hope to keep Lu'er's child.

00:04:23.120 --> 00:04:24.800
Even if it's not my own child,

00:04:26.120 --> 00:04:27.980
as long as it's Green'er's blood,

00:04:29.760 --> 00:04:32.560
just like she's by my side.

00:04:33.880 --> 00:04:34.680
Deok-biao.

00:04:35.240 --> 00:04:36.370
After you were born,

00:04:36.520 --> 00:04:37.760
I'll do my best

00:04:38.120 --> 00:04:39.640
to give you a good life.

00:04:40.520 --> 00:04:41.360
Your mother

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:43.640
had no choice in her life.

00:04:45.560 --> 00:04:46.420
As your father,

00:04:47.760 --> 00:04:50.960
I hope you can be safe and healthy forever.

00:04:52.120 --> 00:04:52.880
Everything

00:04:54.120 --> 00:04:55.320
Let it be.

00:04:56.520 --> 00:04:57.320
People say

00:04:58.800 --> 00:05:00.440
a woman's talent is virtue.

00:05:01.240 --> 00:05:02.080
De Biao,

00:05:03.200 --> 00:05:04.360
You like reading?

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:06.930
I'll support you

00:05:07.440 --> 00:05:09.000
support you to study.

00:05:09.960 --> 00:05:11.690
You like to be a female teacher.

00:05:12.680 --> 00:05:13.520
I

00:05:14.240 --> 00:05:16.200
support you to be a female teacher.

00:05:20.680 --> 00:05:21.520
Lyuer.

00:05:23.960 --> 00:05:25.560
The child has grown up.

00:05:26.320 --> 00:05:26.960
I

00:05:28.560 --> 00:05:30.360
I didn't dare to say this before.

00:05:30.680 --> 00:05:33.440
because I didn't want the kids to hear it.

00:05:34.120 --> 00:05:34.880
Now,

00:05:35.680 --> 00:05:37.880
the child knows the situation.

00:05:40.800 --> 00:05:41.640
And you

00:05:43.440 --> 00:05:44.680
is gone.

00:05:46.080 --> 00:05:46.880
But love

00:05:49.080 --> 00:05:49.940
is still there.

00:05:52.360 --> 00:05:53.200
I

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:55.440
never regret

00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:57.460
fighting against my life.

00:05:58.200 --> 00:05:59.000
I

00:06:00.200 --> 00:06:03.080
[I'm most proud of.]

00:06:06.640 --> 00:06:09.200
First, our child, De Biao,

00:06:09.560 --> 00:06:10.880
is unparalleled.

00:06:11.800 --> 00:06:12.640
Second,

00:06:13.680 --> 00:06:14.440
I

00:06:16.440 --> 00:06:17.700
fight with the heaven.

00:06:19.560 --> 00:06:20.680
Fight with fate

00:06:21.880 --> 00:06:25.080
for the relationship with you.

00:06:29.680 --> 00:06:30.440
I have

00:06:31.360 --> 00:06:33.240
have gone beyond the heavenly will.

00:06:33.240 --> 00:06:33.880
De Biao,

00:06:35.960 --> 00:06:37.120
I hope you can

00:06:39.760 --> 00:06:41.200
fight with your life.

00:06:43.880 --> 00:06:45.880
[Fight for your life!]

00:06:49.320 --> 00:06:50.120
Lu'er.

00:06:51.320 --> 00:06:52.800
In the underworld,

00:06:53.080 --> 00:06:54.520
in the underworld.

00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:56.320
I can rest in peace.

00:07:35.960 --> 00:07:37.640
After Lord Xu recovers,

00:07:38.560 --> 00:07:40.690
he will leave the mansion eventually.

00:07:41.880 --> 00:07:43.880
It's still uncertain

00:07:44.680 --> 00:07:45.880
is still unknown.

00:07:47.360 --> 00:07:49.800
Your Excellency, when you proposed,

00:07:50.320 --> 00:07:52.320
you've alarmed the whole Chang'an.

00:07:53.680 --> 00:07:54.800
If Miss Li

00:07:55.360 --> 00:07:56.680
leave with Lord Xu,

00:07:59.120 --> 00:08:01.000
I don't have much time left.

00:08:02.200 --> 00:08:02.800
My lord.

00:08:03.880 --> 00:08:05.120
I have a suggestion.

00:08:06.760 --> 00:08:07.820
As the saying goes,

00:08:08.120 --> 00:08:09.780
know yourself and your enemy.

00:08:10.320 --> 00:08:11.760
and win every battle.

00:08:14.360 --> 00:08:16.000
Lord Xu's heart...

00:08:18.200 --> 00:08:19.000
Lord Xu,

00:08:20.440 --> 00:08:22.560
It's time to find out.

00:09:03.440 --> 00:09:06.040
What are they doing?

00:09:09.080 --> 00:09:09.920
Zheng.

00:09:20.720 --> 00:09:21.960
You scared me.

00:09:24.080 --> 00:09:25.720
Are you okay?

00:09:30.320 --> 00:09:32.180
Let me apply the medicine for you.

00:09:34.080 --> 00:09:35.040
Separate hatred.

00:09:35.040 --> 00:09:36.440
Your nose

00:09:36.440 --> 00:09:38.400
is stung by bees.

00:09:38.480 --> 00:09:38.920
No.

00:09:39.280 --> 00:09:42.280
No need. Brother Xu is badly injured.

00:09:42.400 --> 00:09:43.800
I have to apply medicine on him.

00:09:43.800 --> 00:09:44.730
Don't come over.

00:09:44.800 --> 00:09:46.320
Women should avoid suspicion.

00:09:46.320 --> 00:09:46.960
Let's go.

00:09:47.800 --> 00:09:48.800
Avoid suspicion.

00:09:50.480 --> 00:09:51.280
I'll go check.

00:09:57.560 --> 00:09:58.920
You need to avoid suspicion.

00:09:58.920 --> 00:09:59.920
Avoid suspicion?

00:10:23.200 --> 00:10:24.080
At this point,

00:10:25.440 --> 00:10:26.560
you're here again.

00:10:26.840 --> 00:10:29.440
It's better to be honest

00:10:29.960 --> 00:10:30.800
to be honest.

00:10:32.800 --> 00:10:34.060
It's about Kou, right?

00:10:34.280 --> 00:10:34.800
Yes.

00:10:39.560 --> 00:10:40.400
Ziqi

00:10:41.200 --> 00:10:42.160
I like Zheng.

00:10:42.600 --> 00:10:43.860
And I want to marry her.

00:10:44.320 --> 00:10:45.780
I already proposed to her.

00:10:46.440 --> 00:10:47.560
You were there? Yes.

00:10:47.560 --> 00:10:48.280
Li,

00:10:48.960 --> 00:10:50.040
I was there too.

00:10:50.400 --> 00:10:51.480
You did propose.

00:10:51.800 --> 00:10:53.400
But she didn't agree.

00:10:55.680 --> 00:10:56.440
So,

00:10:57.960 --> 00:10:59.840
you want to snatch the crown from me?

00:10:59.840 --> 00:11:00.680
No.

00:11:01.480 --> 00:11:02.560
Fair competition.

00:11:02.800 --> 00:11:03.960
Fair competition.

00:11:04.440 --> 00:11:05.640
A gentleman's fight.

00:11:07.800 --> 00:11:08.560
Deal.

00:11:09.920 --> 00:11:11.080
I won't let you go.

00:11:20.440 --> 00:11:21.560
You may leave now.

00:11:22.200 --> 00:11:22.920
Yes.

00:11:31.920 --> 00:11:32.980
Yes, sir. Yes, sir.

00:11:36.440 --> 00:11:37.200
My Lord.

00:11:38.080 --> 00:11:39.410
I searched everywhere,

00:11:39.680 --> 00:11:41.140
but no assassin was found.

00:11:41.840 --> 00:11:42.840
This crossbow...

00:11:42.960 --> 00:11:43.800
Lord Xu.

00:11:44.160 --> 00:11:46.720
We've got the delinquents to investigate carefully.

00:11:46.720 --> 00:11:47.560
Lord Xu said

00:11:47.840 --> 00:11:48.720
the armory

00:11:48.920 --> 00:11:51.400
has registered all the iron mine in Tang.

00:11:51.960 --> 00:11:53.420
The arrow of this crossbow

00:11:53.440 --> 00:11:54.970
is indeed made of iron mine.

00:11:55.320 --> 00:11:57.440
But from weight and purity,

00:11:58.160 --> 00:12:00.480
are not made by folk craftsmanship.

00:12:02.800 --> 00:12:03.930
Who else could it be?

00:12:04.400 --> 00:12:05.560
The four elders.

00:12:07.440 --> 00:12:09.560
The arrow shot

00:12:09.920 --> 00:12:10.980
was Hua Xiao Zheng.

00:12:12.320 --> 00:12:14.580
Xiao Zheng has repeatedly offended you.

00:12:14.960 --> 00:12:17.760
I'm afraid she can't tolerate Xiao Zheng anymore.

00:12:18.080 --> 00:12:20.480
But he chose to do this in my mansion

00:12:23.160 --> 00:12:24.200
to frame me

00:12:24.800 --> 00:12:25.720
or to remind me

00:12:26.680 --> 00:12:28.160
that both adults

00:12:28.440 --> 00:12:29.500
are both in danger.

00:12:32.080 --> 00:12:33.410
What are you going to do?

00:12:36.200 --> 00:12:38.200
Since you don't want to be the Oiran,

00:12:38.800 --> 00:12:39.560
let’s

00:12:39.680 --> 00:12:42.340
her relationship with the Chamber of Commerce.

00:12:42.680 --> 00:12:44.840
The four elders won’t hold a grudge

00:12:45.200 --> 00:12:45.960
a woman.

00:12:47.720 --> 00:12:48.920
Look at this. Look at this.

00:12:48.920 --> 00:12:49.780
what about you?

00:12:52.800 --> 00:12:53.860
It's never too late

00:12:54.960 --> 00:12:56.090
It's never too late.

00:12:57.320 --> 00:12:58.320
The assassin

00:12:58.440 --> 00:13:00.320
When he heard your name,

00:13:00.320 --> 00:13:02.920
he was so scared that he confessed everything.

00:13:03.200 --> 00:13:04.040
Where did he

00:13:04.320 --> 00:13:06.320
told him to assassinate you?

00:13:06.960 --> 00:13:07.720
And...

00:13:08.400 --> 00:13:09.530
How was the weather?

00:13:10.320 --> 00:13:12.480
Even the color of the bag containing silver

00:13:12.480 --> 00:13:14.080
the color of loading silver.

00:13:17.400 --> 00:13:20.000
The Chamber of Commerce can't wait any longer.

00:13:21.440 --> 00:13:22.960
I guess the assassins

00:13:23.160 --> 00:13:24.820
who tried to kill me recently.

00:13:24.960 --> 00:13:26.680
How is the assassin?

00:13:29.200 --> 00:13:30.080
As you ordered,

00:13:30.440 --> 00:13:32.080
we found a dead body

00:13:32.200 --> 00:13:33.320
in the prison.

00:13:33.560 --> 00:13:34.400
and said

00:13:34.800 --> 00:13:37.060
he committed suicide while chasing him.

00:13:37.200 --> 00:13:39.040
The other brothers escorted the assassin

00:13:39.040 --> 00:13:40.640
and his family left the city.

00:13:40.800 --> 00:13:42.930
The Chamber of Commerce can't find it.

00:13:45.560 --> 00:13:46.400
Xu Ziqi!

00:13:47.800 --> 00:13:48.440
Xu Ziqi, go!

00:13:48.440 --> 00:13:49.700
Go through the window.

00:13:58.400 --> 00:13:59.680
What are you doing?

00:14:02.680 --> 00:14:03.200
Well...

00:14:03.320 --> 00:14:04.650
I'm going out for a walk.

00:14:04.800 --> 00:14:06.280
See if my wound is healed.

00:14:07.040 --> 00:14:08.440
Is your wound better?

00:14:10.560 --> 00:14:13.840
Is my wound better?

00:14:17.080 --> 00:14:18.440
What's wrong?

00:14:19.960 --> 00:14:20.680
It hurts.

00:14:20.960 --> 00:14:21.560
It hurts.

00:14:21.680 --> 00:14:23.680
Go back to your room and rest.

00:14:24.600 --> 00:14:25.440
Take care.

00:14:26.200 --> 00:14:26.440
Be careful.

00:14:26.440 --> 00:14:27.040
It hurts.

00:14:36.320 --> 00:14:37.320
Does it hurt a lot?

00:14:41.920 --> 00:14:44.680
Will it take you a long time to recover?

00:14:45.320 --> 00:14:46.160
About...

00:14:48.080 --> 00:14:49.960
about ten days and a half months.

00:14:53.960 --> 00:14:55.690
Only ten days and a half months.

00:14:57.920 --> 00:14:59.080
When you recover,

00:15:01.080 --> 00:15:02.720
Are you leaving the mansion?

00:15:05.440 --> 00:15:06.560
My heart hurts.

00:15:08.480 --> 00:15:09.440
My heart hurts.

00:15:20.600 --> 00:15:22.040
You know that

00:15:23.320 --> 00:15:24.320
I like you.

00:15:40.440 --> 00:15:41.300
What about now?

00:15:42.960 --> 00:15:44.160
Now you know

00:15:47.400 --> 00:15:48.200
Now

00:15:49.960 --> 00:15:50.960
you know.

00:15:52.680 --> 00:15:54.810
I know about the separation of hatred.

00:15:55.680 --> 00:15:56.440
Now,

00:15:57.720 --> 00:15:58.920
I have only one way.

00:16:12.600 --> 00:16:13.800
I can only chase you.

00:16:23.720 --> 00:16:24.720
You have to reply.

00:16:30.840 --> 00:16:31.800
I...

00:16:33.560 --> 00:16:35.490
I've never been in a relationship.

00:16:35.920 --> 00:16:37.960
I'm a girl.

00:16:40.160 --> 00:16:41.360
I have no experience.

00:16:53.560 --> 00:16:55.160
Calm down.

00:16:56.680 --> 00:16:57.200
I...

00:17:06.200 --> 00:17:06.960
Zheng.

00:17:08.640 --> 00:17:10.520
I can't breathe.

00:17:11.520 --> 00:17:12.650
Don't stimulate me.

00:17:13.760 --> 00:17:14.400
You...

00:17:16.440 --> 00:17:18.960
You're usually so fierce.

00:17:19.200 --> 00:17:21.329
I'm telling you something important.

00:17:21.440 --> 00:17:22.640
Why are you so tired?

00:17:24.520 --> 00:17:25.359
Am I?

00:17:26.599 --> 00:17:27.520
I'm not.

00:17:32.720 --> 00:17:33.680
I'm not.

00:17:34.440 --> 00:17:35.700
I was so tired just now.

00:17:42.440 --> 00:17:43.200
Zheng.

00:17:43.520 --> 00:17:44.640
Don't talk to me.

00:17:45.440 --> 00:17:46.680
I need to calm down.

00:17:47.200 --> 00:17:48.680
and think about life.

00:17:55.480 --> 00:17:56.440
Stop it.

00:17:57.480 --> 00:17:59.680
I'm thinking about something serious.

00:18:10.840 --> 00:18:12.240
There are a few questions

00:18:12.280 --> 00:18:13.840
some questions first.

00:18:14.200 --> 00:18:15.660
Look at this. Look at this.

00:18:16.360 --> 00:18:17.160
Well...

00:18:18.040 --> 00:18:21.170
Do you have an important position in the imperial court?

00:18:24.480 --> 00:18:25.280
No.

00:18:26.480 --> 00:18:27.280
Then,

00:18:27.640 --> 00:18:29.880
Do you have a lot of money?

00:18:31.200 --> 00:18:32.200
You know.

00:18:32.960 --> 00:18:34.360
I'm so poor.

00:18:37.160 --> 00:18:41.360
So you don't have any merits

00:18:42.720 --> 00:18:44.280
you have no merits.

00:18:45.680 --> 00:18:46.920
Isn't that enough?

00:18:48.880 --> 00:18:50.160
Not enough.

00:18:51.600 --> 00:18:52.400
Then...

00:18:54.480 --> 00:18:55.520
Do you like me?

00:18:57.000 --> 00:18:57.840
Do you

00:18:58.480 --> 00:18:59.520
love me?

00:19:05.480 --> 00:19:06.840
You're blushing.

00:19:07.400 --> 00:19:08.200
So you do.

00:19:11.440 --> 00:19:12.600
Even if you do,

00:19:12.960 --> 00:19:15.480
You don't have a position or money.

00:19:16.680 --> 00:19:19.720
I need to think about it.

00:19:20.960 --> 00:19:21.960
You can chase him.

00:19:22.280 --> 00:19:23.880
But it's a question

00:19:24.240 --> 00:19:25.440
That's a problem.

00:19:27.520 --> 00:19:28.480
Didn't you say

00:19:29.120 --> 00:19:30.040
the most important feeling

00:19:30.040 --> 00:19:31.760
when two people are together?

00:19:33.280 --> 00:19:35.480
Sometimes there are exceptions.

00:19:42.000 --> 00:19:42.960
Are you serious?

00:19:45.400 --> 00:19:46.120
I mean,

00:19:46.960 --> 00:19:47.960
I need money

00:19:48.360 --> 00:19:49.240
and power.

00:19:49.600 --> 00:19:52.400
Otherwise, I might not be able to catch up with you.

00:19:52.680 --> 00:19:55.480
I think so.

00:19:58.600 --> 00:20:00.640
Why do you talk so much about me?

00:20:00.760 --> 00:20:01.840
It's another standard

00:20:01.840 --> 00:20:03.160
another standard.

00:20:03.960 --> 00:20:05.840
My situation is different.

00:20:05.920 --> 00:20:07.250
What's the difference?

00:20:07.480 --> 00:20:08.480
You're not human.

00:20:10.440 --> 00:20:11.280
Or

00:20:12.000 --> 00:20:14.960
can you think about it?

00:20:15.440 --> 00:20:16.520
and try?

00:20:21.680 --> 00:20:22.480
Then tell me.

00:20:23.160 --> 00:20:24.480
How much money do I need to make?

00:20:24.480 --> 00:20:26.010
How much time do you give me?

00:20:26.040 --> 00:20:26.880
Just...

00:20:27.720 --> 00:20:28.840
I'm rich.

00:20:29.280 --> 00:20:30.280
and rich.

00:20:32.200 --> 00:20:33.440
Time

00:20:34.200 --> 00:20:35.530
The sooner, the better.

00:20:35.600 --> 00:20:36.680
In that case,

00:20:37.040 --> 00:20:38.600
I might as well rob the bank.

00:20:38.720 --> 00:20:40.050
Robbing is not allowed.

00:20:40.160 --> 00:20:41.480
Robbing is temporary.

00:20:41.720 --> 00:20:43.250
You have to be rich forever.

00:20:44.960 --> 00:20:46.400
That's a good idea.

00:20:46.960 --> 00:20:48.520
I should think about

00:20:48.680 --> 00:20:50.410
what kind of man I should marry.

00:21:17.520 --> 00:21:19.440
I like rich and powerful men.

00:21:20.600 --> 00:21:21.660
Is there a problem?

00:21:22.000 --> 00:21:24.660
Is it wrong for me to think for the rest of my life?

00:21:24.840 --> 00:21:26.880
You didn't even try to pursue me.

00:21:28.120 --> 00:21:29.780
What kind of attitude is that?

00:21:33.440 --> 00:21:36.640
Your Excellency, Mr. Xu will lose for sure.

00:21:40.440 --> 00:21:42.100
Have you given instructions?

00:21:42.680 --> 00:21:43.680
Yes.

00:21:43.840 --> 00:21:44.570
Don't worry.

00:21:56.840 --> 00:21:57.640
Hello, Madam.

00:22:02.680 --> 00:22:03.440
I'm not.

00:22:03.760 --> 00:22:04.560
Hello, Madam.

00:22:07.280 --> 00:22:08.440
Hello Madam

00:22:09.040 --> 00:22:10.200
Hello Madam

00:22:10.840 --> 00:22:11.720
Don't bow

00:22:12.120 --> 00:22:13.040
Hello, madam.

00:22:13.480 --> 00:22:14.210
My goodness.

00:22:17.960 --> 00:22:18.840
Hello, madam.

00:22:23.040 --> 00:22:23.880
Hello, Madam.

00:22:26.400 --> 00:22:27.200
How is it, Xu?

00:22:28.400 --> 00:22:29.200
See?

00:22:29.840 --> 00:22:32.200
She's Mrs. Fang now.

00:22:36.640 --> 00:22:38.300
Xiao Zheng hasn't agreed yet.

00:22:38.520 --> 00:22:39.960
before she agrees.

00:22:40.440 --> 00:22:41.280
without moral ethics.

00:22:41.280 --> 00:22:42.540
No matter what you say,

00:22:43.000 --> 00:22:45.330
Madam Fang's name has already been known.

00:22:45.680 --> 00:22:47.680
I'm just taking the initiative.

00:22:49.200 --> 00:22:49.640
By then,

00:22:49.640 --> 00:22:51.880
if he doesn't agree to your title,

00:22:52.040 --> 00:22:52.970
and promised me,

00:22:53.040 --> 00:22:54.440
Aren't you going to change

00:22:54.440 --> 00:22:55.640
must be replaced.

00:23:00.880 --> 00:23:01.680
Hello, Madam.

00:23:01.880 --> 00:23:02.720
I'm not.

00:23:02.720 --> 00:23:03.440
Hello, Madam.

00:23:03.440 --> 00:23:04.200
I'm not.

00:23:04.480 --> 00:23:05.280
Hello, Madam.

00:23:05.280 --> 00:23:05.840
I'm not.

00:23:05.840 --> 00:23:06.640
Hello, Madam.

00:23:06.680 --> 00:23:07.600
I'm really not...

00:23:07.600 --> 00:23:08.400
Hello, madam.

00:23:08.640 --> 00:23:09.440
Stop yelling.

00:23:09.680 --> 00:23:10.040
Hello, madam.

00:23:10.040 --> 00:23:11.240
I'm not your wife.

00:23:11.400 --> 00:23:12.280
Hello, madam.

00:23:12.400 --> 00:23:13.280
Stop bowing.

00:23:13.680 --> 00:23:14.480
Hello, madam.

00:23:14.600 --> 00:23:15.360
I'm really not...

00:23:15.360 --> 00:23:16.160
Hello, madam.

00:23:16.200 --> 00:23:17.360
I'm really not your wife.

00:23:17.360 --> 00:23:18.160
Hello, madam.

00:23:18.200 --> 00:23:19.460
Stop calling me madam.

00:23:27.960 --> 00:23:28.720
Zheng.

00:23:29.200 --> 00:23:30.880
Answer the questions.

00:23:31.520 --> 00:23:32.960
Add it to my family tree.

00:23:33.480 --> 00:23:36.240
There are many things that need to be asked in detail.

00:23:36.240 --> 00:23:37.170
The family book.

00:23:37.200 --> 00:23:39.880
Miss Hua, what's your birth date?

00:23:40.840 --> 00:23:42.280
Who else is in your family?

00:23:42.280 --> 00:23:44.240
What does your family do?

00:23:44.240 --> 00:23:46.200
Do you have any famous ancestors?

00:23:47.160 --> 00:23:48.160
Well...

00:23:50.520 --> 00:23:51.360
Well...

00:23:52.160 --> 00:23:52.480
You...

00:23:52.480 --> 00:23:53.680
Madam!

00:23:54.160 --> 00:23:55.960
Madam!

00:23:57.840 --> 00:23:58.880
Ms. Zheng.

00:23:59.040 --> 00:24:00.960
Why are you fighting with this pillar?

00:24:00.960 --> 00:24:02.200
Come down and talk.

00:24:02.440 --> 00:24:03.280
I'm not going.

00:24:03.520 --> 00:24:03.960
Madam.

00:24:03.960 --> 00:24:05.200
Forget about the family tree.

00:24:05.200 --> 00:24:06.280
But now...

00:24:06.280 --> 00:24:08.280
I'm not going to the ancestral tomb

00:24:08.880 --> 00:24:10.440
I'm not asking you to go to the grave.

00:24:10.440 --> 00:24:12.280
It's for you to choose the tomb

00:24:12.360 --> 00:24:14.200
buried together 100 years later.

00:24:14.200 --> 00:24:15.720
Are you poisonous?

00:24:16.160 --> 00:24:17.680
I'm not going.

00:24:18.760 --> 00:24:19.520
Ms. Zheng.

00:24:19.880 --> 00:24:21.040
The tomb of the house

00:24:21.360 --> 00:24:22.440
It was a place

00:24:22.440 --> 00:24:24.400
from the royal family 200 years ago.

00:24:24.400 --> 00:24:25.680
is on the side of the Dragon Vein.

00:24:25.680 --> 00:24:27.120
It's a rare opportunity.

00:24:27.640 --> 00:24:28.960
Bury yourself if you want.

00:24:28.960 --> 00:24:30.360
I'm young and beautiful.

00:24:30.400 --> 00:24:31.840
Why should I choose a cemetery?

00:24:31.840 --> 00:24:33.170
It's not your cemetery.

00:24:33.440 --> 00:24:34.520
It's our cemetery.

00:24:34.960 --> 00:24:37.120
Xiao Zheng, you were born as a family.

00:24:37.200 --> 00:24:38.730
and died as a haunted house.

00:24:38.960 --> 00:24:39.880
Do you feel

00:24:40.360 --> 00:24:41.280
my feelings?

00:24:41.880 --> 00:24:44.840
You died before I agreed.

00:24:45.520 --> 00:24:46.400
That's scary.

00:24:46.600 --> 00:24:46.960
Okay.

00:24:47.960 --> 00:24:49.760
I'll change a way you can accept.

00:24:51.360 --> 00:24:54.400
Be normal. I don't ask for anything.

00:24:54.840 --> 00:24:56.200
Please be normal.

00:25:01.680 --> 00:25:03.440
Separation hatred asked you how.

00:25:03.440 --> 00:25:04.480
You answered him.

00:25:04.920 --> 00:25:05.920
Doesn't that mean

00:25:06.000 --> 00:25:08.120
there's still room for you to develop.

00:25:08.120 --> 00:25:09.450
Then why am I still here?

00:25:10.200 --> 00:25:12.000
Why don't I make room for you two?

00:25:17.920 --> 00:25:18.680
Sorry.

00:25:19.200 --> 00:25:20.530
I never loved any woman.

00:25:20.960 --> 00:25:22.160
You're the first one.

00:25:22.720 --> 00:25:23.240
Xiao Zheng.

00:25:23.240 --> 00:25:24.040
I was rude.

00:25:24.040 --> 00:25:25.000
Come down.

00:25:29.120 --> 00:25:30.050
Don't come over.

00:25:30.440 --> 00:25:32.440
If you follow me, I'll bite you.

00:25:36.440 --> 00:25:38.160
At the speed of the bang,

00:25:39.440 --> 00:25:41.520
when she walked to the second pillar,

00:25:41.520 --> 00:25:43.680
I can meet her when I go out.

00:25:48.440 --> 00:25:49.970
Why are you running so fast?

00:25:56.840 --> 00:25:59.000
Xu Ziqi, where are you going?

00:26:01.400 --> 00:26:02.280
Xu Ziqi!

00:26:03.960 --> 00:26:05.090
Where are you going?

00:26:06.000 --> 00:26:07.480
You haven't recovered yet.

00:26:07.480 --> 00:26:09.680
I'm leaving, Mrs. Fang.

00:26:10.000 --> 00:26:11.260
Why should I stay here?

00:26:11.440 --> 00:26:12.640
Am I in a high position?

00:26:12.640 --> 00:26:13.640
My family is rich?

00:26:15.400 --> 00:26:16.120
Indeed.

00:26:17.200 --> 00:26:18.530
Brother Xu is innocent.

00:26:18.720 --> 00:26:19.850
He's a man of honour.

00:26:20.160 --> 00:26:21.960
is not as wealthy as my family.

00:26:22.200 --> 00:26:23.600
It's worth a lot of money.

00:26:26.440 --> 00:26:28.200
Xu, are you leaving?

00:26:28.360 --> 00:26:29.480
I'll see myself out.

00:26:29.480 --> 00:26:31.680
Yang Lin, prepare a sedan chair for him.

00:26:31.880 --> 00:26:32.720
Brother Xu hasn't fully recovered.

00:26:32.720 --> 00:26:33.120
Yes.

00:26:33.200 --> 00:26:34.730
Don't let him work too hard.

00:26:34.760 --> 00:26:35.760
Separate hatred.

00:26:36.120 --> 00:26:37.980
You said he hasn't recovered yet.

00:26:38.040 --> 00:26:39.680
How could you let him go?

00:26:41.200 --> 00:26:41.960
Madam.

00:26:42.640 --> 00:26:43.880
Brother Xu is leaving.

00:26:43.880 --> 00:26:45.160
He must be busy.

00:26:45.440 --> 00:26:46.760
How can we stop him?

00:26:50.120 --> 00:26:52.520
I said I'm not your wife.

00:26:52.720 --> 00:26:55.120
If you call me madam again, I'll beat you up.

00:26:56.200 --> 00:26:56.960
Shy

00:26:57.640 --> 00:26:58.360
I'm shy.

00:26:58.360 --> 00:26:58.880
I...

00:26:59.480 --> 00:27:00.010
Yang Lin.

00:27:00.120 --> 00:27:00.440
I...

00:27:00.440 --> 00:27:01.200
Prepare the sedan.

00:27:01.200 --> 00:27:01.720
Okay.

00:27:01.840 --> 00:27:04.120
No need. I'll go by myself.

00:27:06.640 --> 00:27:07.840
Goodbye, Brother Xu.

00:27:08.520 --> 00:27:10.850
Goodbye, Lord Xu. Come again another day.

00:27:22.880 --> 00:27:23.760
Xu Ziqi.

00:27:30.720 --> 00:27:31.880
Xu Ziqi.

00:27:40.960 --> 00:27:42.560
Isn't this the way to escape?

00:27:42.720 --> 00:27:44.200
When I was holding you

00:27:44.280 --> 00:27:45.340
Why can't I make it?

00:27:45.400 --> 00:27:45.960
I...

00:27:46.240 --> 00:27:47.000
You have no idea

00:27:47.000 --> 00:27:48.200
how hard I used

00:27:48.240 --> 00:27:49.480
to hold that pillar.

00:27:49.840 --> 00:27:51.500
Four or five servants held me.

00:27:52.240 --> 00:27:53.840
I wouldn't have recovered so soon.

00:27:53.840 --> 00:27:55.170
Break away from hatred.

00:27:56.040 --> 00:27:56.880
So,

00:27:58.040 --> 00:27:59.440
you want to break free,

00:28:00.200 --> 00:28:02.280
but you can't.

00:28:06.600 --> 00:28:08.000
Why are you following me?

00:28:09.400 --> 00:28:10.200
Well...

00:28:11.480 --> 00:28:12.280
I...

00:28:13.000 --> 00:28:14.280
just want to ask you

00:28:17.760 --> 00:28:19.560
Will you work hard to make money?

00:28:23.920 --> 00:28:25.480
You don't have to make that fast.

00:28:25.480 --> 00:28:26.880
Let's talk.

00:28:27.960 --> 00:28:30.240
Is this the first day you know me?

00:28:30.800 --> 00:28:31.800
If my goal

00:28:31.800 --> 00:28:33.080
is to be rich,

00:28:33.240 --> 00:28:34.480
I'm full.

00:28:34.480 --> 00:28:35.720
I've donated so many properties

00:28:35.720 --> 00:28:36.780
from my ancestors.

00:28:36.840 --> 00:28:37.720
I'm full.

00:28:37.720 --> 00:28:39.640
I don't want to inherit the title of the family.

00:28:39.640 --> 00:28:40.400
I just want to

00:28:40.400 --> 00:28:41.960
be a delinquent

00:28:42.400 --> 00:28:44.200
and live my life in peace.

00:28:44.680 --> 00:28:47.140
You said you liked me and wanted to pursue me.

00:28:47.680 --> 00:28:50.440
But liking and chasing are verbs.

00:28:51.000 --> 00:28:53.480
You have to act, not just saying.

00:28:55.240 --> 00:28:56.640
So you're giving up

00:28:56.840 --> 00:28:58.680
because I pursued you?

00:28:59.200 --> 00:29:00.120
In that case,

00:29:00.120 --> 00:29:01.200
the goal of life

00:29:01.640 --> 00:29:02.840
I choose my life goal.

00:29:03.960 --> 00:29:04.360
You...

00:29:09.520 --> 00:29:10.360
Miss Zheng.

00:29:10.640 --> 00:29:11.520
Listen to me.

00:29:12.400 --> 00:29:13.600
This heart

00:29:13.680 --> 00:29:15.040
can only be given to one person.

00:29:15.040 --> 00:29:17.840
Although Lord Xu loves you,

00:29:18.400 --> 00:29:19.440
but he's gone.

00:29:20.440 --> 00:29:21.640
Look at Lord Fang.

00:29:21.880 --> 00:29:24.120
is devoted to you.

00:29:25.640 --> 00:29:27.900
If you want your marriage to go smoothly,

00:29:27.920 --> 00:29:28.640
Well...

00:29:28.960 --> 00:29:30.020
be single-minded.

00:29:30.760 --> 00:29:31.600
Yes, Zheng.

00:29:31.960 --> 00:29:33.240
Brother Xu is leaving.

00:29:33.400 --> 00:29:34.880
Why don't we go back to the mansion

00:29:34.880 --> 00:29:35.680
and discuss how to be

00:29:35.680 --> 00:29:37.880
the normal couple you mentioned, okay?

00:29:40.040 --> 00:29:41.840
I'm not going.

00:29:43.280 --> 00:29:43.940
Xiao Zheng.

00:29:44.720 --> 00:29:45.640
Miss Xiao Zheng.

00:29:45.640 --> 00:29:47.880
From now on, not only the house,

00:29:48.200 --> 00:29:49.920
but also your home.

00:29:50.120 --> 00:29:50.640
Yes.

00:29:50.960 --> 00:29:52.120
It's our home.

00:29:53.280 --> 00:29:55.040
Yes, your home.

00:29:56.000 --> 00:29:56.680
I'll leave.

00:29:57.440 --> 00:29:58.040
Goodbye, Brother Xu.

00:29:58.040 --> 00:29:58.920
Don't go.

00:30:02.720 --> 00:30:05.720
I dragged him back because I have something to tell him.

00:30:05.720 --> 00:30:06.320
What is it?

00:30:09.040 --> 00:30:10.120
How to get rich?

00:30:10.160 --> 00:30:11.420
I don't want to be rich.

00:30:11.440 --> 00:30:12.440
No, you do.

00:30:12.440 --> 00:30:12.840
I...

00:30:12.880 --> 00:30:14.210
You must think about it.

00:30:19.360 --> 00:30:20.420
Enough, Lord Fang.

00:30:20.760 --> 00:30:21.520
Miss Xiao.

00:30:21.520 --> 00:30:22.280
Let's go.

00:30:23.840 --> 00:30:24.440
Let's go.

00:30:24.960 --> 00:30:25.760
Let's go.

00:30:32.640 --> 00:30:33.240
My lord.

00:30:33.600 --> 00:30:35.520
The tea and dessert are ready.

00:30:35.920 --> 00:30:36.840
Please go in.

00:30:37.200 --> 00:30:38.600
Now that I think about it,

00:30:39.240 --> 00:30:41.200
I've done

00:30:41.440 --> 00:30:42.640
you taught me before.

00:30:44.120 --> 00:30:45.980
Being rich is just a piece of work.

00:30:47.640 --> 00:30:50.200
Since you said you wanted to show your true heart,

00:30:50.200 --> 00:30:50.960
I think

00:30:51.520 --> 00:30:52.480
love

00:30:53.200 --> 00:30:54.200
is really bitter.

00:30:54.920 --> 00:30:56.000
But even so,

00:30:56.280 --> 00:30:58.280
I tried my best.

00:31:00.000 --> 00:31:01.240
Why didn't she agree

00:31:01.240 --> 00:31:02.240
to be with me?

00:31:03.120 --> 00:31:05.520
Was your love for me a lie?

00:31:08.000 --> 00:31:10.760
It's too sad to say that.

00:31:12.680 --> 00:31:13.440
In the past,

00:31:13.880 --> 00:31:15.440
I was just worried about my mother. I was worried about her.

00:31:15.440 --> 00:31:16.920
and the House of Light.

00:31:18.960 --> 00:31:20.220
Although life is hard,

00:31:21.000 --> 00:31:22.060
I still have a goal.

00:31:22.760 --> 00:31:24.220
Now that I met Hua Xiaochi,

00:31:25.400 --> 00:31:26.960
everything has changed.

00:31:28.440 --> 00:31:29.360
Suddenly I feel

00:31:30.000 --> 00:31:31.600
life is so complicated.

00:31:34.000 --> 00:31:34.760
My lord.

00:31:34.960 --> 00:31:35.760
You used to

00:31:36.680 --> 00:31:38.400
dealt with officials.

00:31:38.920 --> 00:31:39.960
Money for money.

00:31:40.360 --> 00:31:41.680
It's all for money.

00:31:42.160 --> 00:31:44.290
This is the easiest thing in the world.

00:31:44.760 --> 00:31:45.720
And love

00:31:46.240 --> 00:31:47.640
doesn't distinguish right from wrong.

00:31:47.640 --> 00:31:49.900
Sincerity doesn't matter how long it is.

00:31:49.960 --> 00:31:51.280
the first problem.

00:31:53.880 --> 00:31:54.940
All right, my lord.

00:31:55.120 --> 00:31:56.040
Let's not talk about this.

00:31:56.040 --> 00:31:56.880
Let's go in.

00:31:57.720 --> 00:32:00.280
Mr. Xu and Ms. Li are waiting for you.

00:32:00.680 --> 00:32:01.440
Please.

00:32:28.360 --> 00:32:28.960
This...

00:32:29.400 --> 00:32:30.960
is Tang's water transport map.

00:32:30.960 --> 00:32:32.360
If you want to make money,

00:32:32.960 --> 00:32:34.840
business is the fastest way.

00:32:37.200 --> 00:32:38.730
Since the founding of Tang,

00:32:38.920 --> 00:32:41.650
the transport of Sui Dynasty has been developed.

00:32:42.200 --> 00:32:45.260
Now we can communicate between the South and the North.

00:32:45.360 --> 00:32:47.480
daily necessities,

00:32:47.760 --> 00:32:48.920
Medicine, jewelry,

00:32:49.200 --> 00:32:51.260
These five are the most influential.

00:32:51.400 --> 00:32:54.120
The difference between the South and the North can be dozens of times.

00:32:54.120 --> 00:32:56.720
If you work with the Carp Alliance,

00:32:57.840 --> 00:32:58.970
within three years,

00:32:59.960 --> 00:33:01.360
in less than three years.

00:33:10.160 --> 00:33:11.480
This is amazing.

00:33:11.720 --> 00:33:13.480
Xu Ziqi is reliable.

00:33:13.600 --> 00:33:14.660
I'll work with you.

00:33:16.480 --> 00:33:17.880
But there's a condition.

00:33:19.440 --> 00:33:20.440
What is it?

00:33:20.480 --> 00:33:22.210
It's a merchant registration.

00:33:22.880 --> 00:33:24.280
Business registration?

00:33:24.400 --> 00:33:27.860
Only when you enter the merchant register can you do business.

00:33:34.160 --> 00:33:35.820
Actually, I don't understand

00:33:36.360 --> 00:33:38.720
why the merchant register is considered a lowly person.

00:33:38.720 --> 00:33:41.050
You make money with your skills and brain.

00:33:41.960 --> 00:33:43.820
What's there to be looked down on?

00:33:44.640 --> 00:33:46.720
Businessmen don't rely on hard work.

00:33:47.880 --> 00:33:50.040
Second, they have no knowledge of sages.

00:33:50.040 --> 00:33:50.960
It depends on

00:33:51.520 --> 00:33:53.960
by some means.

00:33:54.640 --> 00:33:56.240
and earn money

00:33:56.440 --> 00:33:58.200
the hard-earned money.

00:34:02.600 --> 00:34:03.720
Businessmen

00:34:04.360 --> 00:34:05.620
is not fair and square.

00:34:06.520 --> 00:34:07.840
Only a rich family

00:34:08.440 --> 00:34:09.770
and no noble character.

00:34:10.760 --> 00:34:11.560
So...

00:34:12.080 --> 00:34:13.320
You think so too?

00:34:17.280 --> 00:34:17.920
Yes.

00:34:19.440 --> 00:34:20.440
Separate hatred.

00:34:20.639 --> 00:34:23.159
Maybe the way a businessman used to do business is wrong.

00:34:23.159 --> 00:34:24.719
to leave a bad impression.

00:34:24.840 --> 00:34:26.639
If someone enters the business register,

00:34:26.639 --> 00:34:28.520
and changes the bad business behavior,

00:34:28.520 --> 00:34:31.580
Maybe people will change their opinions on merchants.

00:34:32.880 --> 00:34:33.639
No.

00:34:34.120 --> 00:34:36.239
All these years in the Chamber of Commerce,

00:34:36.239 --> 00:34:37.699
I only realized one thing.

00:34:37.960 --> 00:34:39.290
No businessman is evil.

00:34:43.719 --> 00:34:44.980
I have something to do.

00:34:45.080 --> 00:34:46.080
You can leave now.

00:34:47.120 --> 00:34:47.960
Well...

00:34:51.400 --> 00:34:52.920
Kuang, let's go.

00:34:53.520 --> 00:34:54.040
But...

00:35:00.880 --> 00:35:02.140
I want to be a merchant.

00:35:02.760 --> 00:35:03.520
Ms. Zheng.

00:35:03.840 --> 00:35:05.520
Don't say that.

00:35:05.760 --> 00:35:06.400
Kuang.

00:35:06.960 --> 00:35:08.720
Think carefully before you speak.

00:35:08.720 --> 00:35:09.240
Yes.

00:35:13.960 --> 00:35:15.920
I've thought about it for a long time.

00:35:15.920 --> 00:35:17.180
I want to be a merchant.

00:35:17.800 --> 00:35:20.120
Since I saw some ways of the Chamber of Commerce,

00:35:20.120 --> 00:35:21.780
I've been very dissatisfied.

00:35:21.920 --> 00:35:23.320
I wanted to fight them.

00:35:23.760 --> 00:35:25.360
and thought about what to do.

00:35:26.360 --> 00:35:28.760
I just didn't expect to enter a merchant register.

00:35:28.760 --> 00:35:30.640
It may be a lowly identity

00:35:30.640 --> 00:35:31.920
to many people.

00:35:32.440 --> 00:35:34.800
But I believe if I really

00:35:35.600 --> 00:35:37.360
in the right way,

00:35:37.480 --> 00:35:38.840
you can change it.

00:35:41.800 --> 00:35:42.560
This

00:35:43.120 --> 00:35:44.440
once in my life.

00:35:45.800 --> 00:35:47.860
You can't enter a merchant register.

00:35:48.160 --> 00:35:48.960
Why?

00:35:50.360 --> 00:35:52.090
Because you're my future wife.

00:35:52.520 --> 00:35:53.760
I don't want to see you

00:35:54.320 --> 00:35:55.320
to be looked down

00:35:55.960 --> 00:35:57.360
despised by others.

00:35:59.600 --> 00:36:00.730
Separating hatred.

00:36:00.960 --> 00:36:03.080
You are the chairman of the Chamber of Commerce.

00:36:03.080 --> 00:36:05.080
We can work hard for this.

00:36:05.520 --> 00:36:06.520
You have to believe

00:36:06.520 --> 00:36:07.920
if you do the right thing,

00:36:07.920 --> 00:36:09.360
you'll get a good result.

00:36:10.760 --> 00:36:13.040
I did a lot of bad things before.

00:36:13.800 --> 00:36:14.240
I also realized

00:36:14.240 --> 00:36:16.560
in the process of being the Oiran.

00:36:18.000 --> 00:36:19.520
I want to be

00:36:19.520 --> 00:36:20.960
who can help others.

00:36:21.520 --> 00:36:22.560
We can develop

00:36:22.560 --> 00:36:23.840
what the people need.

00:36:24.440 --> 00:36:26.080
at a cheap price.

00:36:26.720 --> 00:36:28.760
Isn't this something a good businessman

00:36:28.760 --> 00:36:29.920
can do?

00:36:47.600 --> 00:36:49.600
Are you asking me if I look down on merchants?

00:36:49.600 --> 00:36:50.760
I'm telling you now.

00:36:51.160 --> 00:36:52.690
I'm not looking down on you.

00:36:52.960 --> 00:36:53.920
I hate you.

00:36:57.000 --> 00:36:57.840
Come with me.

00:37:25.040 --> 00:37:25.800
Miss Xiao.

00:37:26.280 --> 00:37:28.280
Take a good look at this family tree.

00:37:28.440 --> 00:37:30.370
Master was a second-rank official

00:37:30.560 --> 00:37:31.840
a second-rank official.

00:37:31.840 --> 00:37:33.040
to assist the Emperor

00:37:33.160 --> 00:37:34.440
and improve the people.

00:37:34.440 --> 00:37:36.120
and be respected by the people.

00:37:36.120 --> 00:37:39.480
You were once the best student in the Imperial Education Bureau.

00:37:39.480 --> 00:37:41.160
He devoted himself to the imperial exam.

00:37:41.160 --> 00:37:42.440
With your talent,

00:37:43.040 --> 00:37:45.000
you should have made a name in the imperial examination.

00:37:45.000 --> 00:37:46.120
and become an official.

00:37:46.120 --> 00:37:47.360
and serve the court.

00:37:47.920 --> 00:37:48.720
But

00:37:49.080 --> 00:37:51.120
once his family was destroyed,

00:37:51.760 --> 00:37:54.360
my parents were exiled to the border.

00:37:54.440 --> 00:37:56.960
I was left in Chang'an as a hostage.

00:37:57.480 --> 00:37:59.480
as a hostage.

00:38:00.120 --> 00:38:01.650
To suppress me completely,

00:38:02.240 --> 00:38:03.840
I was banished into a merchant register.

00:38:03.840 --> 00:38:05.640
I studied hard since I was young.

00:38:05.800 --> 00:38:07.260
But because I was demoted,

00:38:07.440 --> 00:38:10.240
I was disqualified to take the civil examination.

00:38:11.040 --> 00:38:13.720
and was expelled from the Imperial Education Bureau.

00:38:13.720 --> 00:38:15.180
and can never enter again.

00:38:15.600 --> 00:38:17.480
I want to realize my ambition

00:38:17.800 --> 00:38:19.130
to realize my ambition.

00:38:21.320 --> 00:38:24.280
You're demoted to a merchant and can't ride horses for a lifetime.

00:38:24.280 --> 00:38:27.320
I used to be a young man

00:38:27.480 --> 00:38:28.960
in Chang'an.

00:38:30.040 --> 00:38:30.880
Now,

00:38:33.960 --> 00:38:35.360
Do you think I like

00:38:35.480 --> 00:38:37.120
in a luxurious sedan?

00:38:37.600 --> 00:38:38.930
That's a cage to trap me.

00:38:39.880 --> 00:38:40.760
But I have to

00:38:41.840 --> 00:38:44.360
pretend that everything is normal.

00:38:46.440 --> 00:38:48.300
Because if I don't take the sedan,

00:38:48.400 --> 00:38:49.480
I have to walk.

00:38:51.960 --> 00:38:52.840
I lost

00:38:52.840 --> 00:38:54.720
my last bit of dignity.

00:38:55.280 --> 00:38:56.480
can only

00:38:56.960 --> 00:38:57.960
in the crowd.

00:38:58.800 --> 00:38:59.960
It's a great honor.

00:39:00.760 --> 00:39:02.360
The biggest stain in my life

00:39:02.880 --> 00:39:04.320
in my life.

00:39:05.320 --> 00:39:06.960
I tried my best

00:39:07.000 --> 00:39:08.530
to get rid of this identity.

00:39:08.760 --> 00:39:10.600
And you, Hua Xiaochi,

00:39:11.480 --> 00:39:12.600
my future wife

00:39:12.960 --> 00:39:14.360
is going to be a merchant.

00:39:15.600 --> 00:39:16.440
Li.

00:39:21.760 --> 00:39:22.560
Everyone says

00:39:23.840 --> 00:39:25.960
I want to get rid of my son of a sinner.

00:39:27.880 --> 00:39:28.480
No.

00:39:29.320 --> 00:39:31.380
I never thought my father was guilty.

00:39:33.320 --> 00:39:34.400
I love my father.

00:39:35.440 --> 00:39:36.640
To my father.

00:39:37.480 --> 00:39:39.140
What I really want to get rid of

00:39:39.280 --> 00:39:40.940
is the identity of a merchant.

00:39:40.960 --> 00:39:43.800
I was looked down upon by the merchant.

00:39:44.760 --> 00:39:46.220
and I've been in darkness.

00:39:47.760 --> 00:39:49.080
and fell into hell.

00:39:54.760 --> 00:39:55.520
Zheng.

00:39:56.960 --> 00:39:57.840
Do you remember

00:39:58.360 --> 00:40:00.360
the day the Oiran went on the street?

00:40:00.440 --> 00:40:01.440
You told me

00:40:02.000 --> 00:40:03.200
you would protect me.

00:40:04.160 --> 00:40:05.960
If you really want to protect me,

00:40:06.920 --> 00:40:08.720
if you really want to protect me.

00:40:09.600 --> 00:40:12.080
Because I don't want to see the person I love the most.

00:40:12.080 --> 00:40:13.240
My future wife

00:40:13.920 --> 00:40:15.440
has the identity

00:40:15.880 --> 00:40:17.160
I hate the most.

00:40:19.440 --> 00:40:20.440
Separate hatred.

00:40:21.360 --> 00:40:22.080
I'm sorry.

00:40:22.880 --> 00:40:24.540
I didn't know I was a merchant.

00:40:24.720 --> 00:40:25.960
hurt you so much.

00:40:26.440 --> 00:40:28.320
I can understand

00:40:28.960 --> 00:40:30.360
I totally understand.

00:40:31.880 --> 00:40:33.540
Because it's too hard for you.

00:40:34.040 --> 00:40:36.640
I don't want you to carry on with your identity.

00:40:39.360 --> 00:40:40.080
But...

00:40:42.360 --> 00:40:43.420
Separating hatred

00:40:44.280 --> 00:40:46.160
It's your way to get rid of the trade registration.

00:40:46.160 --> 00:40:47.820
Entering merchants is my way.

00:40:48.360 --> 00:40:49.520
This is the only way in Chang'an.

00:40:49.520 --> 00:40:51.080
in Chang'an.

00:40:52.240 --> 00:40:53.480
It may not be as big

00:40:53.480 --> 00:40:54.520
as big as you.

00:40:54.960 --> 00:40:56.890
But there's something I want to do.

00:40:59.080 --> 00:41:00.680
I hope you can understand me.

00:41:06.080 --> 00:41:06.920
Zheng.

00:41:08.040 --> 00:41:09.170
Do you care about me?

00:41:13.880 --> 00:41:15.440
Why do you want to be a merchant?

00:41:15.440 --> 00:41:16.960
Have you ever thought about our future?

00:41:16.960 --> 00:41:19.160
Have you ever thought about our future?

00:41:22.600 --> 00:41:25.440
The second thing I want to tell you

00:41:26.840 --> 00:41:27.960
I'm Hua Xiaochi.

00:41:28.760 --> 00:41:30.490
I'm not someone's attachment.

00:41:31.480 --> 00:41:33.240
Everyone in Chang'an knows that

00:41:33.240 --> 00:41:34.560
I've proposed to you.

00:41:36.080 --> 00:41:38.410
Are you going to break off the engagement?

00:41:38.440 --> 00:41:39.000
But...

00:41:39.760 --> 00:41:41.960
But after thinking about it these days,

00:41:43.240 --> 00:41:45.080
I can't make up my mind to marry you.

00:41:45.080 --> 00:41:45.760
Why?

00:41:50.920 --> 00:41:52.650
It's because of Xu Ziqi, right?

00:41:55.000 --> 00:41:56.530
It's not because of Xu Ziqi.

00:41:57.360 --> 00:41:59.620
It's because we have different choices.

00:42:01.760 --> 00:42:02.520
Okay.

00:42:03.720 --> 00:42:05.520
Let's take our time.

00:42:06.040 --> 00:42:08.640
Join the trade register won't solve anything.

00:42:08.720 --> 00:42:10.580
Let's think of another way, okay?

00:42:11.960 --> 00:42:12.760
Ms. Zheng.

00:42:12.960 --> 00:42:13.760
Stop it.

00:42:14.360 --> 00:42:16.240
I'll tell

00:42:16.640 --> 00:42:17.760
about the rest.

00:42:18.160 --> 00:42:20.280
The sedan chair of the Chamber of Commerce is ready.

00:42:20.280 --> 00:42:22.210
The Grand Elder is waiting for you.

00:42:22.280 --> 00:42:23.080
Don’t delay.

00:42:23.640 --> 00:42:25.440
Leave it to me.

00:42:26.520 --> 00:42:27.360
Forget it.

00:42:28.320 --> 00:42:30.250
I've said everything I need to say.

00:42:51.000 --> 00:42:51.840
Ms. Zheng.

00:42:52.600 --> 00:42:53.760
What you just said

00:42:54.120 --> 00:42:55.760
is too shocking to adults

00:42:55.960 --> 00:42:57.420
Adults need some time now.

00:42:58.960 --> 00:43:01.720
He can't accept you as a merchant.

00:43:01.960 --> 00:43:02.840
But now,

00:43:03.440 --> 00:43:04.970
you rejected his proposal.

00:43:05.320 --> 00:43:06.720
What do you want him to do?

00:43:08.240 --> 00:43:10.040
If I don't tell him now,

00:43:10.080 --> 00:43:11.340
Should we drag this on?

00:43:11.960 --> 00:43:13.240
I'm harming him.

00:43:13.320 --> 00:43:14.380
Do you understand?

00:43:15.880 --> 00:43:16.480
Lord Xu.

00:43:17.080 --> 00:43:17.960
please

00:43:18.080 --> 00:43:20.440
please persuade my lord.

00:43:20.600 --> 00:43:22.720
I need to go to the Chamber of Commerce with him.

00:43:22.720 --> 00:43:23.720
Please, Mr. Xu.

00:43:34.280 --> 00:43:36.410
You need to ask him what the divorce is.

00:43:37.400 --> 00:43:39.200
He has to understand two things.

00:43:39.280 --> 00:43:40.040
First,

00:43:40.040 --> 00:43:43.400
I don't care if I become his wife or not.

00:43:43.720 --> 00:43:45.120
Second,

00:43:46.760 --> 00:43:48.560
I didn't say I want to be his wife.

00:43:52.600 --> 00:43:53.440
Then...

00:43:54.320 --> 00:43:55.480
What a pity.

00:43:56.480 --> 00:43:58.280
He is in a high position.

00:43:58.480 --> 00:43:59.880
He's rich.

00:44:00.600 --> 00:44:01.600
Say that again.

00:44:04.040 --> 00:44:05.880
I was wrong.

00:44:07.800 --> 00:44:10.060
I must enter the business registration.

00:44:10.960 --> 00:44:12.160
This is my job.

00:44:13.000 --> 00:44:13.880
Then do it.

00:44:14.320 --> 00:44:15.720
Forget about other things.

00:44:15.720 --> 00:44:17.400
I still support you on this.

00:44:19.000 --> 00:44:21.000
Okay, let's do it together.

00:44:21.240 --> 00:44:22.570
Let's be rich together.

00:44:30.440 --> 00:44:31.280
Xiao Zheng.

00:44:31.880 --> 00:44:33.880
Being an official makes a fortune

00:44:34.360 --> 00:44:35.880
is not my pursuit of life.

00:44:37.000 --> 00:44:38.760
I don't want to change myself.

00:44:39.320 --> 00:44:41.320
Just like I don't want to change you.

00:44:42.280 --> 00:44:45.400
You want Fang Li to take down the Chamber of Commerce with you.

00:44:45.400 --> 00:44:46.160
As you know,

00:44:46.400 --> 00:44:48.730
the Chamber of Commerce does evil things.

00:44:49.800 --> 00:44:50.920
If he falls into it,

00:44:51.120 --> 00:44:52.720
he'll only get deeper and deeper.

00:44:52.720 --> 00:44:54.980
Will you force him to join hands with you?

00:44:55.960 --> 00:44:56.760
No.

00:44:59.160 --> 00:44:59.960
Why?

00:45:00.520 --> 00:45:02.180
Because I'm not a separation.

00:45:02.560 --> 00:45:04.490
I've never walked the path he took.

00:45:04.960 --> 00:45:06.160
Why didn't you force him?

00:45:06.160 --> 00:45:07.290
Why did you force me?

00:45:08.560 --> 00:45:09.120
You...

00:45:09.440 --> 00:45:11.600
You're so insincere in pursuing me.

00:45:12.360 --> 00:45:12.880
I...

00:45:14.360 --> 00:45:16.160
I can't explain it to you, right?

00:45:17.360 --> 00:45:19.240
I can't pursue you

00:45:19.240 --> 00:45:20.300
I can't pursue you.

00:45:20.440 --> 00:45:22.560
Yes, you must be an official.

00:45:22.640 --> 00:45:23.600
You must be rich.

00:45:23.600 --> 00:45:25.460
Be an official and make a fortune.

00:45:25.880 --> 00:45:26.440
You...

00:45:27.280 --> 00:45:28.160
Don't push me.

00:45:28.440 --> 00:45:30.900
You can jump over the wall if you're anxious.

00:45:31.040 --> 00:45:32.040
What do you mean?

00:45:37.960 --> 00:45:39.620
I learned something from you.

00:45:40.120 --> 00:45:41.850
I thought it was unreasonable.

00:45:41.960 --> 00:45:43.160
At this moment and here,

00:45:43.160 --> 00:45:44.620
I think we can give it a try.

00:45:45.080 --> 00:45:45.960
What?

00:45:52.920 --> 00:45:53.680
I'm so mad.
