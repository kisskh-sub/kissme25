00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:05.360
Xu Ziqi.

00:02:11.320 --> 00:02:12.450
Where are you going?

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:15.810
What are you doing here?

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:18.680
Studying how women in Chang'an

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:21.200
match clothes and accessories?

00:02:23.079 --> 00:02:23.680
Good luck.

00:02:23.960 --> 00:02:24.520
Xu Ziqi.

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:29.200
Let me ask you.

00:02:30.079 --> 00:02:31.480
Compared to Gu Jin'er,

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:34.840
other than my body,

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:36.520
other questions?

00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:41.320
No, nothing.

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:46.800
Look carefully.

00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:49.040
I'm asking you seriously.

00:02:49.320 --> 00:02:52.050
I have to find a difference in choosing the Oiran.

00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:02.520
That's good.

00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:05.960
Pretty. Pretty cute.

00:03:06.960 --> 00:03:07.800
Pretty good.

00:03:08.520 --> 00:03:09.650
Everything's fine.

00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:12.520
I need to patrol the streets.

00:03:12.520 --> 00:03:13.380
I have to go now.

00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:16.040
Good luck.

00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:22.570
Come on. Come on.

00:03:32.920 --> 00:03:33.680
Stop!

00:03:37.240 --> 00:03:38.360
Who's in the sedan?

00:03:38.360 --> 00:03:39.560
Ask Hua Xiaochi to come here

00:03:39.560 --> 00:03:41.240
Shut up if you shouldn't ask.

00:03:50.040 --> 00:03:51.170
Is it Hua Xiao Zheng?

00:03:51.200 --> 00:03:52.680
Master Yi wants to see you.

00:03:53.680 --> 00:03:54.760
Master Yi.

00:03:58.840 --> 00:03:59.440
Watch out!

00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:09.240
Xiao Zheng.

00:04:10.080 --> 00:04:13.880
This is the Chief Elder of the Four Elders of the Chamber of Commerce.

00:04:14.840 --> 00:04:16.240
Greetings, Elder Yi.

00:04:17.320 --> 00:04:18.320
I heard

00:04:18.640 --> 00:04:20.320
you are a farmhouse slave.

00:04:21.519 --> 00:04:22.520
What slave?

00:04:22.880 --> 00:04:24.680
You're indeed ignorant

00:04:24.960 --> 00:04:26.120
and rude.

00:04:26.800 --> 00:04:28.080
A woman like you

00:04:28.520 --> 00:04:30.880
is even with Gu Jin'er.

00:04:31.320 --> 00:04:33.000
You are really lucky.

00:04:33.960 --> 00:04:35.080
But the final

00:04:35.640 --> 00:04:37.320
doesn't depend on luck.

00:04:38.640 --> 00:04:39.120
Oh.

00:04:39.440 --> 00:04:40.370
It's... It's...

00:04:40.800 --> 00:04:41.880
What does it mean?

00:04:42.320 --> 00:04:44.680
That's right.

00:04:46.080 --> 00:04:46.880
Stop! Stop!

00:04:47.640 --> 00:04:48.800
You're the one who's here! You're here! You're here!

00:04:48.800 --> 00:04:49.760
If such a woman

00:04:49.960 --> 00:04:52.080
If she becomes the Oiran of Chang'an,

00:04:52.320 --> 00:04:54.960
Tang will be doomed.

00:04:55.800 --> 00:04:57.360
Such behavior...

00:04:57.520 --> 00:04:58.960
Her dress

00:04:59.320 --> 00:05:01.560
I'll punish her to kneel here for two hours.

00:05:01.560 --> 00:05:02.890
and reflect on herself.

00:05:03.320 --> 00:05:05.080
Elder Yi, I'm afraid...

00:05:05.080 --> 00:05:06.480
Is there anything wrong?

00:05:08.880 --> 00:05:09.680
No.

00:05:10.360 --> 00:05:12.000
This woman is a wild woman.

00:05:12.320 --> 00:05:13.680
She should be punished.

00:05:14.080 --> 00:05:14.960
Kneel down.

00:05:24.440 --> 00:05:25.970
You're just a country girl.

00:05:26.120 --> 00:05:28.120
is neither beautiful nor talented.

00:05:28.440 --> 00:05:31.080
and you want to become the Oiran of Chang'an.

00:05:31.320 --> 00:05:33.000
and represent the beauty of Tang.

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:34.560
What a joke.

00:05:35.120 --> 00:05:35.760
Master Yi.

00:05:39.520 --> 00:05:40.680
Greetings, Lord Xu.

00:05:42.960 --> 00:05:44.760
Why are you kneeling here?

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:46.000
Get out of the way!

00:05:46.200 --> 00:05:47.860
They're blocking our patrol.

00:05:47.880 --> 00:05:49.440
We are patrolling today.

00:05:49.760 --> 00:05:51.680
You're in the way kneeling here.

00:05:58.200 --> 00:06:00.680
Lord Xu is really dedicated.

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:03.000
It's just my duty.

00:06:03.200 --> 00:06:04.560
I’m flattered.

00:06:06.760 --> 00:06:07.820
Let's go. Let's go.

00:06:16.760 --> 00:06:17.560
Leave hatred

00:06:18.200 --> 00:06:20.120
Stay away from Hua

00:06:20.960 --> 00:06:23.080
Don't lower your status.

00:06:23.880 --> 00:06:25.440
And Xu Ziqi.

00:06:25.760 --> 00:06:27.120
stay away from him.

00:06:27.680 --> 00:06:29.880
He's not simple.

00:06:31.320 --> 00:06:31.960
Yes.

00:06:40.760 --> 00:06:41.800
I don't need it.

00:06:42.360 --> 00:06:45.320
I won't waste my tears for that kind of person.

00:06:45.640 --> 00:06:47.440
I'll do my best in the competition.

00:06:47.440 --> 00:06:48.680
and piss her off.

00:06:49.440 --> 00:06:50.200
Okay.

00:06:50.560 --> 00:06:51.360
Come on.

00:06:54.200 --> 00:06:55.760
But Husppy is right.

00:06:56.360 --> 00:06:57.680
Gu Jin'er

00:06:58.200 --> 00:07:00.120
in Gu Jin'er.

00:07:00.800 --> 00:07:03.680
That's why she became the Oiran for three years.

00:07:04.880 --> 00:07:06.360
What is this special thing

00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:08.240
this special thing?

00:07:09.960 --> 00:07:12.120
Look at the girls on the street.

00:07:13.320 --> 00:07:15.200
Did you find anything different?

00:07:16.320 --> 00:07:18.200
I've been looking at it all day.

00:07:18.680 --> 00:07:19.940
Nothing is different.

00:07:20.640 --> 00:07:23.520
Do you know why Chang'an

00:07:23.640 --> 00:07:25.240
as the capital of Tang?

00:07:25.440 --> 00:07:27.440
every year?

00:07:28.800 --> 00:07:30.330
I never thought about that.

00:07:31.680 --> 00:07:34.440
The selection of the Oiran

00:07:34.560 --> 00:07:36.880
who can represent Tang.

00:07:37.320 --> 00:07:39.960
She deserves the prosperity of Tang.

00:07:42.200 --> 00:07:44.520
As for why it's Gu Jin'er,

00:07:44.880 --> 00:07:45.760
because

00:07:46.320 --> 00:07:47.760
she has fulfilled

00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:51.240
all the fantasies about the scenery of Tang.

00:07:51.520 --> 00:07:53.000
She is beautiful and elegant.

00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:54.560
She's good at qin, chess, calligraphy and painting.

00:07:54.560 --> 00:07:56.120
and tea ceremony.

00:07:57.320 --> 00:07:58.320
She's perfect.

00:08:00.200 --> 00:08:02.000
So you mean

00:08:02.200 --> 00:08:04.680
the Oiran is to choose a perfect woman

00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:06.560
represents the beauty of Tang.

00:08:06.560 --> 00:08:07.360
That's right.

00:08:09.240 --> 00:08:11.320
But it doesn't make sense.

00:08:11.880 --> 00:08:12.680
Why not?

00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:17.360
Look, not everyone in Tang is perfect.

00:08:17.680 --> 00:08:20.320
Not everyone can recite poems and songs.

00:08:20.560 --> 00:08:21.680
are so beautiful.

00:08:21.760 --> 00:08:23.960
There are thousands of people in Tang.

00:08:24.360 --> 00:08:25.800
Why are you so sure

00:08:25.960 --> 00:08:27.200
Gu Jin'er's beauty?

00:08:27.680 --> 00:08:30.000
is too narrow-minded.

00:08:33.240 --> 00:08:33.960
Besides,

00:08:34.360 --> 00:08:37.799
I don't think the Tang Dynasty is only luxurious.

00:08:38.919 --> 00:08:40.679
What do you think Tang is like?

00:08:40.799 --> 00:08:42.200
It's colorful.

00:08:42.679 --> 00:08:44.610
Each has its own characteristics.

00:08:44.680 --> 00:08:47.320
Everyone has their own unique beauty,

00:08:47.440 --> 00:08:48.680
not everyone

00:08:48.920 --> 00:08:50.680
is Gu Jin'er's replica.

00:08:57.800 --> 00:08:59.680
I know how to win.

00:09:02.440 --> 00:09:03.160
What's wrong?

00:09:03.160 --> 00:09:04.680
Before I came to Chang'an,

00:09:05.160 --> 00:09:08.040
I always thought Chang'an was a bustling place.

00:09:08.320 --> 00:09:09.720
So when it comes to Chang'an,

00:09:09.720 --> 00:09:11.400
people will think of the two sages.

00:09:11.400 --> 00:09:14.440
Madam Gongsun dances swordsmanship and Lord Di Renjie.

00:09:14.440 --> 00:09:15.440
But Xu Ziqi,

00:09:15.800 --> 00:09:17.000
have you ever thought

00:09:17.320 --> 00:09:19.320
the ones who really formed Chang'an

00:09:19.480 --> 00:09:21.010
are not these celebrities.

00:09:24.680 --> 00:09:27.480
but ordinary people.

00:09:27.720 --> 00:09:28.160
Yes.

00:09:28.560 --> 00:09:31.440
They are ordinary people living in Tang.

00:09:32.400 --> 00:09:35.320
So I want to be closer to their lives.

00:09:35.480 --> 00:09:36.540
and speak for them.

00:09:40.440 --> 00:09:41.280
What's wrong?

00:09:41.840 --> 00:09:42.800
There is a place

00:09:43.040 --> 00:09:45.960
for you to observe ordinary people.

00:09:49.440 --> 00:09:50.440
Look at his money.

00:09:50.720 --> 00:09:51.280
Look.

00:09:52.040 --> 00:09:52.960
Look at that.

00:09:55.200 --> 00:09:55.800
Hao.

00:09:55.960 --> 00:09:56.960
Sir! Sir!

00:09:57.560 --> 00:10:00.400
Zheng is going to take part in the final test of the Oiran.

00:10:00.400 --> 00:10:01.960
I'll take her here for observation.

00:10:01.960 --> 00:10:03.220
and find inspiration.

00:10:03.960 --> 00:10:04.320
Yes.

00:10:04.600 --> 00:10:06.080
Observe the life first.

00:10:06.280 --> 00:10:08.960
Then I followed Mr. Xu back to Chang'an.

00:10:09.080 --> 00:10:10.080
Right, Miss Li?

00:10:11.440 --> 00:10:13.320
You swing the swing that morning.

00:10:13.480 --> 00:10:14.840
It was so high.

00:10:14.840 --> 00:10:15.960
Yes.

00:10:16.200 --> 00:10:18.200
When Lord Xu hugged Miss Xiao Zheng,

00:10:18.200 --> 00:10:19.440
It was so stable.

00:10:19.560 --> 00:10:20.200
Yes.

00:10:33.480 --> 00:10:36.560
It's a separation hatred, but there's a cinnabar mole on my chest.

00:10:36.560 --> 00:10:38.800
but I followed Xu Ziqi back to peace.

00:10:39.480 --> 00:10:41.280
The way Xu Ziqi looked at me

00:10:42.160 --> 00:10:43.920
Something is wrong.

00:10:44.960 --> 00:10:48.320
Isn't it too hasty to say yes to him?

00:11:02.160 --> 00:11:03.360
Let's go on the swing.

00:11:16.840 --> 00:11:17.680
Are you okay?

00:11:26.720 --> 00:11:27.560
This...

00:11:28.840 --> 00:11:30.440
When you had dinner,

00:11:31.200 --> 00:11:32.720
when you had dinner.

00:11:33.560 --> 00:11:35.560
Are you not used to living here?

00:11:36.560 --> 00:11:37.200
No.

00:11:37.680 --> 00:11:38.810
This place is great.

00:11:39.320 --> 00:11:40.800
You're an amazing person.

00:11:43.920 --> 00:11:45.560
Let's work hard together.

00:11:50.320 --> 00:11:51.160
Well,

00:11:52.320 --> 00:11:53.680
I'll go back and rest.

00:11:54.200 --> 00:11:56.960
To maintain the peace of Tang,

00:11:57.160 --> 00:12:00.840
and the safety of the people of Tang.

00:12:04.040 --> 00:12:06.720
a delinquent who performs love and reality. Go.

00:12:13.920 --> 00:12:14.840
Get some rest.

00:12:38.320 --> 00:12:40.320
Why are you the one

00:12:41.280 --> 00:12:42.160
Not you.

00:12:45.200 --> 00:12:47.080
Where are you taking me?

00:12:48.440 --> 00:12:49.570
We're almost there.

00:12:50.560 --> 00:12:51.490
Are we there yet?

00:12:51.600 --> 00:12:52.920
Almost there.

00:12:54.840 --> 00:12:55.720
Are you ready?

00:13:03.320 --> 00:13:05.080
What is this?

00:13:06.320 --> 00:13:07.960
This is our boss.

00:13:08.320 --> 00:13:10.680
to set it up for you.

00:13:11.440 --> 00:13:12.320
I thought

00:13:12.600 --> 00:13:14.860
Although there are many people in Peace,

00:13:15.040 --> 00:13:16.960
but not many young girls.

00:13:17.320 --> 00:13:20.960
I thought you had to find a place to stay.

00:13:20.960 --> 00:13:22.620
to observe these young women.

00:13:22.800 --> 00:13:24.440
and talk to

00:13:24.440 --> 00:13:25.960
with these young girls.

00:13:28.440 --> 00:13:30.400
I can find a place.

00:13:30.800 --> 00:13:32.600
If you don't patrol the streets,

00:13:32.800 --> 00:13:34.330
and bring your delinquents

00:13:34.800 --> 00:13:36.160
with your delinquents?

00:13:36.440 --> 00:13:37.800
I've already set it up.

00:13:37.800 --> 00:13:39.600
Can't you say something nice?

00:13:40.840 --> 00:13:42.200
How much is this stall?

00:13:42.400 --> 00:13:43.400
I'll pay you back.

00:13:46.160 --> 00:13:46.920
Xu Ziqi.

00:13:48.040 --> 00:13:49.400
Don't be too nice to me.

00:13:50.440 --> 00:13:51.200
Understand?

00:13:53.920 --> 00:13:55.320
Why am I so nice to you?

00:13:55.680 --> 00:13:56.320
I...

00:13:57.040 --> 00:13:58.320
I want to protect Chang'an.

00:13:58.320 --> 00:14:00.200
The people of Chang'an are my family.

00:14:00.200 --> 00:14:01.560
You also live in Chang'an.

00:14:01.560 --> 00:14:02.960
So you are also my family.

00:14:04.480 --> 00:14:05.680
I'm serious.

00:14:09.320 --> 00:14:09.680
Boss.

00:14:33.160 --> 00:14:34.960
Don't be sad.

00:14:35.680 --> 00:14:37.480
This is not the time to be sad.

00:14:39.440 --> 00:14:41.440
When the Oiran has finally tried it,

00:14:42.080 --> 00:14:43.410
think about this again.

00:14:49.480 --> 00:14:50.560
This stall

00:14:51.280 --> 00:14:52.080
is not bad.

00:14:52.840 --> 00:14:53.800
Don't waste it.

00:15:16.480 --> 00:15:17.800
Come on

00:15:17.800 --> 00:15:20.080
Don't miss it.

00:15:20.320 --> 00:15:22.400
New costume design.

00:15:22.720 --> 00:15:23.800
Come on

00:15:23.800 --> 00:15:26.320
We can design any style.

00:15:26.720 --> 00:15:29.400
Free Free Free

00:15:30.040 --> 00:15:31.080
Come on

00:15:33.080 --> 00:15:34.080
One by one.

00:15:34.400 --> 00:15:35.330
Let me try first.

00:15:36.680 --> 00:15:37.400
Miss Jin'er.

00:15:37.400 --> 00:15:39.160
You must drink this wine.

00:15:39.160 --> 00:15:39.680
You must drink it.

00:15:39.680 --> 00:15:40.400
Come on.

00:15:40.480 --> 00:15:41.720
Tonight,

00:15:41.920 --> 00:15:44.040
have drunk Jin'er a few jars of wine.

00:15:44.560 --> 00:15:47.320
Now I have to drink three cups in a row.

00:15:47.720 --> 00:15:48.560
You have to drink.

00:15:48.560 --> 00:15:48.960
Drink it.

00:15:48.960 --> 00:15:49.600
Drink. Here.

00:15:49.600 --> 00:15:50.160
Don't say anything else.

00:15:50.160 --> 00:15:51.200
Let's drink.

00:16:08.440 --> 00:16:09.080
Brother.

00:16:16.280 --> 00:16:17.720
Have you changed?

00:16:19.400 --> 00:16:21.960
Maybe I'm getting stronger

00:16:22.200 --> 00:16:23.480
a little younger.

00:16:26.080 --> 00:16:27.200
A little younger.

00:16:28.080 --> 00:16:29.560
and stronger,

00:16:32.400 --> 00:16:35.200
can you bring your brothers to ruin my place?

00:16:43.320 --> 00:16:44.160
Jin'er!

00:16:44.560 --> 00:16:46.320
10,000 taels of gold.

00:16:46.680 --> 00:16:48.040
I have a lot of gold.

00:16:48.280 --> 00:16:49.160
As long as you want it,

00:16:49.160 --> 00:16:50.220
As long as I have it.

00:16:50.320 --> 00:16:51.600
If you want to win the Oiran,

00:16:51.600 --> 00:16:53.130
I'll help you get the Oiran.

00:16:53.560 --> 00:16:56.440
I just don't want others to make you drink.

00:16:57.080 --> 00:16:58.720
As long as I am here,

00:16:58.960 --> 00:17:00.400
these despicable people

00:17:00.800 --> 00:17:02.600
You don't have to come

00:17:02.960 --> 00:17:04.560
you don't have to come again.

00:17:07.200 --> 00:17:09.200
If you're too shy to listen, get out.

00:17:10.000 --> 00:17:12.000
I have something to say to your boss.

00:17:13.000 --> 00:17:13.440
Go.

00:17:13.480 --> 00:17:14.359
Go.

00:17:21.960 --> 00:17:22.839
Zhang Gui Cai.

00:17:25.040 --> 00:17:25.960
Do you know

00:17:27.440 --> 00:17:28.880
how I grew up?

00:17:31.840 --> 00:17:32.680
I know it well.

00:17:34.360 --> 00:17:35.240
You mean

00:17:35.960 --> 00:17:37.640
you're from a brothel,

00:17:38.200 --> 00:17:39.960
So you can't be with me?

00:17:40.480 --> 00:17:41.480
You're right.

00:17:42.680 --> 00:17:44.880
I'm a girl from the willow alley.

00:17:45.440 --> 00:17:46.520
Do you know

00:17:46.520 --> 00:17:49.920
what the rules

00:17:50.720 --> 00:17:52.180
of women in Floral Street?

00:17:54.520 --> 00:17:55.640
To me,

00:17:56.880 --> 00:18:00.680
everything is a price-bidding deal.

00:18:01.240 --> 00:18:03.960
Now you give me 10,000 taels of gold

00:18:06.840 --> 00:18:07.840
I don’t know

00:18:07.840 --> 00:18:09.960
what valuable things I should give you.

00:18:09.960 --> 00:18:11.760
Jin'er, you don't understand.

00:18:12.680 --> 00:18:13.640
Take the gold.

00:18:13.720 --> 00:18:14.840
I don't want anything.

00:18:14.840 --> 00:18:16.700
You don't understand what I mean.

00:18:18.160 --> 00:18:20.160
You said you wanted nothing from me.

00:18:20.920 --> 00:18:24.240
But you're thinking about being with me.

00:18:26.240 --> 00:18:28.040
I don't want to owe you anything.

00:18:28.200 --> 00:18:30.680
I don't want to make this deal, understand?

00:18:32.440 --> 00:18:34.840
Go back and be the head of the Carp Alliance.

00:18:36.120 --> 00:18:37.720
I don't want to see you again.

00:18:58.440 --> 00:18:59.680
I'll be back.

00:19:14.840 --> 00:19:15.370
Let's go.

00:19:35.760 --> 00:19:37.160
Alright, stop drinking.

00:19:41.520 --> 00:19:42.840
You heard

00:19:44.120 --> 00:19:45.200
what I just said?

00:19:45.520 --> 00:19:46.360
You're

00:19:47.000 --> 00:19:47.960
a bit harsh.

00:19:48.960 --> 00:19:51.120
Jang Gui-jae is not a bad guy.

00:19:54.960 --> 00:19:58.120
That's why I can't let him have hope.

00:19:58.920 --> 00:20:01.360
I can't use him

00:20:01.440 --> 00:20:02.440
by his love for me.

00:20:03.200 --> 00:20:05.200
What do you think? What do you think?

00:20:05.920 --> 00:20:07.000
What if

00:20:08.840 --> 00:20:10.760
lose this time?

00:20:12.920 --> 00:20:14.000
No way.

00:20:14.360 --> 00:20:15.440
Jin'er

00:20:15.440 --> 00:20:16.400
is the best.

00:20:16.840 --> 00:20:17.480
Hero.

00:20:18.040 --> 00:20:19.280
What if... What if...

00:20:20.200 --> 00:20:21.000
God

00:20:21.600 --> 00:20:23.040
has a better plan.

00:20:23.680 --> 00:20:24.760
Don't worry.

00:20:25.000 --> 00:20:26.640
I pray every day

00:20:26.880 --> 00:20:28.280
to give you a good result.

00:20:30.400 --> 00:20:31.280
I know

00:20:31.960 --> 00:20:34.040
what Hua Xiao Zheng does every day.

00:20:35.760 --> 00:20:37.160
She's really something.

00:20:38.400 --> 00:20:40.600
She can do so much

00:20:41.000 --> 00:20:42.200
for a poor girl.

00:20:42.440 --> 00:20:43.960
If I could

00:20:44.640 --> 00:20:46.600
in such a bad environment,

00:20:46.880 --> 00:20:49.200
in such a bad environment

00:20:52.200 --> 00:20:55.200
I might be comforted.

00:20:57.360 --> 00:20:58.640
At that time,

00:20:58.880 --> 00:21:00.200
[someone told me]

00:21:01.680 --> 00:21:03.000
that women's beauty

00:21:04.440 --> 00:21:06.680
not only to please men,

00:21:08.440 --> 00:21:10.440
but to make yourself happy.

00:21:12.480 --> 00:21:13.680
Many things

00:21:15.240 --> 00:21:16.680
will be different.

00:21:17.680 --> 00:21:18.840
I can't do

00:21:19.360 --> 00:21:21.000
what she did.

00:21:23.000 --> 00:21:23.760
She

00:21:25.760 --> 00:21:26.960
is quite amazing.

00:21:29.360 --> 00:21:30.960
Stop drinking.

00:21:34.120 --> 00:21:36.960
She's from a poor family.

00:21:38.760 --> 00:21:40.000
The path we took

00:21:41.120 --> 00:21:43.200
are two completely different paths.

00:21:44.360 --> 00:21:46.000
I really envy her.

00:22:01.440 --> 00:22:02.600
Get up, Hua Xiaochi.

00:22:03.440 --> 00:22:04.000
Get up.

00:22:06.920 --> 00:22:08.120
What are you doing?

00:22:08.400 --> 00:22:09.200
Wash up.

00:22:09.440 --> 00:22:10.900
Let me take you somewhere.

00:22:12.520 --> 00:22:14.120
Why are you smiling so weird?

00:22:14.840 --> 00:22:15.640
I'm not going.

00:22:15.680 --> 00:22:16.200
No.

00:22:16.280 --> 00:22:18.040
We have to go now.

00:22:21.640 --> 00:22:22.440
Let's go.

00:22:29.000 --> 00:22:29.520
This...

00:22:30.400 --> 00:22:31.200
These days,

00:22:31.440 --> 00:22:32.040
these days.

00:22:32.040 --> 00:22:34.160
designing clothes for poor women.

00:22:34.440 --> 00:22:36.120
and became famous.

00:22:36.200 --> 00:22:38.440
These are all

00:22:38.440 --> 00:22:40.240
by those girls.

00:22:41.160 --> 00:22:42.880
Zheng, three days later,

00:22:43.520 --> 00:22:44.360
maybe

00:22:45.000 --> 00:22:46.800
you can really defeat Gu Jin'er.

00:22:51.720 --> 00:22:53.280
Zheng, what's wrong?

00:22:59.440 --> 00:23:01.720
Xu Ziqi, you know what?

00:23:02.000 --> 00:23:04.000
I wanted to give up countless times.

00:23:04.440 --> 00:23:05.880
But I told myself

00:23:06.360 --> 00:23:07.360
I can lose.

00:23:07.680 --> 00:23:09.000
but I can't give up.

00:23:10.640 --> 00:23:11.880
I did it.

00:23:12.840 --> 00:23:14.040
I'm happy for you too.

00:23:19.960 --> 00:23:21.880
We're happy for you too.

00:23:24.680 --> 00:23:25.440
Look.

00:23:25.600 --> 00:23:26.400
Yes. Yes.

00:23:30.200 --> 00:23:30.960
Brother Xu.

00:23:31.440 --> 00:23:33.400
Good brother.

00:23:34.160 --> 00:23:36.760
It's all thanks to Hua.

00:23:36.920 --> 00:23:38.480
You're welcome.

00:23:39.160 --> 00:23:41.720
You're the elder brother and I'm the younger sister.

00:23:41.720 --> 00:23:43.160
I'll do whatever you say.

00:23:43.200 --> 00:23:44.000
Well...

00:23:44.600 --> 00:23:46.120
It's a nice day.

00:23:46.200 --> 00:23:47.960
We can't wait for our precious time.

00:23:47.960 --> 00:23:49.040
How about we

00:23:49.200 --> 00:23:50.930
have a drink at the restaurant?

00:23:51.000 --> 00:23:52.760
Okay, I'll listen to you.

00:24:04.440 --> 00:24:06.680
Mr. Xu, this is a wine pot

00:24:06.680 --> 00:24:08.840
according to your preferences.

00:24:08.920 --> 00:24:10.000
Enjoy.

00:24:15.760 --> 00:24:17.760
Mine is a koi.

00:24:19.040 --> 00:24:20.200
Mine is a big Qilin.

00:24:21.000 --> 00:24:22.600
The small one is cute.

00:24:26.680 --> 00:24:27.360
Good wine.

00:24:31.720 --> 00:24:32.280
Here.

00:24:32.600 --> 00:24:33.200
Here.

00:24:44.240 --> 00:24:45.040
Cheers.

00:25:00.200 --> 00:25:01.280
Coming.

00:25:04.680 --> 00:25:05.240
Mr. Xu.

00:25:05.240 --> 00:25:06.880
This is your wine. Enjoy.

00:25:08.760 --> 00:25:09.440
Cheers.

00:25:09.680 --> 00:25:10.680
We're out of wine.

00:25:11.280 --> 00:25:12.480
There is.

00:25:13.640 --> 00:25:14.880
You two are drinking well.

00:25:14.880 --> 00:25:16.760
I didn't know you can really drink.

00:25:16.760 --> 00:25:17.440
Yeah.

00:25:17.520 --> 00:25:17.960
Yes.

00:25:20.480 --> 00:25:23.200
What are you?

00:25:23.200 --> 00:25:25.680
I'm a little koi.

00:25:26.360 --> 00:25:27.440
I am

00:25:28.240 --> 00:25:29.680
Big Qilin.

00:25:30.600 --> 00:25:32.440
Cheers.

00:25:33.200 --> 00:25:33.880
Boss.

00:25:34.280 --> 00:25:36.480
I didn't know Yama could smile.

00:25:36.720 --> 00:25:38.160
And his smile is so pretty.

00:25:38.160 --> 00:25:39.640
Like spring flowers

00:25:40.160 --> 00:25:40.760
Cheers

00:25:45.120 --> 00:25:46.120
What about there?

00:25:46.640 --> 00:25:47.400
Over there.

00:25:47.480 --> 00:25:47.920
Go!

00:25:48.640 --> 00:25:49.170
Let's go.

00:25:55.120 --> 00:25:56.000
Come on.

00:25:56.160 --> 00:25:56.620
This...

00:25:56.680 --> 00:25:57.400
Cheers.

00:25:57.600 --> 00:25:59.920
But isn't it too cheerful

00:25:59.960 --> 00:26:02.280
You scared the customers

00:26:02.640 --> 00:26:03.440
Cheers.

00:26:04.240 --> 00:26:04.920
Cheers!

00:26:07.160 --> 00:26:08.440
You can't stop him.

00:26:08.960 --> 00:26:10.640
It's rare that you're so happy today.

00:26:10.640 --> 00:26:11.640
Let him be.

00:26:12.720 --> 00:26:15.000
Go after him.

00:26:15.520 --> 00:26:15.960
Lord Xu.

00:26:15.960 --> 00:26:17.090
Be careful, Lord Xu.

00:26:17.120 --> 00:26:18.200
Be careful.

00:26:18.720 --> 00:26:21.200
Go after them!

00:26:21.520 --> 00:26:22.720
Be careful.

00:26:23.880 --> 00:26:25.160
Go after them!

00:26:25.880 --> 00:26:26.360
Be careful.

00:26:26.360 --> 00:26:28.880
Why is my little koi walking so slowly?

00:26:32.240 --> 00:26:33.480
So beautiful.

00:26:33.480 --> 00:26:34.160
Lou wine Lai Fu

00:26:34.160 --> 00:26:37.040
I've never seen the moon so close.

00:26:37.040 --> 00:26:39.680
Lou wine Lai Fu

00:26:40.200 --> 00:26:41.520
You worship the moon

00:26:42.000 --> 00:26:43.600
May all your wishes come true

00:26:48.760 --> 00:26:50.400
God bless us.

00:26:51.000 --> 00:26:52.920
Protect Hua Xiao Zheng!

00:26:53.360 --> 00:26:55.200
and become the Oiran.

00:26:55.200 --> 00:26:56.600
Stay in Chang'an.

00:26:57.480 --> 00:26:58.720
Get rich.

00:27:01.680 --> 00:27:02.960
We must be rich.

00:27:04.760 --> 00:27:06.000
We must be rich.

00:27:06.280 --> 00:27:08.400
Get rich.

00:27:10.200 --> 00:27:11.000
Then...

00:27:13.240 --> 00:27:14.480
After getting rich?

00:27:14.960 --> 00:27:16.440
After getting rich

00:27:17.440 --> 00:27:21.640
I wish I could be rich.

00:27:21.640 --> 00:27:23.370
I didn't think about the future

00:27:23.680 --> 00:27:24.720
Now I feel

00:27:25.880 --> 00:27:27.010
after getting rich,

00:27:27.680 --> 00:27:28.960
I thought the same way.

00:27:30.040 --> 00:27:31.160
Just like me.

00:27:33.400 --> 00:27:34.660
I want to do more things

00:27:35.200 --> 00:27:37.640
to do more things for more people.

00:27:40.880 --> 00:27:41.760
What about you?

00:27:42.760 --> 00:27:43.960
What do you want to do?

00:27:45.960 --> 00:27:47.040
Me?

00:27:50.760 --> 00:27:53.400
I couldn't figure out

00:27:53.960 --> 00:27:55.680
why I came to Chang'an.

00:27:57.440 --> 00:27:59.960
I kind of understand now.

00:28:00.760 --> 00:28:02.280
And I don't want to go back.

00:28:03.280 --> 00:28:06.280
Because I'm happy here.

00:28:06.600 --> 00:28:08.460
I'm doing something meaningful.

00:28:08.920 --> 00:28:11.720
I won't be alone anymore.

00:28:11.840 --> 00:28:12.840
I still have...

00:28:13.640 --> 00:28:14.440
What else?

00:28:17.680 --> 00:28:20.040
I still care about someone.

00:28:33.200 --> 00:28:35.960
Chang'an is built by every citizen.

00:28:36.920 --> 00:28:38.680
Not Chang'an.

00:28:39.640 --> 00:28:41.240
Because of them,

00:28:41.600 --> 00:28:43.200
this is Chang'an.

00:28:46.200 --> 00:28:47.000
Yes.

00:28:47.600 --> 00:28:48.400
So,

00:28:48.840 --> 00:28:50.880
I will do my best

00:28:51.520 --> 00:28:53.000
to protect the people

00:28:54.360 --> 00:28:55.400
and peace.

00:28:56.760 --> 00:28:57.600
Because

00:28:59.120 --> 00:29:00.880
this is our Chang'an.

00:29:04.200 --> 00:29:07.120
Yes, this is our Chang'an.

00:29:20.960 --> 00:29:21.920
Are we going to

00:29:22.160 --> 00:29:25.040
to make a new Oiran embroidery this year?

00:29:25.400 --> 00:29:26.240
Master Yi,

00:29:26.440 --> 00:29:28.960
Which country girl are you going to promote?

00:29:29.360 --> 00:29:31.640
She's so popular now.

00:29:32.040 --> 00:29:33.680
She's already tied up with Gu Jin'er

00:29:33.680 --> 00:29:35.760
we're already tied with Gu Jin'er.

00:29:37.600 --> 00:29:40.000
How much money did we spend in the election?

00:29:42.160 --> 00:29:44.360
It costs 110,000 taels of gold

00:29:44.360 --> 00:29:46.520
30,000 taels more than last year

00:29:47.200 --> 00:29:48.730
Lord Wu is already unhappy.

00:29:49.360 --> 00:29:50.820
The money for the election

00:29:50.920 --> 00:29:51.680
from filial piety.

00:29:51.680 --> 00:29:53.480
from Lord Wu.

00:29:54.160 --> 00:29:56.640
If Hua Xiaochi's ticket goes up,

00:29:57.200 --> 00:29:59.400
we have to put more money in it.

00:30:00.520 --> 00:30:01.680
Then Gu Jin'er

00:30:01.880 --> 00:30:03.760
become a losing deal?

00:30:04.680 --> 00:30:06.440
Master Yi is right.

00:30:07.440 --> 00:30:09.040
I don't care who the Oiran is.

00:30:09.040 --> 00:30:11.360
as long as she can help us earn money.

00:30:12.840 --> 00:30:15.360
But Hua Xiao Zheng is too disobedient.

00:30:16.120 --> 00:30:17.520
He needs to be treated.

00:30:19.000 --> 00:30:21.280
I will talk to Hua

00:30:21.400 --> 00:30:24.440
I heard that girl has always loved you.

00:30:24.840 --> 00:30:27.480
She tried her best to stay by your side.

00:30:28.640 --> 00:30:29.440
Yes.

00:30:30.880 --> 00:30:33.040
Well, being the Oiran

00:30:33.200 --> 00:30:35.840
I can stay by your side.

00:30:36.360 --> 00:30:37.440
and win her over.

00:30:38.240 --> 00:30:39.280
Marry her.

00:30:39.840 --> 00:30:41.200
or make her promise,

00:30:41.440 --> 00:30:43.200
Let her be loyal to you

00:30:43.520 --> 00:30:45.400
and the Chamber of Commerce.

00:30:48.440 --> 00:30:49.720
I will do my best.

00:30:50.640 --> 00:30:51.520
Thank you, Master Yi.

00:30:51.520 --> 00:30:55.600
Remember what we want is to be devoted.

00:30:57.480 --> 00:30:58.280
Understood.

00:31:01.840 --> 00:31:02.520
Here you go.

00:31:02.760 --> 00:31:03.880
Please.

00:31:05.600 --> 00:31:07.000
My lord, this way please.

00:31:09.040 --> 00:31:10.400
This is the west wing.

00:31:12.640 --> 00:31:13.680
My lord, come with me.

00:31:13.680 --> 00:31:14.400
Nice.

00:31:16.040 --> 00:31:16.880
Please.

00:31:24.160 --> 00:31:25.160
It's really nice.

00:31:26.400 --> 00:31:28.330
Your Excellency, this way please.

00:31:33.000 --> 00:31:35.400
Your Excellency, this house is exquisite and elegant.

00:31:35.400 --> 00:31:36.280
Birds and flowers.

00:31:36.280 --> 00:31:37.680
Are you satisfied?

00:31:39.120 --> 00:31:39.920
Indeed.

00:31:42.160 --> 00:31:42.840
But

00:31:43.480 --> 00:31:45.440
I've been really shy lately.

00:31:53.960 --> 00:31:54.760
This is...

00:31:56.840 --> 00:31:58.040
These three trophies

00:31:58.440 --> 00:32:00.200
are very precious to me.

00:32:00.960 --> 00:32:04.040
I don't know if I can use it as a penalty.

00:32:05.640 --> 00:32:08.200
Sir, as long as you like this house.

00:32:08.440 --> 00:32:10.440
You can take as much as you can.

00:32:10.680 --> 00:32:12.140
As for these three things,

00:32:12.440 --> 00:32:14.500
those are your most precious things.

00:32:14.720 --> 00:32:16.040
I dare not accept it.

00:32:16.840 --> 00:32:17.640
Please don't.

00:32:22.440 --> 00:32:23.960
My lord, this is the deed.

00:32:24.000 --> 00:32:24.860
Please keep it.

00:32:30.840 --> 00:32:32.600
Lord Xu may not remember me.

00:32:32.840 --> 00:32:34.720
My grandmother was seriously ill.

00:32:34.720 --> 00:32:36.840
My family couldn't afford to treat her.

00:32:36.840 --> 00:32:38.000
Thanks to your help,

00:32:38.440 --> 00:32:40.400
granny was able to stay alive.

00:32:40.840 --> 00:32:41.640
I will never

00:32:41.840 --> 00:32:43.400
your kindness.

00:32:45.200 --> 00:32:46.000
No way.

00:32:46.640 --> 00:32:47.900
If you don't accept it,

00:32:48.640 --> 00:32:49.970
I won't take this house.

00:32:54.680 --> 00:32:57.160
Then I'll take one. What do you think?

00:32:59.840 --> 00:33:00.680
Choose one.

00:33:04.360 --> 00:33:07.040
This trophy doesn't look expensive.

00:33:12.520 --> 00:33:13.440
A golden man.

00:33:14.120 --> 00:33:15.920
It's bad luck to leave it at home.

00:33:19.840 --> 00:33:20.440
Bad luck.

00:33:21.000 --> 00:33:22.520
This golden bear is not bad.

00:33:22.520 --> 00:33:23.440
It's vivid.

00:33:23.920 --> 00:33:25.160
Sir, I want it.

00:33:28.960 --> 00:33:29.760
Thank you.

00:33:30.840 --> 00:33:31.770
You're welcome.

00:33:32.160 --> 00:33:34.000
You are in such a hurry to buy the property.

00:33:34.000 --> 00:33:35.400
Are you getting married?

00:33:36.840 --> 00:33:37.970
Prepare in advance.

00:33:38.040 --> 00:33:39.170
Prepare in advance.

00:33:39.200 --> 00:33:40.400
The girl you like

00:33:40.440 --> 00:33:42.000
must be the best girl in the world.

00:33:42.000 --> 00:33:43.730
I congratulate you in advance.

00:33:44.440 --> 00:33:45.440
The best girl.

00:33:47.720 --> 00:33:48.520
Thank you.

00:34:30.239 --> 00:34:31.000
That's it.

00:34:31.719 --> 00:34:32.159
Okay.

00:34:34.280 --> 00:34:36.610
It's so beautiful. It's so well designed.

00:34:36.639 --> 00:34:37.719
Look at the color.

00:34:38.840 --> 00:34:40.239
It's so well matched.

00:34:40.600 --> 00:34:41.440
Like this.

00:34:42.440 --> 00:34:44.120
Why are you here?

00:34:44.360 --> 00:34:45.360
You can leave now.

00:34:45.480 --> 00:34:46.280
Let's go.

00:34:46.880 --> 00:34:47.440
Well...

00:34:47.960 --> 00:34:49.320
Let's call it a day.

00:34:49.440 --> 00:34:50.760
Come back tomorrow

00:34:51.239 --> 00:34:52.280
Come and line up early.

00:34:52.280 --> 00:34:53.040
Let's go.

00:34:53.440 --> 00:34:56.239
Hua Xiaochi, our lord came to you today

00:34:56.360 --> 00:34:58.220
to tell you something important.

00:34:58.240 --> 00:34:59.360
No way.

00:35:00.000 --> 00:35:02.320
Tomorrow is the final test of the Oiran.

00:35:02.440 --> 00:35:05.720
Are you here to persuade me to give up?

00:35:05.960 --> 00:35:06.800
No.

00:35:07.480 --> 00:35:08.600
I'm here to tell you that

00:35:08.600 --> 00:35:10.200
I support you to be the Oiran.

00:35:10.720 --> 00:35:12.960
And I want to be with you.

00:35:16.040 --> 00:35:18.040
Xu Ziqi, why are you here?

00:35:18.440 --> 00:35:19.120
Li,

00:35:19.520 --> 00:35:21.440
Didn't you disapprove of Xiao Zheng to be the Oiran?

00:35:21.440 --> 00:35:23.040
Why did you change your mind?

00:35:24.360 --> 00:35:25.560
That's not the point.

00:35:26.520 --> 00:35:27.760
Answer me first.

00:35:27.920 --> 00:35:29.560
What do you mean

00:35:30.840 --> 00:35:32.440
Be with me?

00:35:34.160 --> 00:35:34.960
Zheng.

00:35:35.160 --> 00:35:37.880
I can only focus on the Chamber of Commerce

00:35:38.440 --> 00:35:40.600
I can only focus on the Chamber of Commerce.

00:35:40.600 --> 00:35:43.240
The Chamber of Commerce keeps saying that you are not allowed to be the Oiran.

00:35:43.240 --> 00:35:44.240
I can’t object.

00:35:44.560 --> 00:35:47.120
But now the Chamber of Commerce

00:35:47.120 --> 00:35:48.000
has changed.

00:35:48.440 --> 00:35:50.170
You have people’s support now.

00:35:50.240 --> 00:35:52.520
The Chamber of Commerce thinks you can be the Oiran.

00:35:52.520 --> 00:35:55.160
I can stand by your side and support you.

00:35:56.240 --> 00:35:58.240
Forget about the Chamber of Commerce,

00:35:58.240 --> 00:36:00.080
will you support me to be the Oiran?

00:36:00.080 --> 00:36:02.880
No matter you become the Oiran or not,

00:36:03.400 --> 00:36:04.530
I will take you back.

00:36:07.400 --> 00:36:08.440
Wait.

00:36:08.840 --> 00:36:10.500
This is too much information.

00:36:10.800 --> 00:36:12.360
I need to think about it.

00:36:15.920 --> 00:36:16.560
Zheng.

00:36:17.120 --> 00:36:18.320
I want to be with you

00:36:18.800 --> 00:36:20.840
Even if there are thorns ahead

00:36:21.320 --> 00:36:23.120
Even if everyone tries to stop me

00:36:23.280 --> 00:36:25.480
Even if my hair turns grey

00:36:25.600 --> 00:36:26.440
Xiao Zheng.

00:36:27.000 --> 00:36:28.840
Don't talk first.

00:36:28.960 --> 00:36:31.400
Let me think about it.

00:36:32.760 --> 00:36:35.440
Your future husband is powerful

00:36:35.440 --> 00:36:36.720
He has a great waist.

00:36:36.760 --> 00:36:37.960
He is upright.

00:36:37.960 --> 00:36:39.400
and handsome.

00:36:40.120 --> 00:36:42.760
In Chang'an,

00:36:43.240 --> 00:36:45.800
in Chang'an.

00:36:46.000 --> 00:36:47.160
Most importantly,

00:36:47.440 --> 00:36:49.320
you must choose the right one.

00:36:49.320 --> 00:36:52.000
Otherwise, it will affect your whole body.

00:36:52.520 --> 00:36:54.480
there will be many victims.

00:36:55.320 --> 00:36:56.600
Many

00:36:57.760 --> 00:36:59.080
many.

00:36:59.080 --> 00:36:59.800
Xiao Zheng.

00:36:59.920 --> 00:37:00.600
Hua Xiao Zheng!

00:37:00.600 --> 00:37:01.520
My love for you

00:37:01.880 --> 00:37:04.880
I really love you.

00:37:10.120 --> 00:37:11.320
I'll go back with you.

00:37:11.600 --> 00:37:12.320
What?

00:37:16.440 --> 00:37:17.280
Release?

00:37:17.960 --> 00:37:19.960
I'll go back to the mansion with you.

00:37:20.240 --> 00:37:21.000
Let's go.

00:37:37.920 --> 00:37:39.400
Wait.

00:37:39.600 --> 00:37:41.760
I'll sleep in my old room.

00:37:42.840 --> 00:37:43.600
Why?

00:37:44.160 --> 00:37:45.960
You've been craving for my body.

00:37:51.400 --> 00:37:52.320
In your eyes,

00:37:52.920 --> 00:37:54.880
I am still

00:37:55.480 --> 00:37:57.080
like a wolf.

00:38:02.240 --> 00:38:03.840
If this is the way you like,

00:38:04.160 --> 00:38:05.890
you can keep acting like a wolf.

00:38:05.920 --> 00:38:08.120
I'll learn how to act like a wolf.

00:38:11.400 --> 00:38:13.200
Don't make it hard for yourself.

00:38:13.240 --> 00:38:14.370
We can take our time.

00:38:15.240 --> 00:38:16.770
Don't rush to share the bed.

00:38:17.000 --> 00:38:18.040
Step by step.

00:38:24.560 --> 00:38:26.620
You're the one who harassed me first.

00:38:30.480 --> 00:38:32.840
I have to clarify this.

00:38:33.280 --> 00:38:35.960
We used to sleep together.

00:38:37.120 --> 00:38:39.400
not together.

00:38:41.840 --> 00:38:42.900
Do you understand?

00:38:46.160 --> 00:38:50.080
"The one who is in the middle of the night" "is in the middle of the night." "The person is in the middle of the night."

00:38:50.080 --> 00:38:50.920
My lord.

00:38:51.400 --> 00:38:53.040
You're right.

00:38:53.480 --> 00:38:55.540
Don't sleep together in such a hurry.

00:38:55.600 --> 00:38:57.200
You're used to living alone.

00:38:57.400 --> 00:38:59.520
And Ms. Zheng is so noisy.

00:39:00.000 --> 00:39:01.960
What should we do

00:39:02.440 --> 00:39:03.560
what should we do?

00:39:05.920 --> 00:39:06.920
That makes sense.

00:39:07.480 --> 00:39:08.320
Well,

00:39:10.440 --> 00:39:11.840
let's sleep separately.

00:39:14.600 --> 00:39:15.640
Rest early.

00:39:15.920 --> 00:39:17.320
I'm going back to my room.

00:39:17.880 --> 00:39:18.880
You too.

00:39:23.880 --> 00:39:24.560
Zheng.

00:40:01.280 --> 00:40:01.880
My lord.

00:40:02.880 --> 00:40:03.920
Let's go.

00:40:22.240 --> 00:40:23.000
My lord.

00:40:23.760 --> 00:40:24.960
I'm very happy.

00:40:26.240 --> 00:40:28.500
Since my mother was exiled to the border,

00:40:29.040 --> 00:40:30.560
no one has ever hugged me.

00:40:32.840 --> 00:40:33.840
I almost forgot

00:40:34.840 --> 00:40:36.240
Hugging is so reassuring

00:40:37.160 --> 00:40:38.080
It's so warm.

00:40:41.080 --> 00:40:41.760
My lord.

00:40:44.800 --> 00:40:45.560
Go away!

00:40:46.600 --> 00:40:47.440
Yes, my lord.

00:40:55.840 --> 00:40:57.600
My lord, you still have the mood to cook?

00:40:57.600 --> 00:40:59.160
Why are you hiding here?

00:40:59.240 --> 00:41:00.640
You have to take her away.

00:41:00.800 --> 00:41:01.560
Miss Xiao,

00:41:01.560 --> 00:41:03.440
You haven't married Mr. Fang yet, have you?

00:41:03.440 --> 00:41:04.800
Yes, you still have a chance.

00:41:04.800 --> 00:41:05.880
That's right.

00:41:06.000 --> 00:41:07.640
She's already in the house.

00:41:07.800 --> 00:41:09.040
What's the difference between this and marriage?

00:41:09.040 --> 00:41:09.440
No.

00:41:09.600 --> 00:41:10.400
But this is not an adult.

00:41:10.400 --> 00:41:11.840
You don't even have a chance

00:41:11.840 --> 00:41:13.800
to show your heart to Ms. Zheng?

00:41:14.360 --> 00:41:14.960
Yes.

00:41:15.080 --> 00:41:16.960
She already chose to divorce.

00:41:16.960 --> 00:41:18.960
What's the point of asking her again?

00:41:18.960 --> 00:41:20.400
You didn't say anything.

00:41:20.600 --> 00:41:21.400
Ms. Zheng,

00:41:21.400 --> 00:41:23.240
can only choose Mr. Fang.

00:41:23.440 --> 00:41:23.640
Yes.

00:41:23.640 --> 00:41:24.920
If you were brave

00:41:24.920 --> 00:41:26.240
to propose,

00:41:26.320 --> 00:41:27.980
the result will be different.

00:41:28.120 --> 00:41:30.440
You have two choices.

00:41:32.320 --> 00:41:33.320
You mean

00:41:33.760 --> 00:41:35.490
no matter what choice she made,

00:41:35.840 --> 00:41:37.120
I should propose to her.

00:41:37.120 --> 00:41:38.400
That's right.

00:41:38.480 --> 00:41:41.410
Your Excellency, you are very brave to kill enemies.

00:41:41.480 --> 00:41:42.720
In a relationship,

00:41:42.920 --> 00:41:45.000
you should be braver.

00:41:48.560 --> 00:41:49.620
Then I'll propose.

00:41:50.000 --> 00:41:50.840
When?

00:41:51.840 --> 00:41:53.320
The Oiran competition is over.

00:41:53.320 --> 00:41:54.920
no matter what the result is,

00:41:54.920 --> 00:41:55.720
I'll propose.

00:41:55.920 --> 00:41:56.440
Okay.

00:41:57.360 --> 00:41:58.960
Don't crawl this time.

00:41:59.160 --> 00:42:00.000
No.

00:42:34.080 --> 00:42:35.000
If

00:42:35.960 --> 00:42:38.720
my choice is right,

00:42:40.400 --> 00:42:42.360
Why do I feel

00:42:42.600 --> 00:42:44.280
feel empty?

00:43:19.560 --> 00:43:20.800
My lord

00:43:20.880 --> 00:43:23.280
the golden thread threads made overnight.

00:43:23.400 --> 00:43:25.600
The best craftsmanship in Tang.

00:43:27.040 --> 00:43:28.040
This dress?

00:43:28.240 --> 00:43:30.300
is more than a thousand taels of gold.

00:43:31.440 --> 00:43:32.960
Thousand taels of gold?

00:43:33.160 --> 00:43:33.600
Yes.

00:43:34.000 --> 00:43:34.840
And this.

00:43:35.280 --> 00:43:37.600
My lord found this in the warehouse.

00:43:37.600 --> 00:43:38.760
from the warehouse.

00:43:43.960 --> 00:43:46.490
This is the jade on the Empress of Sui dynasty.

00:43:46.520 --> 00:43:47.640
I found it

00:43:48.040 --> 00:43:50.480
to make it into a hairpin.

00:43:53.080 --> 00:43:55.320
is worth a lot.

00:43:56.240 --> 00:43:57.360
So beautiful.

00:44:02.760 --> 00:44:03.520
Then...

00:44:04.080 --> 00:44:05.440
They are...

00:44:07.040 --> 00:44:09.440
They are the courtesans I found for you.

00:44:09.760 --> 00:44:10.690
and Ling people.

00:44:10.960 --> 00:44:11.880
These dancers

00:44:12.480 --> 00:44:13.440
were

00:44:14.040 --> 00:44:15.320
dance in the palace.

00:44:15.800 --> 00:44:18.440
And these elites often go to the palace to serve

00:44:19.080 --> 00:44:20.960
They are all very skilled.

00:44:23.440 --> 00:44:24.440
Awesome.

00:44:25.120 --> 00:44:26.040
This formation

00:44:27.160 --> 00:44:28.720
is too much.

00:44:30.280 --> 00:44:32.760
You're running for the Oiran Competition.

00:44:32.960 --> 00:44:35.440
And this round is about costumes.

00:44:36.160 --> 00:44:37.600
in this round.

00:44:38.440 --> 00:44:40.000
I prepared something for you.

00:44:40.000 --> 00:44:42.520
Whether it's valuable or precious,

00:44:42.720 --> 00:44:43.960
than Gu Jin'er.

00:44:44.400 --> 00:44:45.730
As long as you wear them,

00:44:46.360 --> 00:44:48.890
those dignitaries will fall in love with you.

00:44:48.960 --> 00:44:50.480
and build a momentum for you.

00:44:50.480 --> 00:44:52.940
Plus the people you've accumulated before,

00:44:52.960 --> 00:44:54.290
the Oiran Competition.

00:44:54.520 --> 00:44:56.050
The victory is in our hands.

00:45:02.800 --> 00:45:04.240
Will you win

00:45:05.600 --> 00:45:06.880
with these?

00:45:07.120 --> 00:45:08.000
We will win.

00:45:16.560 --> 00:45:17.400
I'll win.

00:45:17.920 --> 00:45:18.720
Thank you.

00:45:19.840 --> 00:45:21.000
But these

00:45:21.600 --> 00:45:23.440
I shouldn't show them.

00:45:30.040 --> 00:45:31.240
Sir.

00:45:31.240 --> 00:45:32.970
You're leaving just like that?

00:45:49.240 --> 00:45:51.960
Tonight is the annual

00:45:52.000 --> 00:45:54.880
