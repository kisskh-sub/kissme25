00:01:38.706 --> 00:01:39.747
The economy is struggling.

00:01:40.506 --> 00:01:42.168
We have no money
for building Yuehai City.

00:01:42.426 --> 00:01:42.946
So,

00:01:43.706 --> 00:01:44.946
the town Part committee

00:01:45.506 --> 00:01:47.146
has decided to impose

00:01:47.506 --> 00:01:48.506
a city construction fee.

00:01:49.226 --> 00:01:49.827
Mr. Zheng,

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:53.426
(Land Use Certificate)
what about the land use certificates?

00:01:54.747 --> 00:01:55.346
Mr. Cai,

00:01:56.187 --> 00:01:58.387
is there an issue
with these land use certificates?

00:01:58.706 --> 00:01:59.667
From what I understand,

00:02:00.586 --> 00:02:01.907
our County Land Bureau

00:02:01.946 --> 00:02:04.146
has never issued such certificates.

00:02:04.786 --> 00:02:06.426
Who designed these certificates?

00:02:07.992 --> 00:02:09.592
Those who paid the city construction fee

00:02:09.906 --> 00:02:11.107
and got household registration

00:02:11.547 --> 00:02:13.107
need a certificate from us.

00:02:13.706 --> 00:02:16.306
So we designed
these land use certificates.

00:02:16.947 --> 00:02:17.947
But don't worry,

00:02:18.306 --> 00:02:20.827
we've applied to the County Land Bureau.

00:02:21.227 --> 00:02:22.186
Once approved,

00:02:22.466 --> 00:02:24.547
we'll replace them
with official land certificates.

00:02:28.466 --> 00:02:30.146
Regardless
of the certificate's compliance,

00:02:30.586 --> 00:02:34.067
collecting money from farmers
is land selling.

00:02:34.586 --> 00:02:35.947
This so-called 'construction fee'

00:02:36.107 --> 00:02:38.426
is just a pretext or an excuse

00:02:38.626 --> 00:02:39.947
circumventing the Constitution.

00:02:40.306 --> 00:02:40.866
Mr. Zheng,

00:02:41.466 --> 00:02:42.827
the nature is different.

00:02:42.947 --> 00:02:44.706
This is illegal. Do you understand?

00:02:46.067 --> 00:02:47.787
Are you here to investigate

00:02:48.107 --> 00:02:49.466
or to frame our cadres?

00:02:50.706 --> 00:02:52.227
I refuse this investigation.

00:02:52.827 --> 00:02:53.827
I'm going to the county.

00:02:54.186 --> 00:02:56.026
Someone in charge needs to hear us out.

00:02:56.267 --> 00:02:57.947
No one can help you, Mr. Zheng.

00:02:58.067 --> 00:03:00.507
Your actions constitute land selling.

00:03:04.067 --> 00:03:06.586
Higher authorities
gave Yuehai no construction funds.

00:03:07.026 --> 00:03:08.987
Do you know
how massive the expenses are?

00:03:09.626 --> 00:03:11.067
Do you have better solutions?

00:03:11.426 --> 00:03:13.987
You don't understand the difficulties.

00:03:14.426 --> 00:03:16.387
We know construction is challenging,

00:03:17.080 --> 00:03:18.520
but constitutional violations

00:03:18.746 --> 00:03:20.186
could halt the entire project.

00:03:20.547 --> 00:03:22.667
Your anger solves nothing, Mr. Zheng.

00:03:23.107 --> 00:03:25.706
Surely you didn't want this outcome?

00:03:26.186 --> 00:03:29.466
You must explain
the city construction fee.

00:03:37.626 --> 00:03:39.067
I have nothing to explain.

00:03:40.827 --> 00:03:41.947
I didn't sell any land.

00:03:43.507 --> 00:03:45.227
Then answer another question.

00:03:45.787 --> 00:03:48.626
You planned to collect city construction fees
from the 'monkeys.'

00:03:49.186 --> 00:03:50.787
Yet credit union records show

00:03:51.186 --> 00:03:52.387
you borrowed 300,000 yuan

00:03:52.547 --> 00:03:54.107
before collecting any fees.

00:03:54.507 --> 00:03:55.626
How do you explain this?

00:03:56.146 --> 00:03:56.646
Yes,

00:03:57.626 --> 00:03:59.267
I intended to collect
from the 'monkeys,'

00:03:59.866 --> 00:04:01.146
but it takes a good nest

00:04:01.387 --> 00:04:02.586
to attract the phoenix.

00:04:03.626 --> 00:04:04.746
So we took loans

00:04:05.387 --> 00:04:06.866
to build proper roads

00:04:07.466 --> 00:04:09.947
to entice the 'monkeys.'

00:04:10.706 --> 00:04:11.206
Right?

00:04:14.507 --> 00:04:16.107
Yu, are the markers set?

00:04:16.506 --> 00:04:17.006
All set.

00:04:17.006 --> 00:04:18.266
Help me steady this stake.

00:04:18.787 --> 00:04:19.907
- Okay.
- It isn't stable.

00:04:20.667 --> 00:04:21.667
Coming.

00:04:23.066 --> 00:04:23.566
Seriously,

00:04:24.306 --> 00:04:24.806
leader,

00:04:25.707 --> 00:04:28.467
don't we have theodolites
or rangefinders?

00:04:29.752 --> 00:04:31.096
(Deep ranging)
No budget for those.

00:04:31.096 --> 00:04:32.547
I'm doing fieldwork with you.

00:04:32.826 --> 00:04:33.626
We're short-staffed.

00:04:33.866 --> 00:04:35.587
This will take forever.

00:04:35.987 --> 00:04:36.907
Less talking.

00:04:36.907 --> 00:04:37.626
Hold it steady.

00:04:38.207 --> 00:04:39.746
We need to finish before dark.

00:04:40.186 --> 00:04:41.407
Got it.

00:04:42.107 --> 00:04:42.607
Come on.

00:04:43.987 --> 00:04:44.506
Hold it.

00:04:44.587 --> 00:04:45.087
Holding.

00:04:47.347 --> 00:04:49.977
I wonder if Mr. Zheng and Xie
can get the loan

00:04:50.104 --> 00:04:51.027
from the credit union.

00:05:51.946 --> 00:05:54.626
So all 300,000 went to roads?

00:05:55.386 --> 00:05:59.147
And you plan to repay it
with money from the 'monkeys'?

00:05:59.587 --> 00:06:00.107
Of course.

00:06:01.066 --> 00:06:02.787
That's the optimal outcome.

00:06:03.306 --> 00:06:05.147
So you've traded land for cash?

00:06:06.787 --> 00:06:07.547
What are you doing?

00:06:12.907 --> 00:06:13.547
Is lunch

00:06:14.626 --> 00:06:15.547
happening today?

00:06:18.587 --> 00:06:19.987
It's about time.

00:06:21.787 --> 00:06:22.287
Lunch.

00:06:24.467 --> 00:06:25.886
Nobody move. No one eats.

00:06:26.506 --> 00:06:27.107
Nobody move.

00:06:29.186 --> 00:06:29.987
Lunch is a must.

00:06:30.227 --> 00:06:32.707
We can skip it, but Lin must eat.

00:06:32.946 --> 00:06:34.744
His low blood sugar can't handle it.

00:06:35.287 --> 00:06:36.946
My job is ensuring nobody moves.

00:06:37.907 --> 00:06:38.626
Nobody move.

00:06:39.547 --> 00:06:40.107
Chief Tian,

00:06:40.426 --> 00:06:43.027
if it complies with regulations,
let him eat first.

00:06:43.667 --> 00:06:44.167
Well,

00:06:45.667 --> 00:06:46.506
it does comply.

00:06:47.347 --> 00:06:48.347
Alright then, Li.

00:06:48.707 --> 00:06:49.987
He can eat alone first.

00:06:50.107 --> 00:06:50.667
Alright?

00:06:50.707 --> 00:06:51.467
Okay.

00:06:52.066 --> 00:06:53.587
Alright, you eat first then.

00:06:53.907 --> 00:06:54.626
But don't leave.

00:07:07.907 --> 00:07:09.907
You haven't answered
my question, Mr. Zheng.

00:07:10.707 --> 00:07:12.027
If not land for money,

00:07:12.506 --> 00:07:13.347
then what for?

00:07:17.266 --> 00:07:19.066
(Free Clinics for All)
Someone asked just now.

00:07:19.746 --> 00:07:21.946
(Making the New City Healthy)
If we build our own houses,

00:07:22.147 --> 00:07:23.787
(Yuehai Plan)
4,000 or 5,000 yuan is enough.

00:07:24.227 --> 00:07:25.667
Why pay extra?

00:07:26.347 --> 00:07:27.987
But have you considered this?

00:07:28.386 --> 00:07:29.667
If you build that house,

00:07:29.707 --> 00:07:31.306
it's just a house.

00:07:31.707 --> 00:07:33.506
There is nothing around it.

00:07:33.907 --> 00:07:34.746
Is there a hospital?

00:07:35.147 --> 00:07:36.107
- No.
- No.

00:07:36.227 --> 00:07:37.306
Is there a school?

00:07:37.547 --> 00:07:38.467
No.

00:07:38.626 --> 00:07:40.587
Most importantly, are there roads?

00:07:41.186 --> 00:07:42.027
- No.
- No.

00:07:42.266 --> 00:07:44.866
Our town government
will handle all these things.

00:07:45.227 --> 00:07:47.866
We promise
to build them properly and beautifully.

00:07:48.066 --> 00:07:50.467
Then everyone's property value
will increase.

00:07:50.626 --> 00:07:51.946
It'll become valuable, right?

00:07:52.266 --> 00:07:53.066
What's the value?

00:07:53.066 --> 00:07:54.227
Really?

00:07:55.066 --> 00:07:55.987
It's a scam, isn't it?

00:07:55.987 --> 00:07:56.787
Really?

00:07:56.787 --> 00:07:58.066
Everyone, quiet down.

00:07:58.227 --> 00:07:58.727
Come on.

00:08:01.587 --> 00:08:03.426
Look what I'm holding.

00:08:03.907 --> 00:08:05.066
Our town government

00:08:05.426 --> 00:08:06.907
created this for all of you.

00:08:07.147 --> 00:08:09.112
(Land Use Certificate)
a temporary land use certificate.

00:08:09.112 --> 00:08:10.264
It's stamped.

00:08:10.426 --> 00:08:12.266
After everyone pays,

00:08:12.707 --> 00:08:15.266
we'll go to the county and exchange them

00:08:15.547 --> 00:08:18.707
for nationally recognized
land use certificates.

Great. Stop.

00:08:51.427 --> 00:08:51.947
Stop.

00:08:54.026 --> 00:08:55.107
Stop. Okay, take a break.

00:08:55.266 --> 00:08:56.707
Take a break. Have some water.

00:08:57.947 --> 00:08:59.386
Alright.

00:09:00.107 --> 00:09:01.026
Alright.

00:09:01.146 --> 00:09:01.746
It's good.

00:09:02.827 --> 00:09:04.146
It's good, right?

00:09:04.386 --> 00:09:04.906
Well,

00:09:05.227 --> 00:09:07.266
by gathering you all at this place,

00:09:07.467 --> 00:09:08.307
I want to tell you

00:09:08.746 --> 00:09:11.506
the Yuehai city construction

00:09:11.827 --> 00:09:13.067
will be the real good show.

00:09:13.587 --> 00:09:14.506
Just wait and see.

00:09:14.746 --> 00:09:17.766
Since we're all gathered here today,

00:09:17.807 --> 00:09:19.386
as the deputy mayor,

00:09:19.587 --> 00:09:20.666
I'd like to invite you all

00:09:21.067 --> 00:09:22.746
to go into the city together. Okay?

00:09:23.187 --> 00:09:24.026
We want the show.

00:09:24.026 --> 00:09:24.947
Get down now.

00:09:25.347 --> 00:09:27.347
- Hurry down. Get down.
- Get down.

00:09:27.347 --> 00:09:27.866
Okay.

00:09:28.146 --> 00:09:29.666
Right, let's watch the show.

00:09:29.906 --> 00:09:30.427
The show.

00:09:31.187 --> 00:09:31.827
The show.

00:09:32.487 --> 00:09:32.987
The show.

00:09:32.987 --> 00:09:34.227
You want the show, don't you?

00:09:34.546 --> 00:09:35.046
Alright.

00:09:35.227 --> 00:09:36.626
Come on. Watch the show.

00:09:36.626 --> 00:09:37.347
Get down.

00:09:39.146 --> 00:09:39.786
Is it good?

00:09:39.947 --> 00:09:41.626
If it's good, sign up quickly.

00:09:41.947 --> 00:09:43.906
We were clear in our publicity.

00:09:44.786 --> 00:09:45.987
This is a construction fee.

00:09:46.666 --> 00:09:48.187
For Yuehai's entire development.

00:09:49.067 --> 00:09:50.746
As for usage details,

00:09:51.626 --> 00:09:53.107
we're completely transparent.

00:09:53.587 --> 00:09:54.666
I get it, Mr. Zheng.

00:09:55.107 --> 00:09:55.987
But frankly speaking,

00:09:56.307 --> 00:09:58.187
you're using city construction
as an excuse

00:09:58.386 --> 00:10:01.427
to collect an extra
'city construction fee.'

00:10:02.187 --> 00:10:03.546
That's twisting definitions.

00:10:04.506 --> 00:10:06.107
How am I twisting definitions?

00:10:06.347 --> 00:10:07.746
We have theoretical backing.

00:10:07.746 --> 00:10:08.347
Sit down.

00:10:09.386 --> 00:10:10.467
I can slam tables too.

00:10:10.707 --> 00:10:12.427
What's your theoretical backing?
Explain.

00:10:16.506 --> 00:10:18.026
I won't explain to you.

00:10:18.746 --> 00:10:20.967
I'll talk to someone reasonable.

00:10:21.626 --> 00:10:22.427
Zheng Decheng, stop.

00:10:23.416 --> 00:10:26.187
Xie, give me the motorcycle keys.
I'm going to the county committee.

00:10:26.187 --> 00:10:26.827
Mr. Zheng.

00:10:27.026 --> 00:10:27.546
What's up?

00:10:27.827 --> 00:10:28.546
The talk failed?

00:10:28.546 --> 00:10:29.227
Zheng Decheng...

00:10:29.266 --> 00:10:30.386
Hold the fort. Wait for me.

00:10:30.707 --> 00:10:31.546
What's this about?

00:10:31.546 --> 00:10:32.427
Tian, watch them.

00:10:32.427 --> 00:10:33.976
Said he'll visit the county committee.

00:10:33.976 --> 00:10:35.160
To see the leadership

00:10:35.160 --> 00:10:36.227
(Yuehai Town People's Government)
and report things.

00:10:36.227 --> 00:10:36.760
Right?

00:10:41.707 --> 00:10:42.488
What are you doing?

00:10:42.488 --> 00:10:44.344
Returning to the county to report work.

00:10:46.987 --> 00:10:49.546
Li, men and women
shouldn't be overly familiar.

00:10:49.752 --> 00:10:52.166
It's not appropriate for you
to ride on my motorcycle, okay?

00:10:52.546 --> 00:10:53.666
I know it's not appropriate.

00:10:53.866 --> 00:10:54.827
But I have no choice.

00:10:55.266 --> 00:10:56.706
They didn't assign us a vehicle.

00:10:56.706 --> 00:10:57.707
Mr. Zhao instructed us

00:10:57.707 --> 00:11:00.347
to return to the county
to report before sunset.

00:11:00.746 --> 00:11:02.067
So, let's go, Mr. Zheng.

00:11:04.427 --> 00:11:06.207
Then what about Mr. Cai
and the other one?

00:11:06.546 --> 00:11:07.896
They'll figure it out themselves.

00:11:11.786 --> 00:11:12.286
Fine.

00:11:12.827 --> 00:11:14.187
But let me be blunt upfront.

00:11:14.626 --> 00:11:17.146
If anything happens,
I won't take responsibility.

00:11:18.746 --> 00:11:20.866
You actually need
to be responsible for my safety.

00:11:26.948 --> 00:11:28.268
(Yuehai Town People's Government)

00:11:28.268 --> 00:11:29.528
(The CPC Yuehai Town Committee)

00:11:37.227 --> 00:11:38.026
Li,

00:11:38.347 --> 00:11:40.347
is it because you
lost the competition to me

00:11:40.786 --> 00:11:41.987
that you resent me a bit?

00:11:43.906 --> 00:11:46.427
Zheng, saying that makes you petty.

00:11:46.987 --> 00:11:48.866
I'm only concerned
about the people of Yuehai.

00:11:49.307 --> 00:11:50.746
Afraid you'll burden them.

00:11:52.987 --> 00:11:53.947
Burden them how?

00:11:54.386 --> 00:11:55.427
I've told you already.

00:11:55.786 --> 00:11:56.827
We didn't sell any land.

00:12:06.467 --> 00:12:07.026
Mr. Zheng.

00:12:09.427 --> 00:12:09.947
Mr. Zheng.

00:12:10.146 --> 00:12:11.146
Eat something, alright?

00:12:13.707 --> 00:12:15.546
What exactly are you looking for?

00:12:15.626 --> 00:12:16.587
Theoretical backing.

00:12:18.386 --> 00:12:19.067
To sell land?

00:12:19.427 --> 00:12:20.626
No. It's illegal.

00:12:20.866 --> 00:12:21.626
We can't do that.

00:12:21.626 --> 00:12:23.347
Really, Mr. Zheng. We absolutely can't.

00:12:24.827 --> 00:12:25.386
Tan.

00:12:26.266 --> 00:12:28.467
I would never do anything illegal.

00:12:29.546 --> 00:12:30.046
Okay.

00:12:30.107 --> 00:12:31.427
When I first formed the team,

00:12:31.467 --> 00:12:31.967
I hired you

00:12:31.987 --> 00:12:33.307
precisely to rein me in a bit.

00:12:33.546 --> 00:12:34.546
Right.

00:12:34.707 --> 00:12:35.786
I am reining you in.

00:12:35.866 --> 00:12:37.528
Listen to my advice.

00:12:37.528 --> 00:12:38.616
We absolutely can't do that

00:12:39.067 --> 00:12:39.906
or think about it.

00:12:40.187 --> 00:12:41.506
How am I not listening to you?

00:12:42.266 --> 00:12:42.766
Alright.

00:12:43.546 --> 00:12:44.707
Come up with an idea for me.

00:12:45.026 --> 00:12:46.427
How can we collect money

00:12:46.947 --> 00:12:49.026
and allocate land
to the 'monkeys' to build houses

00:12:49.546 --> 00:12:51.227
without violating the Constitution?

00:12:51.786 --> 00:12:52.286
Tell me.

00:12:54.786 --> 00:12:56.107
Then... Then how about...

00:12:56.107 --> 00:12:56.607
I...

00:12:57.666 --> 00:12:59.626
I'll join you
in finding the theoretical backing.

00:13:00.146 --> 00:13:00.646
Come on.

00:13:01.587 --> 00:13:02.467
(The Story of Hardoon)
Have you read this book?

00:13:03.506 --> 00:13:04.006
No.

00:13:05.626 --> 00:13:06.707
Hardoon said...

00:13:06.866 --> 00:13:08.587
The very Hardoon here.

00:13:09.067 --> 00:13:10.666
He said, after buying land,

00:13:11.146 --> 00:13:12.467
his first choice

00:13:12.467 --> 00:13:14.266
was to lease the entire land to others.

00:13:14.786 --> 00:13:16.187
He not only collected rent,

00:13:16.307 --> 00:13:18.866
but also, after the contract expired,

00:13:19.128 --> 00:13:21.400
he could reclaim both the land
and the buildings on it.

00:13:21.906 --> 00:13:22.947
What does that mean?

00:13:23.026 --> 00:13:23.736
Wait, Mr. Zheng.

00:13:23.736 --> 00:13:25.107
What that means doesn't matter.

00:13:25.546 --> 00:13:26.427
How could we

00:13:26.506 --> 00:13:28.347
possibly follow what Hardoon did?

00:13:28.546 --> 00:13:29.506
We're in a new era now.

00:13:29.646 --> 00:13:30.146
Well,

00:13:30.146 --> 00:13:32.067
the theory in this book
absolutely won't do.

00:13:32.307 --> 00:13:32.947
Drop the idea.

00:13:33.026 --> 00:13:34.386
Let's look in another book.

00:13:34.746 --> 00:13:36.026
As useful as saying nothing.

00:13:36.906 --> 00:13:39.386
But you haven't found
the theoretical backing.

00:13:40.146 --> 00:13:41.307
It's not that easy.

00:13:43.386 --> 00:13:45.467
So isn't this
still circumventing the Constitution?

00:13:45.666 --> 00:13:46.827
Think whatever you want.

00:13:47.347 --> 00:13:49.016
I know the Constitution better.

00:13:52.827 --> 00:13:55.427
Article 10 of the Constitution
of the People's Republic of China.

00:13:55.427 --> 00:13:57.146
Land in the cities
is owned by the state.

00:13:57.467 --> 00:13:59.307
The state holds ownership of the land

00:13:59.427 --> 00:14:00.707
and has the right to manage

00:14:00.707 --> 00:14:02.168
and utilize it according to law.

00:14:02.168 --> 00:14:03.480
No organization or individual

00:14:03.480 --> 00:14:04.947
may appropriate, buy, sell,

00:14:05.307 --> 00:14:07.866
or otherwise transfer land
by unlawful means.

00:14:17.587 --> 00:14:18.187
Zheng Decheng,

00:14:19.704 --> 00:14:21.080
you've memorized the Constitution?

00:14:21.304 --> 00:14:23.256
You're like someone
from Journey to the West.

00:14:23.626 --> 00:14:24.187
Sun Wukong.

00:14:24.626 --> 00:14:26.264
I sent you to Yuehai to build a city,

00:14:26.264 --> 00:14:28.707
not to turn it into a lawless place.

00:14:29.107 --> 00:14:30.307
Do you take us for fools

00:14:30.347 --> 00:14:31.546
from the county committee?

00:14:31.827 --> 00:14:32.587
See for yourself.

00:14:33.146 --> 00:14:35.347
Anyone can see you're inventing excuses.

00:14:36.026 --> 00:14:36.526
Look.

00:14:36.746 --> 00:14:38.386
Mr. Zhao, your misunderstanding

00:14:38.506 --> 00:14:39.587
is huge.

00:14:40.067 --> 00:14:40.567
I...

00:14:40.786 --> 00:14:42.866
How could you possibly look like a fool?

00:14:43.187 --> 00:14:44.386
You're a man of great wisdom.

00:14:44.906 --> 00:14:46.146
Even if I were Sun Wukong,

00:14:46.187 --> 00:14:48.026
I couldn't escape your grasp, could I?

00:14:48.666 --> 00:14:49.347
I admit it.

00:14:49.866 --> 00:14:51.266
This matter does look

00:14:51.587 --> 00:14:52.947
somewhat like land trading.

00:14:53.427 --> 00:14:54.827
But there's a key difference.

00:14:55.347 --> 00:14:57.427
It's based on my rigorous research.

00:14:59.626 --> 00:15:00.626
What rigorous research?

00:15:10.987 --> 00:15:11.587
Tan.

00:15:13.227 --> 00:15:14.266
I thought of another term.

00:15:14.746 --> 00:15:15.347
Listen.

00:15:17.666 --> 00:15:19.307
Land transfer fee.

00:15:21.746 --> 00:15:23.506
Land transfer fee?

00:15:23.666 --> 00:15:24.166
How is it?

00:15:24.987 --> 00:15:25.506
No.

00:15:25.746 --> 00:15:26.666
Absolutely not.

00:15:26.666 --> 00:15:27.746
This won't do.

00:15:27.987 --> 00:15:30.227
Nothing ever seems to be allowed.

00:15:30.546 --> 00:15:31.786
You just keep discouraging me.

00:15:32.146 --> 00:15:32.906
You think of one.

00:15:35.307 --> 00:15:37.386
I can't think of anything right now.

00:15:38.026 --> 00:15:40.146
But Mr. Zheng,
I'm reading this book set now.

00:15:40.146 --> 00:15:41.227
There must be an answer.

00:15:46.482 --> 00:15:47.608
(Das Kapital, Marx)

00:15:53.427 --> 00:15:54.307
Das Kapital?

00:15:59.347 --> 00:16:00.107
Das Kapital?

00:16:01.587 --> 00:16:02.087
Yes.

00:16:02.712 --> 00:16:04.824
Why did I think of
the city construction fee?

00:16:04.824 --> 00:16:06.187
It came from Das Kapital.

00:16:06.587 --> 00:16:08.626
Das Kapital
provides the theoretical backing.

00:16:10.187 --> 00:16:11.947
There's one thing I don't understand.

00:16:12.307 --> 00:16:15.026
Which volume of Das Kapital
provided the theoretical backing?

00:16:16.666 --> 00:16:18.666
How could I remember that?

00:16:18.666 --> 00:16:19.352
Too many volumes.

00:16:19.987 --> 00:16:20.587
But it's there.

00:16:21.266 --> 00:16:21.786
Really.

00:16:23.266 --> 00:16:24.906
There are three volumes in Das Kapital.

00:16:25.227 --> 00:16:27.626
Volume one examines
the production process of capital.

00:16:27.707 --> 00:16:30.026
Volume two studies
the circulation process of capital.

00:16:30.427 --> 00:16:33.626
Volume three describes
capitalist production's overall process.

00:16:33.906 --> 00:16:34.546
Mr. Zheng,

00:16:35.067 --> 00:16:37.227
which volume
does your theoretical backing come from?

00:16:37.546 --> 00:16:38.427
Have you decided?

00:16:46.827 --> 00:16:47.626
Yes.

00:16:48.467 --> 00:16:51.146
At first, it did come from Das Kapital.

00:16:51.506 --> 00:16:53.827
But upon closer examination,
it didn't hold up.

00:16:54.107 --> 00:16:55.146
So actually, Das Kapital

00:16:55.386 --> 00:16:57.187
didn't solve the final problem for me.

00:16:59.786 --> 00:17:01.187
Then how was it solved in the end?

00:17:15.187 --> 00:17:18.147
Attention, residents!

00:17:18.346 --> 00:17:21.947
We're about to witness
the founding of Yuehai City.

00:17:22.387 --> 00:17:23.026
Yuehai,

00:17:23.387 --> 00:17:27.026
a land that carries
both nature and civilization,

00:17:27.387 --> 00:17:29.627
will soon be revitalized.

00:17:29.907 --> 00:17:34.227
We must work together to build Yuehai.

00:17:34.467 --> 00:17:36.867
Build!

00:17:41.947 --> 00:17:42.746
Don't rush.

00:17:43.546 --> 00:17:44.467
No problem.

00:17:44.826 --> 00:17:47.106
Some difficulties are perfectly normal.

00:17:48.106 --> 00:17:51.266
Attention, residents!

00:17:51.387 --> 00:17:55.147
We're about to witness
the founding of Yuehai City.

00:17:55.427 --> 00:17:56.346
It's too noisy.

00:17:56.746 --> 00:17:59.867
A land that carries
both nature and civilization...

00:17:59.867 --> 00:18:02.227
- Turn it down.
- Mr. Zheng is angry.

00:18:02.667 --> 00:18:03.826
Turn it down.

00:18:03.867 --> 00:18:04.786
I want him to listen.

00:18:04.786 --> 00:18:07.586
Work together to build Yuehai.

00:18:07.746 --> 00:18:11.187
Build!

00:18:24.306 --> 00:18:25.306
Who was on the broadcast?

00:18:26.387 --> 00:18:27.147
Who was it?

00:18:27.187 --> 00:18:28.106
Mr. Zheng.

00:18:28.106 --> 00:18:28.606
Not me.

00:18:28.867 --> 00:18:30.066
I know it was your voice.

00:18:30.147 --> 00:18:31.346
He was just doing his job.

00:18:31.346 --> 00:18:32.707
What did you say?

00:18:32.867 --> 00:18:33.506
Work together.

00:18:33.586 --> 00:18:34.387
Be quiet.

00:18:34.546 --> 00:18:35.187
Not that part.

00:18:35.224 --> 00:18:35.907
Something else.

00:18:35.907 --> 00:18:36.947
Build Yuehai.

00:18:37.026 --> 00:18:38.746
Just be quiet. Alright?

00:18:42.106 --> 00:18:42.627
Mr. Zheng.

00:18:44.026 --> 00:18:44.947
You've figured it out?

00:18:45.867 --> 00:18:46.947
Have you figured it out?

00:18:49.306 --> 00:18:49.987
Great.

00:18:52.427 --> 00:18:53.147
Great.

00:18:55.266 --> 00:18:56.707
Great. You've figured it out.

00:18:56.947 --> 00:18:57.506
Great.

00:19:01.546 --> 00:19:02.947
Great.

00:19:07.066 --> 00:19:08.746
So that's how you came up

00:19:08.867 --> 00:19:10.266
(Secretary's Office)
with the city construction fee?

00:19:10.627 --> 00:19:12.066
Yes. Mr. Zhao,

00:19:13.586 --> 00:19:14.506
the state has no money.

00:19:14.987 --> 00:19:17.506
It's the biggest challenge we face
in Yuehai's development.

00:19:17.987 --> 00:19:20.306
That's why
I proposed the 'city construction fee.'

00:19:20.627 --> 00:19:21.947
I believe with this fee in place,

00:19:22.266 --> 00:19:23.506
we can start building Yuehai.

00:19:25.546 --> 00:19:27.387
So the people were willing to pay?

00:19:27.667 --> 00:19:28.947
It's not that simple.

00:19:30.467 --> 00:19:34.346
Yuehai Town Master Plan.

00:19:34.826 --> 00:19:38.546
This is the blueprint

00:19:38.546 --> 00:19:39.867
(Yuehai Town Master Plan)
for our prosperous future life.

00:19:40.266 --> 00:19:40.766
Right.

00:19:41.346 --> 00:19:43.427
At first glance,
it seems to have everything.

00:19:44.106 --> 00:19:45.026
Wait a minute.

00:19:45.427 --> 00:19:46.667
We must be in the wrong place.

00:19:46.786 --> 00:19:47.506
Something's wrong.

00:19:47.627 --> 00:19:48.227
It can't be it.

00:19:48.667 --> 00:19:49.546
We're not lost.

00:19:50.106 --> 00:19:50.907
Look carefully.

00:19:51.746 --> 00:19:52.427
This is the spot.

00:19:53.227 --> 00:19:53.727
See?

00:20:02.627 --> 00:20:03.127
But...

00:20:03.306 --> 00:20:04.586
T-This is a reed marsh.

00:20:04.586 --> 00:20:05.528
To build houses here?

00:20:05.528 --> 00:20:07.000
What's wrong with a reed marsh?

00:20:07.346 --> 00:20:09.227
It just means
more initial construction work.

00:20:09.387 --> 00:20:10.907
It'll be done with some money.

00:20:11.306 --> 00:20:12.106
But... Well...

00:20:12.786 --> 00:20:14.586
How can we build on a marsh?

00:20:14.667 --> 00:20:15.746
Of course, we can.

00:20:16.187 --> 00:20:17.387
We can build on a marsh.

00:20:18.306 --> 00:20:20.066
I think we should pick somewhere else.

00:20:21.346 --> 00:20:22.947
Changyuan, I need to go. Bye.

00:20:23.218 --> 00:20:25.094
(Pay Here)

00:20:39.346 --> 00:20:45.136
(Pay Here)

00:20:48.370 --> 00:20:51.641
(Consult Here)

00:20:54.106 --> 00:20:55.066
Coming through.

00:20:56.227 --> 00:20:57.786
Stop pushing.

00:20:57.826 --> 00:20:58.326
Excuse me.

00:20:58.627 --> 00:21:00.106
Can we choose our own plot?

00:21:00.586 --> 00:21:02.026
Probably not.

00:21:02.387 --> 00:21:03.867
To ensure fairness,

00:21:04.026 --> 00:21:06.227
we'll decide by lottery.

00:21:06.467 --> 00:21:08.306
Okay? Any other questions?

00:21:11.947 --> 00:21:12.667
Rest assured.

00:21:12.786 --> 00:21:15.026
Yuehai offers the best conditions.

00:21:15.826 --> 00:21:17.066
After you pay, the money

00:21:17.586 --> 00:21:18.907
will go to Yuehai's construction.

00:21:19.066 --> 00:21:20.987
So Yuehai will keep getting better,

00:21:21.106 --> 00:21:21.987
with more residents.

00:21:22.346 --> 00:21:24.707
And Yuehai's future will be very bright.

00:21:25.586 --> 00:21:26.187
So many people?

00:21:28.627 --> 00:21:30.207
How's it going, Mr. Tan?

00:21:30.506 --> 00:21:31.627
Exhausted? So many people.

00:21:34.546 --> 00:21:36.086
Wait, where's the money?

00:21:37.106 --> 00:21:38.907
All these people, and not one paid?

00:21:39.506 --> 00:21:41.026
They're here to consult the Secretary.

00:21:41.346 --> 00:21:43.546
Not a single one comes to pay.

00:21:45.586 --> 00:21:49.066
With such good policies and conditions,

00:21:50.346 --> 00:21:52.786
'monkeys' should be lining up to pay.

00:21:53.667 --> 00:21:55.147
Where's the problem?

00:21:55.667 --> 00:21:57.947
Who'd come for reeds land?

00:22:01.746 --> 00:22:02.306
Nothing.

00:22:06.066 --> 00:22:08.106
Your Xuemei said
to lead by example and pay.

00:22:08.627 --> 00:22:09.400
Where is she?

00:22:09.400 --> 00:22:10.136
- Yeah.
- Right.

00:22:10.867 --> 00:22:11.467
What?

00:22:11.546 --> 00:22:12.667
Stop it. Did she pay?

00:22:12.907 --> 00:22:13.467
Not yet?

00:22:13.786 --> 00:22:14.826
Doesn't she listen to you?

00:22:15.147 --> 00:22:15.867
Of course.

00:22:16.187 --> 00:22:17.187
I told her several times,

00:22:17.467 --> 00:22:18.786
"Hurry up and pay!"

00:22:19.106 --> 00:22:21.387
She insisted on earning
a few more days of bank interest.

00:22:21.667 --> 00:22:23.147
Just for few bank interest?

00:22:23.387 --> 00:22:25.187
How much interest
could that possibly be?

00:22:29.867 --> 00:22:31.266
Seems we need to give them a push.

00:22:32.667 --> 00:22:33.346
How?

00:22:33.627 --> 00:22:34.127
Quiet!

00:22:35.746 --> 00:22:36.427
He is thinking.

00:22:43.746 --> 00:22:45.227
Set a deadline.

00:22:45.987 --> 00:22:47.427
No payments accepted after that.

00:22:48.106 --> 00:22:50.667
Go and tell those
who are interested in joining,

00:22:51.227 --> 00:22:51.907
"Now or never."

00:22:57.147 --> 00:22:58.627
So did anyone pay in the end?

00:22:58.947 --> 00:23:01.627
Li, don't rush.

00:23:11.058 --> 00:23:15.314

Closes at 6 PM today)

Secretary, your idea might not work.

00:24:00.306 --> 00:24:00.806
Right?

00:24:01.066 --> 00:24:02.826
Look at the time. It's almost dark.

00:24:03.266 --> 00:24:04.427
The credit union is closing.

00:24:06.467 --> 00:24:06.967
I'm hungry.

00:24:14.867 --> 00:24:15.367
Go back.

00:24:19.826 --> 00:24:20.627
Serve the dinner.

00:24:21.467 --> 00:24:24.106

00:27:15.387 --> 00:27:16.106
Okay, Secretary.

(After hearing Zheng Decheng's words,)

00:27:19.128 --> 00:27:21.066

(to build the city
for the people and by the people.)

00:27:29.368 --> 00:27:31.468
(We are at the forefront
of Reform and Opening-up.)

00:27:31.707 --> 00:27:32.867
(If what we want to do)

00:27:32.867 --> 00:27:34.826
(benefits the people

00:27:35.346 --> 00:27:36.667
(then practicing before theory)

00:27:37.147 --> 00:27:39.227
(can also be a valuable attempt.)

00:27:39.746 --> 00:27:40.266
(Secretary's Office)
Li, here.

00:27:40.266 --> 00:27:40.947
Good stuff.

00:27:45.066 --> 00:27:47.306
Zheng Decheng, I didn't expect

00:27:47.306 --> 00:27:49.176
you went through a lot
before opening the city.

00:27:49.826 --> 00:27:52.106
You're clever and bold.

00:27:53.867 --> 00:27:55.467
But you must understand

00:27:56.026 --> 00:27:57.707
this matter carries real risks.

00:28:09.786 --> 00:28:10.346
Secretary,

00:28:11.746 --> 00:28:13.467
having worked
at the grassroots for years,

00:28:14.106 --> 00:28:16.026
I know what can and can't be done.

00:28:16.627 --> 00:28:18.867
I specifically studied
the Constitution for this,

00:28:19.187 --> 00:28:21.026
especially the articles concerning land.

00:28:21.346 --> 00:28:23.387
What is the core principle
of our Land Law?

00:28:24.106 --> 00:28:27.667
I believe it's state ownership of land
and private ownership is prohibited.

00:28:28.266 --> 00:28:30.586
So, as long as
we don't violate this core principle,

00:28:30.987 --> 00:28:32.826
and the land remains state-owned,

00:28:33.306 --> 00:28:35.546
whether we collect
city construction fees

00:28:35.947 --> 00:28:37.187
or issue land use certificates,

00:28:37.546 --> 00:28:38.746
we aren't breaking the law.

00:28:41.907 --> 00:28:42.546
Go on.

00:28:44.147 --> 00:28:44.826
Get numb legs?

00:28:46.627 --> 00:28:47.147
Secretary.

00:28:48.586 --> 00:28:49.586
No matter what,

00:28:49.987 --> 00:28:51.106
you must support us.

00:28:51.746 --> 00:28:52.627
If you refuse,

00:28:53.147 --> 00:28:55.427
even if I had superpower,

00:28:56.106 --> 00:28:57.746
I still couldn't accomplish my task.

00:28:58.187 --> 00:28:59.506
If someone offers a better idea,

00:28:59.867 --> 00:29:01.106
I'll step aside immediately.

00:29:02.866 --> 00:29:03.827
(Secretary's Office)

00:29:05.867 --> 00:29:07.546
Zheng Decheng, and you, Li.

00:29:07.667 --> 00:29:08.266
With you here,

00:29:08.546 --> 00:29:10.266
I'll say this behind closed doors.

00:29:10.907 --> 00:29:13.987
Like you, I've been constantly thinking
about the funding issue.

00:29:14.826 --> 00:29:15.707
But I didn't think of

00:29:15.786 --> 00:29:17.266
charging city construction fee

00:29:18.066 --> 00:29:19.947
or issuing land use certificates.

00:29:20.506 --> 00:29:21.306
Your idea

00:29:21.427 --> 00:29:24.106
could indeed solve
the city construction funding issue.

00:29:25.707 --> 00:29:26.266
However...

00:29:29.066 --> 00:29:29.566
However...

00:29:30.387 --> 00:29:31.147
And then?

00:29:32.187 --> 00:29:34.427
Whether you can collect
the city construction fee,

00:29:35.550 --> 00:29:36.990
whether you get disciplinary action,

00:29:37.370 --> 00:29:39.350
it depends on
the County Standing Committee.

00:29:42.786 --> 00:29:44.266
D-Disciplinary action?

00:29:45.746 --> 00:29:47.467
A-Alright then.

00:29:47.667 --> 00:29:48.746
Can you speed it up?

00:29:49.187 --> 00:29:50.066
How can I speed it up?

00:29:50.907 --> 00:29:51.826
We need to discuss it

00:29:51.867 --> 00:29:53.506
in the Standing Committee meeting.

00:29:53.546 --> 00:29:55.506
This is a major issue, not a minor one.

00:29:55.947 --> 00:29:56.447
Yes.

00:29:57.467 --> 00:29:57.967
Right.

00:29:58.387 --> 00:29:59.106
I-I understand.

00:29:59.506 --> 00:30:00.746
You need to think carefully,

00:30:01.147 --> 00:30:03.266
only then can you decide.

00:30:03.667 --> 00:30:04.167
Then,

00:30:05.346 --> 00:30:06.627
I'll wait in the courtyard.

00:30:09.387 --> 00:30:10.427
Then I'll go.

00:30:10.907 --> 00:30:12.147
I'll go to the courtyard.

00:30:12.947 --> 00:30:14.147
Go have some water.

00:30:14.147 --> 00:30:14.647
Okay.

00:30:17.546 --> 00:30:18.187
Li, stay.

00:30:20.147 --> 00:30:20.647
Alright.

00:30:22.227 --> 00:30:22.727
Li.

00:30:23.786 --> 00:30:25.987
I'd like to hear your thoughts on this.

00:30:27.786 --> 00:30:31.187
Collecting city construction fee
truly has no precedent.

00:30:31.586 --> 00:30:33.026
Our investigation team believes

00:30:33.427 --> 00:30:37.066
this approach is inconsistent
with the Constitution.

00:30:37.907 --> 00:30:41.147
However, Zheng Decheng
granted city construction fee

00:30:41.306 --> 00:30:42.586
to 1,214 farming households

00:30:42.627 --> 00:30:44.266
with the city construction fee.

00:30:44.786 --> 00:30:48.106
This aligns
with the No. 1 Central Document.

00:30:49.346 --> 00:30:52.467
Yuehai collected
a total of 9.49 million yuan.

00:30:52.707 --> 00:30:54.106
The accounts are in order.

00:30:55.826 --> 00:30:57.586
So, what's your thought on his approach?

00:31:00.106 --> 00:31:01.586
I think his approach

00:31:02.506 --> 00:31:03.546
is quite bold

00:31:04.667 --> 00:31:05.667
and cunning.

00:31:07.106 --> 00:31:08.786
But since he managed
to come up with this,

00:31:09.786 --> 00:31:10.867
he's quite impressive.

00:31:25.490 --> 00:31:26.712
(Forestry Dept)

00:31:33.786 --> 00:31:34.667
You bureaucrat.

00:31:38.026 --> 00:31:38.667
What's wrong?

00:31:39.627 --> 00:31:40.187
Is it gone?

00:31:40.467 --> 00:31:41.147
What's gone?

00:31:41.506 --> 00:31:43.026
They say a fright can stop hiccups.

00:31:44.026 --> 00:31:44.826
It worked.

00:31:50.066 --> 00:31:51.346
She scared me?

00:31:51.907 --> 00:31:53.346
This violates policy.

00:31:53.487 --> 00:31:53.987
Won't work.

00:31:53.987 --> 00:31:54.907
We might get punished.

00:31:54.907 --> 00:31:55.786
He acts recklessly.

00:31:55.907 --> 00:31:57.147
I really think it won't work.

00:31:58.947 --> 00:31:59.506
What is this?

00:31:59.506 --> 00:32:01.506
Can we stop with these fancy ideas?

00:32:01.586 --> 00:32:02.147
Exactly.

00:32:02.346 --> 00:32:04.506
Collecting city construction fee is new,

00:32:04.667 --> 00:32:05.586
but it isn't illegal.

00:32:05.746 --> 00:32:06.546
At least, I found

00:32:06.707 --> 00:32:08.106
no article in law

00:32:08.187 --> 00:32:09.867
that prohibits to it.

00:32:10.147 --> 00:32:13.026
Yuehai collecting city construction fee
is a big deal.

00:32:13.266 --> 00:32:14.826
Honestly, isn't this like selling land?

00:32:15.546 --> 00:32:16.627
Everyone, think about it.

00:32:16.947 --> 00:32:18.026
If people don't pay,

00:32:18.266 --> 00:32:19.467
they won't get the land.

00:32:19.987 --> 00:32:21.306
Getting the land after paying.

00:32:21.586 --> 00:32:22.826
Isn't that just selling land?

00:32:22.987 --> 00:32:24.227
It's just a change in form,

00:32:24.506 --> 00:32:25.266
but not in content.

00:32:25.667 --> 00:32:26.627
I disagree with you.

00:32:26.826 --> 00:32:27.627
Liu is right.

00:32:28.147 --> 00:32:29.667
If higher-ups investigate this,

00:32:30.266 --> 00:32:31.266
we'd take a great risk.

00:32:31.487 --> 00:32:32.546
- Yes.
- Secretary Zhao.

00:32:32.987 --> 00:32:34.106
We can't take this risk.

00:32:34.346 --> 00:32:35.467
I also agree with Liu.

00:32:37.746 --> 00:32:39.187
Xia, speak up.

00:32:43.106 --> 00:32:43.667
I think

00:32:46.106 --> 00:32:47.306
everyone has made a point.

00:32:47.786 --> 00:32:50.546
But regarding this matter,
I still have reservations.

00:32:51.106 --> 00:32:51.707
It's true

00:32:51.826 --> 00:32:54.707
that collecting city construction fee
isn't explicitly illegal,

00:32:55.147 --> 00:32:57.586
but there's no policy backing it.

00:32:57.987 --> 00:32:58.487
Right?

00:32:58.786 --> 00:32:59.826
This is too novel.

00:33:00.867 --> 00:33:01.947
Is our Pingchuan County

00:33:02.746 --> 00:33:04.667
really going to be that adventurous?

00:33:05.400 --> 00:33:06.500
County Magistrate is right.

00:33:07.026 --> 00:33:08.306
We should study it further.

00:33:08.867 --> 00:33:10.586
Secretary Zhao, regarding this...

00:33:12.187 --> 00:33:14.066
Today's meeting is quite productive.

00:33:14.707 --> 00:33:16.427
All of you have spoken your minds

00:33:16.627 --> 00:33:17.506
without holding back.

00:33:18.066 --> 00:33:19.586
Regarding the question Xia raised,

00:33:19.707 --> 00:33:20.746
I've also asked myself.

00:33:21.746 --> 00:33:23.066
Our Pingchuan

00:33:23.427 --> 00:33:24.627
is such a small county.

00:33:25.627 --> 00:33:27.187
Do we need to be the first to try it?

00:33:30.546 --> 00:33:32.066
But building a city from scratch

00:33:32.227 --> 00:33:33.586
is an adventurous thing.

00:33:34.387 --> 00:33:36.667
Building a city without money
is even more like it.

00:33:38.746 --> 00:33:39.246
Okay.

00:33:40.786 --> 00:33:41.586
We need money.

00:33:42.667 --> 00:33:43.627
Zheng Decheng charged

00:33:44.026 --> 00:33:44.907
city construction fee

00:33:45.667 --> 00:33:47.066
and issued land use certificates.

00:33:47.627 --> 00:33:48.546
He solved this problem,

00:33:49.746 --> 00:33:50.667
and it's not illegal.

00:33:51.947 --> 00:33:52.786
Isn't it good?

00:33:53.707 --> 00:33:56.266
Some say this is just
a change in form but not in content.

00:33:56.746 --> 00:33:57.826
It's just selling the land.

00:33:58.387 --> 00:33:59.266
But I don't think so.

00:33:59.667 --> 00:34:02.707
I think he did change the content.

00:34:03.746 --> 00:34:06.467
It is a brand-new concept.

00:34:10.987 --> 00:34:11.867
Just earlier,

00:34:11.987 --> 00:34:13.586
before the meeting started,

00:34:14.626 --> 00:34:16.066
I had a conversation

00:34:16.747 --> 00:34:18.186
with Zheng Decheng.

00:34:20.506 --> 00:34:22.427
He said to me,

00:34:23.026 --> 00:34:23.747
"Secretary,

00:34:24.747 --> 00:34:26.546
I just want to use

00:34:26.968 --> 00:34:28.984
the funds from Pingchuan's
six thousand 'monkeys'

00:34:29.387 --> 00:34:31.307
to build a prosperous city

00:34:31.666 --> 00:34:34.146
that can rank among the top in China."

00:34:34.586 --> 00:34:35.987
"My dream is

00:34:36.586 --> 00:34:38.907
to multiply Pingchuan's economy
several times over."

00:34:39.347 --> 00:34:41.546
This Zheng Decheng is no ordinary man.

00:34:41.626 --> 00:34:42.867
In my conversation with him,

00:34:43.347 --> 00:34:45.050
I was greatly inspired and enlightened.

00:34:45.050 --> 00:34:46.666
So, as the Secretary
of county committee,

00:34:46.666 --> 00:34:47.947
I fully support him.

00:34:48.226 --> 00:34:50.427
I support Yuehai collecting
the city construction fee.

00:34:58.987 --> 00:35:01.146
Secretary Zhao, shall we
stick to the usual procedure?

00:35:01.307 --> 00:35:01.907
Let's vote.

00:35:02.066 --> 00:35:02.566
Okay.

00:35:04.267 --> 00:35:05.307
Secretary Zhao.

00:35:06.146 --> 00:35:06.827
I abstain.

00:35:07.666 --> 00:35:08.186
Okay.

00:35:09.026 --> 00:35:09.706
Me too.

00:35:13.867 --> 00:35:15.307
Any other abstaining?

00:35:18.987 --> 00:35:20.506
If not, we'll vote by a show of hands.

00:35:22.296 --> 00:35:24.952
Those in favor of Yuehai collecting
the city construction fee,

00:35:25.336 --> 00:35:26.072
raise your hands.

00:35:43.826 --> 00:35:46.648
Five votes in favor,
two against, two abstentions.

00:35:47.320 --> 00:35:48.347
The resolution on

00:35:48.664 --> 00:35:51.747
collecting city construction fee
in Yuehai has been officially approved.

00:36:07.730 --> 00:36:10.354
(Beyond the Horizon)

00:36:38.186 --> 00:36:40.626
When can I leave this place?

00:37:04.026 --> 00:37:04.666
You play well.

00:37:06.307 --> 00:37:06.807
Secretary.

00:37:07.146 --> 00:37:09.427
(Ignore me)
Don't wear this to work.

00:37:10.626 --> 00:37:11.586
But today...

00:37:13.320 --> 00:37:14.120
(Ignore me)
I'm off.

00:37:15.427 --> 00:37:17.307
Please make an exception
and take the money.

00:37:17.387 --> 00:37:18.267
D-Don't give it to me.

00:37:18.267 --> 00:37:18.987
Exception? I...

00:37:19.224 --> 00:37:20.184
The deadline's due.

00:37:20.267 --> 00:37:21.267
I can't take it.

00:37:21.907 --> 00:37:23.387
I finally raised this money.

00:37:23.427 --> 00:37:23.987
Why don't you

00:37:23.987 --> 00:37:24.827
- take it?
- You said...

00:37:24.827 --> 00:37:26.106
Who said you can't pay?

00:37:26.907 --> 00:37:27.586
M-Mr. Zheng.

00:37:27.626 --> 00:37:28.706
- Secretary.
- Secretary.

00:37:29.586 --> 00:37:30.106
Back off.

00:37:30.706 --> 00:37:32.146
Secretary is here. Listen to him.

00:37:32.566 --> 00:37:33.066
Secretary.

00:37:33.066 --> 00:37:33.907
Is it really okay?

00:37:34.427 --> 00:37:34.927
Take it.

00:37:35.347 --> 00:37:38.267
What do you mean?
The deadline has passed.

00:37:38.626 --> 00:37:39.347
Exactly.

00:37:39.947 --> 00:37:41.026
The first phase has closed.

00:37:41.586 --> 00:37:43.146
We have the second and third phases.

00:37:43.787 --> 00:37:46.427
We must view this matter
with a development perspective.

00:37:46.827 --> 00:37:48.267
Yuehai will only get better,

00:37:48.626 --> 00:37:50.626
and the construction fee
will only get higher.

00:37:50.987 --> 00:37:53.066
Paying now is still
at the cheapest price.

00:37:53.186 --> 00:37:54.586
Right, we'll pay now.

00:37:54.666 --> 00:37:55.626
- We pay now.
- Pay now.

00:37:55.867 --> 00:37:57.226
It's not appropriate.

00:37:57.387 --> 00:37:58.467
What's wrong with it?

00:37:58.827 --> 00:38:00.267
In Yuehai, I have the final say.

00:38:03.506 --> 00:38:04.226
This Zheng Decheng

00:38:04.907 --> 00:38:06.987
is now running wild in Yuehai.

00:38:07.666 --> 00:38:09.747
Secretary, you must intervene.

00:38:11.387 --> 00:38:12.506
What do you mean?

00:38:13.066 --> 00:38:14.387
Zheng Decheng is too bold

00:38:14.747 --> 00:38:15.267
and greedy.

00:38:15.787 --> 00:38:17.626
You should get someone to restrain him.

00:38:17.827 --> 00:38:19.626
Can't let him have his own way.

00:38:19.947 --> 00:38:21.387
We must handle problem critically.

00:38:21.867 --> 00:38:22.546
I think this way

00:38:22.706 --> 00:38:25.987
would be beneficial
for the future development of Yuehai.

00:38:26.827 --> 00:38:29.666
Actually, Zheng Decheng
has approached me several times.

00:38:30.186 --> 00:38:30.686
He wants

00:38:30.947 --> 00:38:32.106
to team up with Xie Chunlai.

00:38:32.827 --> 00:38:34.546
I've also looked into Xie Chunlai.

00:38:34.907 --> 00:38:35.706
He's highly capable.

00:38:36.307 --> 00:38:36.827
Furthermore,

00:38:37.688 --> 00:38:39.228
he knows how to deal with the people.

00:38:39.626 --> 00:38:41.787
And his wife
is a representative of the 'monkeys'.

00:38:42.226 --> 00:38:44.347
This will benefit
the future city-building work.

00:38:44.907 --> 00:38:47.026
Moreover, he has two capable men
under his command.

00:38:47.546 --> 00:38:48.586
One is named Lin Dongfu,

00:38:48.907 --> 00:38:52.106
upright and steady,
not much of a talker, a doer.

00:38:52.787 --> 00:38:54.026
Another is named Tan Guangming,

00:38:54.427 --> 00:38:56.626
meticulous and highly politically aware,

00:38:57.066 --> 00:38:58.267
also an outstanding cadre.

00:38:58.586 --> 00:38:59.186
Secretary.

00:38:59.666 --> 00:39:02.186
I know the three guys
that Guan mentioned.

00:39:02.747 --> 00:39:04.467
They were Zheng Decheng's subordinates,

00:39:04.867 --> 00:39:06.347
and cooperative with his work.

00:39:06.775 --> 00:39:09.345
Either becomes the Town Mayor
won't achieve our goal.

00:39:09.907 --> 00:39:10.936
None of them is suitable.

00:39:12.506 --> 00:39:13.347
Who then?

00:39:14.506 --> 00:39:15.186
Cai Gang.

00:39:16.146 --> 00:39:18.666
Cai Gang is steady
and has a broad perspective.

00:39:19.586 --> 00:39:21.467
Regarding Zheng Decheng's
working methods,

00:39:21.546 --> 00:39:22.626
he has certain doubts.

00:39:22.867 --> 00:39:24.307
He could serve as a mirror,

00:39:24.506 --> 00:39:26.267
constantly monitoring on Zheng Decheng.

00:39:26.787 --> 00:39:27.506
Mr. Xia,

00:39:28.146 --> 00:39:29.106
in my opinion,

00:39:29.626 --> 00:39:32.307
if two people
are working completely out of sync,

00:39:33.467 --> 00:39:36.026
it won't benefit the future development.

00:39:37.106 --> 00:39:38.066
In my opinion,

00:39:38.467 --> 00:39:40.907
Cai Gang isn't the best candidate.

00:39:42.106 --> 00:39:42.606
You...

00:39:43.226 --> 00:39:44.467
Both of you made good points.

00:39:45.387 --> 00:39:46.506
They have their strengths,

00:39:47.026 --> 00:39:49.347
but neither is the best candidate.

00:39:50.586 --> 00:39:51.947
Then, Secretary,

00:39:52.467 --> 00:39:54.666
do you already have

00:39:55.066 --> 00:39:56.427
someone in mind?

00:39:57.226 --> 00:39:57.947
There is one.

00:40:00.787 --> 00:40:03.467
Really? You've become the Town Mayor?

00:40:03.787 --> 00:40:05.706
Yes! I'm so excited!

00:40:06.546 --> 00:40:08.747
B-But my parents...

00:40:09.626 --> 00:40:11.467
Ms. Liu, you're the only one
who can help me.

00:40:12.066 --> 00:40:12.787
I got this.

00:40:14.066 --> 00:40:14.947
Wang!

00:40:15.606 --> 00:40:16.506
- Coming.
- Ms. Liu.

00:40:16.506 --> 00:40:18.146
Help me trace this lace pattern.

00:40:18.146 --> 00:40:18.747
Okay, Ms. Liu.

00:40:18.787 --> 00:40:19.626
Where are you off to?

00:40:19.706 --> 00:40:20.632
Saving someone.

00:40:20.632 --> 00:40:21.682
("Five Do's and Four Upliftings"
in Fresh Bloom)

00:40:21.682 --> 00:40:24.114
(General Affairs Dept, Archives)

00:40:25.307 --> 00:40:27.467
Really? Impossible!

00:40:28.506 --> 00:40:29.586
Where did you hear that?

00:40:30.467 --> 00:40:31.506
Where did I hear it?

00:40:33.307 --> 00:40:34.146
Not your business.

00:40:35.666 --> 00:40:36.987
But the news is reliable.

00:40:37.347 --> 00:40:38.546
I can't do this job anymore.

00:40:39.907 --> 00:40:41.706
Here. Take it.

00:40:41.987 --> 00:40:43.706
What's wrong with you?

00:40:43.907 --> 00:40:45.546
Even a donkey needs a carrot

00:40:45.626 --> 00:40:47.867
dangled in front to keep moving, right?

00:40:48.787 --> 00:40:49.666
Without motivation,

00:40:51.146 --> 00:40:51.827
who'd work hard?

00:40:52.706 --> 00:40:53.347
Lin, enough.

00:40:53.347 --> 00:40:55.267
Don't listen to Xie's nonsense.

00:40:55.500 --> 00:40:57.240
Appointing the Town Mayor
is a major matter.

00:40:57.240 --> 00:40:59.467
It'd definitely be the Secretary
who knows it first.

00:40:59.506 --> 00:41:00.467
Why would he know first?

00:41:00.506 --> 00:41:01.467
You don't understand me.

00:41:01.706 --> 00:41:02.546
Know what?

00:41:03.907 --> 00:41:04.907
Talking behind my back?

00:41:05.146 --> 00:41:05.787
Xie.

00:41:06.666 --> 00:41:07.166
Ask him.

00:41:10.546 --> 00:41:12.066
Well, he's leaving.

00:41:20.226 --> 00:41:22.747
Here are the main gate
and side gate keys.

00:41:24.307 --> 00:41:26.186
This is the safe key.

00:41:26.666 --> 00:41:29.146
This is important, the archive room key.

00:41:34.907 --> 00:41:35.747
The warehouse key?

00:41:38.827 --> 00:41:39.706
Here it is.

00:41:40.987 --> 00:41:42.026
This is my

00:41:42.546 --> 00:41:43.546
private property.

00:41:43.987 --> 00:41:44.787
Motorcycle key.

00:41:46.467 --> 00:41:46.967
The seal.

00:41:48.026 --> 00:41:49.146
The county government seal

00:41:49.267 --> 00:41:49.767
is here.

00:41:50.307 --> 00:41:52.646
Wait, what's wrong with you, Xie?

00:41:54.066 --> 00:41:55.467
Secretary, nothing wrong with me.

00:41:57.907 --> 00:41:59.506
Secretary, the county

00:41:59.747 --> 00:42:01.586
is sending Li Qiuping

00:42:01.907 --> 00:42:03.427
to be Yuehai Town Mayor.

00:42:04.026 --> 00:42:05.267
Good news, but I won't stay.

00:42:05.267 --> 00:42:07.307
T-This is nonsense!

00:42:08.186 --> 00:42:09.146
I am the Secretary.

00:42:09.600 --> 00:42:11.700
If higher-ups were sending
Li Qiuping as Town Mayor,

00:42:12.146 --> 00:42:13.186
they'd notify me first.

00:42:13.747 --> 00:42:14.666
I haven't heard it.

00:42:14.987 --> 00:42:16.106
Impossible!

00:42:16.947 --> 00:42:17.907
Think I talk nonsense?

00:42:18.026 --> 00:42:18.947
- Heard it?
- Heard it?

00:42:18.947 --> 00:42:20.226
It is Li Qiuping.

00:42:20.307 --> 00:42:22.026
The one and only Li Qiuping.

00:42:23.186 --> 00:42:25.427
Secretary, I've been a deputy chief

00:42:26.387 --> 00:42:27.146
for nine years.

00:42:27.186 --> 00:42:31.307
These nine years, I've worked tirelessly
for the village and town.

00:42:31.960 --> 00:42:33.626
At least I gave it my all.

00:42:33.626 --> 00:42:34.387
We often hear it,

00:42:34.387 --> 00:42:35.267
but it's the truth.

00:42:35.586 --> 00:42:37.867
I've never made any demands
to the Party.

00:42:40.526 --> 00:42:41.026
Yes.

00:42:41.026 --> 00:42:41.907
A-All these years,

00:42:41.947 --> 00:42:42.987
I haven't slacked off.

00:42:42.987 --> 00:42:44.546
I've done so much for the town,

00:42:45.496 --> 00:42:46.616
but my family has suffered.

00:42:46.947 --> 00:42:48.952
I have neglected my family and career.

00:42:48.952 --> 00:42:51.026
I devoted myself
to building cities with you.

00:42:51.026 --> 00:42:53.496
I just wanted my life
to reach new heights.

00:42:54.360 --> 00:42:55.384
But now,

00:42:56.150 --> 00:42:56.650
I...
