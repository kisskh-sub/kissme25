WEBVTT

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:25.840
Don't say anything. Let's go.

00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:26.900
I'll take you away.

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:28.400
and leave Chang'an forever.

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:30.060
and leave this fearful place.

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:34.400
I also

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:37.360
leave the Chamber of Commerce forever.

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:38.730
Leave Chang'an?

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:43.860
Leave this place where you eat people without spitting bones.

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:48.079
But Ziqi,

00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:49.880
I can't leave.

00:02:51.240 --> 00:02:52.560
I worked so hard

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:55.560
to bear the humiliation and be a dog.

00:02:57.680 --> 00:02:58.680
to

00:02:59.600 --> 00:03:00.560
to bring

00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:03.520
who was exiled.

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:06.520
and bring glory to our family.

00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:07.840
But now,

00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:10.000
there are rumors about you everywhere in Chang'an.

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:12.240
The Chamber of Commerce won't let you go.

00:03:12.240 --> 00:03:13.100
How about this?

00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:14.860
If you really want to stay,

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:16.730
I'll help you lift the chamber.

00:03:24.240 --> 00:03:25.880
and shake the tree.

00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:28.280
Fight a rock with an egg.

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:32.730
You really don't want to leave?

00:03:33.079 --> 00:03:33.960
It's just

00:03:34.800 --> 00:03:36.960
be a dog who endures it.

00:03:38.079 --> 00:03:40.360
It's just that in the past,

00:03:41.240 --> 00:03:42.680
to the elders.

00:03:43.880 --> 00:03:46.680
Now you can shake your tail to more people

00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:48.240
Shameless.

00:03:48.880 --> 00:03:49.680
[Face]

00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:51.210
and reputation.

00:03:52.720 --> 00:03:54.440
When I restore my family,

00:03:55.400 --> 00:03:57.000
I'll get them all back.

00:03:59.880 --> 00:04:00.520
Okay.

00:04:00.960 --> 00:04:02.420
If you decide not to leave,

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:04.530
I'll always be by your side.

00:04:10.840 --> 00:04:11.560
Ziqi.

00:04:12.600 --> 00:04:14.260
How many times have I told you?

00:04:14.800 --> 00:04:16.529
About the Chamber of Commerce,

00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:18.600
as far as you can.

00:04:19.680 --> 00:04:21.810
But you are in the Chamber of Commerce.

00:04:22.280 --> 00:04:24.410
I'm afraid you'll get involved again.

00:04:24.480 --> 00:04:26.480
you won't be in Chang'an.

00:04:27.800 --> 00:04:28.600
Let me ask you.

00:04:29.720 --> 00:04:30.920
If you want to be a dog,

00:04:32.159 --> 00:04:33.159
Do you want Hua

00:04:33.159 --> 00:04:34.600
be a dog with you?

00:04:42.480 --> 00:04:43.600
I will protect her.

00:04:46.159 --> 00:04:47.920
I'll do my best to protect her.

00:05:02.360 --> 00:05:03.480
I will do

00:05:04.160 --> 00:05:05.240
I will do it.

00:05:06.160 --> 00:05:08.480
As long as you stop bullying Fang Li,

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:10.360
do you know

00:05:10.400 --> 00:05:12.840
represents to the Chamber of Commerce?

00:05:14.480 --> 00:05:15.240
A tool.

00:05:15.840 --> 00:05:16.680
Tools. Tools.

00:05:17.920 --> 00:05:19.000
You're a tool. You're a tool.

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:21.280
You are the tool of the Chamber of Commerce.

00:05:21.280 --> 00:05:24.240
and a tool to make money in the folk.

00:05:25.680 --> 00:05:27.140
So what do you want me to do?

00:05:27.920 --> 00:05:30.360
You misunderstood the Chamber of Commerce too much.

00:05:30.360 --> 00:05:33.720
In fact, we want the people to live and work in peace.

00:05:34.240 --> 00:05:37.360
The Tang has always regarded peony as a noble flower.

00:05:37.920 --> 00:05:40.920
The price of acquiring peony is extremely high.

00:05:41.480 --> 00:05:44.720
For the sake of the common people,

00:05:45.040 --> 00:05:47.480
for the sake of the people.

00:05:47.840 --> 00:05:50.040
As long as you plant peonies at home,

00:05:50.040 --> 00:05:51.040
and stay at home,

00:05:51.240 --> 00:05:53.800
the government will pay a lot of money to buy it.

00:05:53.800 --> 00:05:55.200
will benefit the people.

00:05:57.240 --> 00:05:58.480
That makes sense.

00:05:59.720 --> 00:06:01.120
makes sense.

00:06:01.920 --> 00:06:03.400
Go and promote it.

00:06:03.720 --> 00:06:07.000
and let everyone know the benefits of planting peonies.

00:06:07.280 --> 00:06:10.140
When the government acquired it with a lot of money,

00:06:10.600 --> 00:06:12.800
you will be rewarded.

00:06:13.600 --> 00:06:14.360
Benefit?

00:06:14.840 --> 00:06:16.400
The Chamber of Commerce

00:06:16.400 --> 00:06:18.680
the richest man in Tang.

00:06:21.240 --> 00:06:24.000
The richest man of Tang?

00:06:45.720 --> 00:06:47.360
Listen to the Chamber of Commerce.

00:06:47.360 --> 00:06:49.040
Be a good Oiran.

00:06:56.040 --> 00:06:57.240
Great! Great! Great!

00:06:57.800 --> 00:06:59.659
The richest man! The richest man!

00:07:04.280 --> 00:07:06.280
Don't miss it.

00:07:06.720 --> 00:07:09.720
A business opportunity to make a fortune Come quickly

00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:13.720
Peony is a national flower.

00:07:14.120 --> 00:07:16.720
Now the Chamber of Commerce is giving everyone

00:07:16.840 --> 00:07:18.400
to make more money.

00:07:18.720 --> 00:07:19.980
I've thought about it.

00:07:20.120 --> 00:07:21.600
Peony is indeed

00:07:21.600 --> 00:07:23.660
bought the peony the most every year.

00:07:23.720 --> 00:07:25.480
with the highest price.

00:07:25.840 --> 00:07:29.800
And the annual acquisition is very shocking.

00:07:29.800 --> 00:07:31.800
Don't miss this opportunity.

00:07:32.280 --> 00:07:33.560
Please line up.

00:07:33.800 --> 00:07:35.680
If you want to seize this business opportunity,

00:07:35.680 --> 00:07:37.600
Get in line to buy seeds from me.

00:07:40.120 --> 00:07:40.920
Me too.

00:07:43.480 --> 00:07:44.240
Give me one.

00:07:44.360 --> 00:07:45.600
I'll buy two more.

00:07:45.920 --> 00:07:46.720
Okay, thank you.

00:07:46.720 --> 00:07:47.720
Pay from the side.

00:07:49.040 --> 00:07:49.159
Here you are.

00:07:49.159 --> 00:07:49.800
Did you grow peonies?

00:07:49.800 --> 00:07:50.530
Give me some.

00:07:50.560 --> 00:07:51.040
Take it.

00:07:51.040 --> 00:07:52.040
Don't mention it.

00:07:52.040 --> 00:07:53.680
I just got a dozen of flowers.

00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:55.240
Everyone in Chang'an is crazy.

00:07:55.240 --> 00:07:55.800
This is yours.

00:07:55.800 --> 00:07:56.730
Yes. It's yours.

00:07:56.920 --> 00:07:57.920
I got 30 flowers

00:07:57.920 --> 00:07:59.400
to buy 30 flowers.

00:07:59.400 --> 00:08:00.720
It costs me more money.

00:08:01.160 --> 00:08:01.760
It's okay.

00:08:02.400 --> 00:08:03.920
When the court receives flowers,

00:08:03.920 --> 00:08:05.360
we'll earn more than we do now.

00:08:05.360 --> 00:08:06.120
I think so.

00:08:06.120 --> 00:08:07.580
We'll make a fortune then.

00:08:07.800 --> 00:08:08.480
Yes.

00:08:09.160 --> 00:08:10.360
Are you okay with that?

00:08:10.360 --> 00:08:11.720
I'll take you there

00:08:11.720 --> 00:08:13.040
after they all leave.

00:08:13.120 --> 00:08:13.920
Okay.

00:08:15.160 --> 00:08:15.820
Here you go.

00:08:16.560 --> 00:08:17.360
Me too.

00:08:17.360 --> 00:08:18.240
This is yours.

00:08:22.840 --> 00:08:23.680
What?

00:08:24.240 --> 00:08:25.700
Let me take you somewhere.

00:08:27.680 --> 00:08:29.400
What are you doing? Put me down.

00:08:29.400 --> 00:08:31.400
I kidnapped you to watch the sunset.

00:08:48.320 --> 00:08:49.240
So beautiful.

00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:52.730
This is the first time I watch sunset in Chang'an.

00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:56.840
It's so beautiful. It's falling very fast.

00:09:02.320 --> 00:09:03.120
Push

00:09:06.120 --> 00:09:07.840
This is the innerhouse.

00:09:08.240 --> 00:09:11.080
The people living here bought your peonies.

00:09:11.360 --> 00:09:12.480
Ordinary people.

00:09:16.080 --> 00:09:17.720
Let me show you their life.

00:09:18.120 --> 00:09:19.480
and see where they live.

00:09:30.480 --> 00:09:31.540
In the inner house.

00:09:32.520 --> 00:09:34.380
People like them are everywhere.

00:09:34.720 --> 00:09:36.180
a dozen people in a family.

00:09:36.360 --> 00:09:37.420
The monthly income

00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:39.530
is less than 50 copper cash.

00:09:39.600 --> 00:09:42.320
But the peony plants in Chang'an

00:09:42.520 --> 00:09:44.600
has been sold for over 20 copper cash.

00:09:44.880 --> 00:09:45.840
Many families

00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:48.360
are willing to bet on the acquisition

00:09:48.360 --> 00:09:50.490
to bet on the acquisition of the peony.

00:09:50.520 --> 00:09:51.480
Moreover,

00:09:51.760 --> 00:09:53.220
who have no savings at home

00:09:53.720 --> 00:09:55.600
You borrowed money from a loan shark.

00:09:55.600 --> 00:09:57.330
Just because they believe you.

00:09:57.600 --> 00:09:58.480
the peony

00:09:59.240 --> 00:10:01.300
will definitely sell at a good price.

00:10:09.720 --> 00:10:12.840
But I did look into the information.

00:10:13.360 --> 00:10:15.200
The court does attach great importance to

00:10:15.200 --> 00:10:16.480
the acquisition of peony.

00:10:16.480 --> 00:10:17.610
That was in the past.

00:10:18.120 --> 00:10:21.240
Now everyone in Chang'an is planting peonies.

00:10:21.600 --> 00:10:23.440
The amount of peonies has increased

00:10:23.440 --> 00:10:24.970
has increased by ten times.

00:10:25.360 --> 00:10:26.720
It's rare.

00:10:27.120 --> 00:10:29.720
These peonies might even be sold at a low price.

00:10:31.360 --> 00:10:33.480
And planting peonies

00:10:34.360 --> 00:10:35.880
to plant peonies.

00:10:36.120 --> 00:10:38.720
Many people have no skills to plant flowers.

00:10:39.240 --> 00:10:41.960
Peony plants many deaths.

00:10:42.360 --> 00:10:43.820
What should the people do?

00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:45.400
I didn't think that much.

00:10:46.360 --> 00:10:48.290
I didn't expect it to be so serious.

00:10:50.840 --> 00:10:51.840
I was careless.

00:10:52.720 --> 00:10:54.840
You didn't contradict me. You didn't?

00:10:54.840 --> 00:10:55.600
It seems

00:10:56.000 --> 00:10:57.920
you did listen to me this time.

00:10:59.720 --> 00:11:00.480
Do you know

00:11:00.880 --> 00:11:02.340
I didn't make the decision

00:11:02.600 --> 00:11:04.480
wasn't a decision I made.

00:11:04.880 --> 00:11:06.960
Why did my ancestors die?

00:11:07.480 --> 00:11:09.720
It's to keep the people alive.

00:11:10.480 --> 00:11:11.320
I can't stand

00:11:11.480 --> 00:11:13.600
let alone anyone bullying them.

00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:16.600
I don't want you to be the one.

00:11:18.440 --> 00:11:19.240
Xu Ziqi.

00:11:19.880 --> 00:11:20.810
What should I do?

00:11:22.320 --> 00:11:24.720
What should I tell the Chamber of Commerce?

00:11:25.080 --> 00:11:26.640
They are still bullying me.

00:11:28.480 --> 00:11:29.720
I've found it out.

00:11:30.120 --> 00:11:31.320
It's the Commerce. It's the Commerce of Commerce.

00:11:31.320 --> 00:11:32.440
on purpose.

00:11:32.480 --> 00:11:34.880
the court wants to buy peony at a high price.

00:11:35.080 --> 00:11:35.840
I used you

00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:38.480
I made a lot of money from the people.

00:11:40.840 --> 00:11:41.840
I really thought

00:11:41.840 --> 00:11:43.700
they would care about the people.

00:11:43.960 --> 00:11:45.520
They think I'm a tool.

00:11:47.240 --> 00:11:47.840
Right.

00:11:48.360 --> 00:11:50.120
I still have the money for the plants.

00:11:50.120 --> 00:11:51.920
I'll return it to the people now.

00:11:52.760 --> 00:11:53.440
Xiao Zheng.

00:11:54.240 --> 00:11:56.440
You can see the suffering of the people.

00:11:56.600 --> 00:11:57.440
Just do it.

00:11:57.720 --> 00:11:58.600
and change.

00:11:59.360 --> 00:12:00.960
and be

00:12:00.960 --> 00:12:02.480
in your mind.

00:12:21.600 --> 00:12:23.600
What did Xu Ziqi

00:12:24.640 --> 00:12:25.960
by Xu Ziqi?

00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:28.860
You have no idea

00:12:29.960 --> 00:12:32.120
when you were the Oiran

00:12:35.360 --> 00:12:36.890
you were really beautiful.

00:12:44.760 --> 00:12:45.840
Work hard and modest.

00:12:45.840 --> 00:12:48.360
Thank you. Keep fighting for your dream.

00:12:48.520 --> 00:12:50.720
Hua Xiaochi, come on!

00:12:53.600 --> 00:12:54.880
Sell everything

00:12:54.880 --> 00:12:56.840
and paid back all the money.

00:12:57.720 --> 00:12:59.360
Are you out of your mind?

00:13:01.240 --> 00:13:02.600
You spread the news

00:13:02.600 --> 00:13:04.530
about the acquisition of peonies.

00:13:04.880 --> 00:13:06.320
You cheated the people.

00:13:06.760 --> 00:13:09.240
Do you have a conscience?

00:13:10.840 --> 00:13:11.360
Zheng.

00:13:14.240 --> 00:13:15.360
Master Yi, please calm down.

00:13:15.360 --> 00:13:16.360
Please calm down.

00:13:16.720 --> 00:13:17.720
Please calm down.

00:13:19.760 --> 00:13:22.480
I’m disappointed in you.

00:13:22.880 --> 00:13:24.140
You should kneel here.

00:13:24.840 --> 00:13:27.600
As for this farmhouse slave, get lost!

00:13:29.520 --> 00:13:31.320
Zheng!

00:13:33.720 --> 00:13:34.760
Let's go together.

00:13:34.760 --> 00:13:35.720
Stop kneeling. Let's go.

00:13:35.720 --> 00:13:36.320
Let's go.

00:13:36.520 --> 00:13:37.360
Take him away

00:13:37.600 --> 00:13:38.480
Leave me alone. Let's go.

00:13:38.480 --> 00:13:39.120
Run! Run!

00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:41.600
Go!

00:13:44.520 --> 00:13:45.520
Separate hatred.

00:13:52.960 --> 00:13:53.600
Miss Xiao.

00:13:53.600 --> 00:13:54.440
Hang in there.

00:13:57.960 --> 00:13:58.600
Who hit you?

00:13:58.600 --> 00:14:00.400
It's Lord Xu. It's him. It's him.

00:14:03.960 --> 00:14:04.640
Who hit him?

00:14:05.080 --> 00:14:05.960
Who else could it be?

00:14:05.960 --> 00:14:08.200
Master Yi. He beat him so hard.

00:14:11.840 --> 00:14:13.440
Where is Li?

00:14:15.600 --> 00:14:17.600
He's still making her kneel.

00:14:18.320 --> 00:14:18.960
Yes.

00:14:19.480 --> 00:14:21.080
The four Elders are furious.

00:14:21.480 --> 00:14:23.080
Judging from the situation,

00:14:23.120 --> 00:14:25.120
I'm afraid he'll kneel for one night.

00:14:25.120 --> 00:14:27.840
Steward Yang, go to the Chamber of Commerce to investigate.

00:14:27.840 --> 00:14:29.320
I'll figure something out.

00:14:29.320 --> 00:14:29.960
Yes, sir. Yes, sir.

00:14:29.960 --> 00:14:30.720
I'll go now.

00:14:32.720 --> 00:14:34.600
Please take good care of her.

00:14:41.840 --> 00:14:43.480
It hurts. Be gentle.

00:14:45.000 --> 00:14:47.480
Master Yi is a martial artist, right?

00:14:48.320 --> 00:14:50.240
He's so strong.

00:14:51.320 --> 00:14:52.120
Look.

00:14:53.320 --> 00:14:55.000
They are all steamed buns.

00:14:56.840 --> 00:14:58.240
Why did you hit me so hard?

00:14:58.840 --> 00:15:00.040
Your face is swollen.

00:15:00.320 --> 00:15:01.360
How can you eat?

00:15:01.880 --> 00:15:02.740
How about this?

00:15:03.120 --> 00:15:04.760
I'll make some porridge for you tomorrow.

00:15:04.760 --> 00:15:06.760
Add some rough rice with chicken porridge.

00:15:06.760 --> 00:15:07.690
It tastes better

00:15:10.080 --> 00:15:11.880
I want some mushrooms

00:15:12.440 --> 00:15:13.760
It's crushed.

00:15:17.480 --> 00:15:19.280
Hua Xiaochi, what are you doing?

00:15:19.880 --> 00:15:21.440
Why are you drooling?

00:15:27.000 --> 00:15:27.840
Well...

00:15:28.360 --> 00:15:29.480
That Elder Ii

00:15:30.120 --> 00:15:31.960
is a devil.

00:15:33.240 --> 00:15:34.760
I'll remember her.

00:15:35.720 --> 00:15:36.600
Just wait.

00:15:36.840 --> 00:15:38.700
I'll teach her a lesson tomorrow.

00:15:39.320 --> 00:15:41.850
How dare you bully my brother and hit my woman!

00:15:45.520 --> 00:15:49.240
We're brothers too.

00:15:50.440 --> 00:15:51.240
Yes.

00:15:51.840 --> 00:15:53.440
You bullied my two brothers.

00:15:54.120 --> 00:15:54.880
Well,

00:15:55.480 --> 00:15:57.320
I'll return the money today.

00:15:57.320 --> 00:15:58.440
Did I do well?

00:16:00.240 --> 00:16:02.000
Nice, heroine.

00:16:02.200 --> 00:16:03.360
That's for sure.

00:16:03.720 --> 00:16:04.840
Who am I?

00:16:07.720 --> 00:16:09.000
Stop talking.

00:16:09.080 --> 00:16:10.360
You'll drool again.

00:16:40.000 --> 00:16:41.730
Spread these information out.

00:16:41.840 --> 00:16:43.370
and evacuate immediately.

00:16:43.480 --> 00:16:45.440
Don't let anyone see us.

00:16:48.440 --> 00:16:49.320
Oh no.

00:16:49.880 --> 00:16:52.080
The master of the Chamber of Commerce

00:16:52.080 --> 00:16:55.320
has an affair with a royal relative?

00:16:55.520 --> 00:16:57.360
You have an affair?

00:16:58.880 --> 00:17:01.600
As men,

00:17:01.720 --> 00:17:04.480
didn’t become the leader of the four Elders.

00:17:04.720 --> 00:17:07.160
but a little girl became the leader.

00:17:07.920 --> 00:17:08.760
Today,

00:17:09.280 --> 00:17:11.480
I finally understand

00:17:11.760 --> 00:17:14.160
I have something urgent to tell you.

00:17:14.720 --> 00:17:17.250
Get out if you want to make sarcastic remarks.

00:17:19.280 --> 00:17:22.079
I admire you for that.

00:17:22.400 --> 00:17:24.000
When Mount Tai collapses,

00:17:24.000 --> 00:17:27.720
You still look the same.

00:17:29.080 --> 00:17:30.480
You look so awkward.

00:17:30.640 --> 00:17:32.770
but you're still giving us a hard time.

00:17:37.280 --> 00:17:38.720
I'm a woman.

00:17:39.520 --> 00:17:41.050
As the leader of the elders,

00:17:41.320 --> 00:17:43.880
he's capable and capable.

00:17:45.160 --> 00:17:46.480
All these years,

00:17:46.720 --> 00:17:48.200
all these years,

00:17:48.720 --> 00:17:51.160
I would have died a long time ago.

00:17:53.200 --> 00:17:55.440
I've given you face

00:17:56.240 --> 00:17:58.080
I've given you enough respect.

00:18:06.280 --> 00:18:07.520
In this situation,

00:18:08.240 --> 00:18:10.560
I'm just a little girl.

00:18:11.000 --> 00:18:12.400
You have to admit defeat.

00:18:12.920 --> 00:18:15.160
No matter what.

00:18:15.720 --> 00:18:18.800
At least I have filled up

00:18:19.480 --> 00:18:21.160
for all these years.

00:18:22.240 --> 00:18:23.100
It's your turn.

00:18:24.320 --> 00:18:25.280
Can you do it?

00:18:28.200 --> 00:18:29.800
I'll find out sooner or later

00:18:30.320 --> 00:18:31.520
sooner or later.

00:18:31.520 --> 00:18:32.960
who did it.

00:18:33.720 --> 00:18:35.240
I didn’t do

00:18:35.640 --> 00:18:37.400
did this.

00:18:37.440 --> 00:18:39.080
It has nothing to do with me.

00:18:39.080 --> 00:18:40.400
I didn't do it.

00:18:40.480 --> 00:18:42.720
They're all on the same rope.

00:18:43.040 --> 00:18:45.080
with sharp knives hanging on their heads.

00:18:45.080 --> 00:18:47.440
Let me make it clear today.

00:18:48.000 --> 00:18:49.530
If something happens to me,

00:18:50.000 --> 00:18:52.040
I'll give you the ledger.

00:18:52.920 --> 00:18:53.920
By then,

00:18:55.160 --> 00:18:56.680
no one can live.

00:18:59.160 --> 00:19:00.520
Have some tea.

00:19:00.520 --> 00:19:01.480
We are friends.

00:19:02.000 --> 00:19:03.800
Calm down.

00:19:04.520 --> 00:19:05.320
Xiao Zheng.

00:19:06.480 --> 00:19:08.800
You can’t find Elder Yi now.

00:19:08.800 --> 00:19:10.680
This has spread throughout Chang'an.

00:19:10.680 --> 00:19:12.280
Master Yi must be angry.

00:19:12.280 --> 00:19:14.240
She used to be arrogant

00:19:14.240 --> 00:19:15.480
to order us around.

00:19:15.480 --> 00:19:17.520
She's now at the bottom of the valley.

00:19:17.520 --> 00:19:19.640
We need to negotiate with her now.

00:19:24.880 --> 00:19:25.880
Separate hatred.

00:19:25.960 --> 00:19:29.040
All the four Elders are farting.

00:19:29.400 --> 00:19:30.860
Other than your position,

00:19:31.280 --> 00:19:32.800
they're still doing

00:19:32.800 --> 00:19:34.000
something shameful.

00:19:35.080 --> 00:19:36.740
You are much better than them.

00:19:36.800 --> 00:19:38.600
Everyone in Chang'an knows that

00:19:38.760 --> 00:19:40.040
I'm just their puppet.

00:19:41.280 --> 00:19:43.280
But everyone in Chang'an likes you.

00:19:45.160 --> 00:19:45.960
Of course.

00:19:46.520 --> 00:19:48.580
They probably like your appearance.

00:19:49.480 --> 00:19:50.880
We know you.

00:19:52.720 --> 00:19:55.480
In my heart, no matter who you are,

00:19:56.200 --> 00:19:57.040
you're great.

00:19:58.920 --> 00:20:00.780
I just want to bring my mother back

00:20:01.200 --> 00:20:03.000
and bring glory to our family.

00:20:03.480 --> 00:20:04.520
You have to believe that

00:20:04.520 --> 00:20:06.780
you can bring them back with your talent.

00:20:09.080 --> 00:20:11.520
We will always be with you.

00:20:14.160 --> 00:20:16.720
You should've told me earlier.

00:20:18.720 --> 00:20:21.000
I always feel

00:20:21.720 --> 00:20:23.000
I was alone.

00:20:24.040 --> 00:20:25.520
But since I met you,

00:20:26.080 --> 00:20:27.520
after I met you,

00:20:28.920 --> 00:20:31.480
I finally feel I have a soul.

00:20:32.240 --> 00:20:33.040
Thank you.

00:20:35.400 --> 00:20:38.280
It's okay. Those bad guys.

00:20:38.280 --> 00:20:40.240
I'll try my best to fight for you.

00:20:57.440 --> 00:20:58.240
I...

00:20:59.480 --> 00:21:00.720
I'm so happy.

00:21:02.080 --> 00:21:02.880
From now on,

00:21:04.080 --> 00:21:07.960
you don't have to be alone in this world.

00:21:08.720 --> 00:21:10.000
A hundred years later,

00:21:10.920 --> 00:21:12.920
you have someone by your side.

00:21:13.720 --> 00:21:15.080
I’m relieved.

00:21:16.480 --> 00:21:17.160
Yang Lin.

00:21:18.240 --> 00:21:19.880
I can’t let a woman

00:21:19.880 --> 00:21:21.410
into the tiger's den for me.

00:21:22.480 --> 00:21:24.240
I have to show the Chamber of Commerce

00:21:24.240 --> 00:21:26.480
I'm on the same side with Xiao Zheng.

00:21:27.240 --> 00:21:27.880
My lord.

00:21:28.560 --> 00:21:29.760
What do you want to do?

00:21:30.680 --> 00:21:31.280
Propose?

00:21:37.680 --> 00:21:39.140
What you said last time...

00:21:39.920 --> 00:21:40.720
Elder.

00:21:43.720 --> 00:21:44.680
Who let you in?

00:21:44.680 --> 00:21:45.920
Search carefully.

00:21:46.640 --> 00:21:47.440
Yes.

00:21:57.160 --> 00:21:58.000
Lord Xu.

00:21:58.800 --> 00:22:01.000
It seems that you have been

00:22:01.000 --> 00:22:02.080
for a long time.

00:22:02.240 --> 00:22:03.040
Thank you.

00:22:03.640 --> 00:22:05.200
We delinquents

00:22:05.200 --> 00:22:07.200
We should do our best.

00:22:07.520 --> 00:22:09.480
Mr. Xu is in a bad mood today.

00:22:09.720 --> 00:22:11.720
Aren't you afraid that the road will be hard?

00:22:11.720 --> 00:22:13.280
Is my road hard?

00:22:13.760 --> 00:22:15.320
depends on

00:22:15.320 --> 00:22:16.720
my arrangement with God.

00:22:17.000 --> 00:22:18.640
Let’s see

00:22:18.760 --> 00:22:20.560
can get through this.

00:22:24.040 --> 00:22:25.760
Boss, we found nothing.

00:22:27.240 --> 00:22:28.000
No.

00:22:31.800 --> 00:22:32.440
Let's go.

00:22:33.480 --> 00:22:35.280
Lord Xu barged into the mansion today.

00:22:35.280 --> 00:22:37.080
to barge into the mansion today?

00:22:37.480 --> 00:22:38.640
We both know

00:22:38.720 --> 00:22:41.120
why I came to the Chamber of Commerce today.

00:22:41.320 --> 00:22:43.960
It’s my duty to search.

00:22:44.280 --> 00:22:45.640
If I can't find it today,

00:22:45.960 --> 00:22:48.520
it doesn't mean I can't find it in the future.

00:22:49.200 --> 00:22:51.720
Looks like Lord Xu is well prepared.

00:22:52.480 --> 00:22:54.200
You deserve

00:22:54.480 --> 00:22:55.800
You'll be the king. You'll be the king.

00:22:55.800 --> 00:22:56.660
The king of hell

00:22:57.480 --> 00:23:00.760
He only accepts evil spirits in the mortal world.

00:23:01.480 --> 00:23:03.720
This is a warning. Let's go.

00:23:09.720 --> 00:23:10.640
King of Hell.

00:23:10.640 --> 00:23:12.800
Did he know about the ledger?

00:23:12.800 --> 00:23:14.240
I'm afraid it's leaked.

00:23:14.960 --> 00:23:16.880
Xu Ziqi is hard to deal with.

00:23:17.080 --> 00:23:19.200
We need to find Lord Wu to solve this.

00:23:19.400 --> 00:23:20.730
The sooner, the better.

00:23:25.560 --> 00:23:26.720
Why are you here?

00:23:28.000 --> 00:23:28.730
You go first.

00:23:29.040 --> 00:23:29.440
Yes.

00:23:35.160 --> 00:23:37.640
I'm here to avenge you and Bang.

00:23:38.480 --> 00:23:41.000
I'm here to seek revenge for myself.

00:23:42.320 --> 00:23:43.240
That's good.

00:23:43.320 --> 00:23:44.650
It looks more powerful.

00:23:45.160 --> 00:23:46.520
Go. I'll protect you.

00:23:46.520 --> 00:23:47.850
She dares not bully you.

00:24:03.480 --> 00:24:07.080
Elder Yi, I want to talk to you alone.

00:24:10.640 --> 00:24:11.240
Lord Xu,

00:24:13.800 --> 00:24:14.930
Please come with us.

00:24:22.080 --> 00:24:22.720
Go ahead.

00:24:23.160 --> 00:24:25.640
Your scandal has become like this.

00:24:25.760 --> 00:24:28.160
I don't think people are interested.

00:24:31.000 --> 00:24:32.200
Let's work together.

00:24:33.920 --> 00:24:35.760
As long as you stop forcing me

00:24:35.760 --> 00:24:37.480
and do what we don't want to do,

00:24:37.800 --> 00:24:40.560
I have a way to help you regain the people's support

00:24:40.560 --> 00:24:42.920
and make the people believe you again.

00:24:43.880 --> 00:24:45.080
What do you want to do?

00:24:46.000 --> 00:24:47.400
Do something practical.

00:24:47.720 --> 00:24:49.480
What the people really need

00:24:49.880 --> 00:24:51.240
like a shelter,

00:24:51.480 --> 00:24:53.720
and sell them at a low price.

00:24:54.160 --> 00:24:56.240
We can also make some cheap cosmetics

00:24:56.680 --> 00:24:58.010
and benefit the people.

00:24:58.080 --> 00:24:59.960
Then the people will support us.

00:25:01.000 --> 00:25:02.720
I really don't understand.

00:25:03.440 --> 00:25:04.560
How could a woman like you

00:25:04.560 --> 00:25:06.880
Why would he like a stupid woman like you?

00:25:08.480 --> 00:25:09.410
What do you mean?

00:25:09.920 --> 00:25:12.560
Do you think I became the leader of the four Elders

00:25:12.560 --> 00:25:13.800
for the people?

00:25:14.040 --> 00:25:16.480
The Chamber of Commerce is doing a big business.

00:25:16.480 --> 00:25:19.240
You spent a year

00:25:19.240 --> 00:25:20.500
for the common people.

00:25:20.720 --> 00:25:22.720
is not as good as

00:25:22.720 --> 00:25:23.440
than mine.

00:25:24.000 --> 00:25:26.000
Why should I work so hard

00:25:26.000 --> 00:25:27.260
for those poor people?

00:25:27.520 --> 00:25:29.920
So you don't care about your reputation.

00:25:30.480 --> 00:25:31.320
or worry about

00:25:31.320 --> 00:25:33.560
Everyone in Chang'an is scolding you.

00:25:34.240 --> 00:25:36.560
Do you think I still care about my privacy

00:25:37.520 --> 00:25:39.980
I still care about my privacy being exposed?

00:25:40.200 --> 00:25:42.480
Even if everyone in Chang'an scolds me,

00:25:42.720 --> 00:25:43.720
So what?

00:25:44.480 --> 00:25:46.000
Can they defeat me

00:25:46.440 --> 00:25:48.480
or the people behind me?

00:25:49.200 --> 00:25:50.560
Do they dare to scold me?

00:25:50.720 --> 00:25:51.720
Just like you.

00:25:52.560 --> 00:25:54.490
you only dare to negotiate with me.

00:25:55.040 --> 00:25:56.520
If I don't agree,

00:25:56.880 --> 00:25:58.560
you'll still be helpless.

00:25:59.680 --> 00:26:01.280
This is the reason

00:26:01.800 --> 00:26:02.960
Human for fish.

00:26:03.240 --> 00:26:06.240
You're bullying me because you're rich and powerful.

00:26:06.520 --> 00:26:07.680
I am.

00:26:08.080 --> 00:26:09.720
I have no one to rely on.

00:26:09.720 --> 00:26:11.720
I started from scratch in Chang'an.

00:26:11.920 --> 00:26:13.720
I earned all my power

00:26:13.720 --> 00:26:15.560
by myself.

00:26:15.640 --> 00:26:19.160
Now that I have power, I use it.

00:26:20.400 --> 00:26:23.640
I'll make it clear today.

00:26:24.080 --> 00:26:26.480
Do you think I'm bullying you?

00:26:26.920 --> 00:26:28.720
I hate him for being invincible.

00:26:29.080 --> 00:26:32.240
It's not my fault

00:26:32.440 --> 00:26:33.560
It's not my fault.

00:26:33.560 --> 00:26:34.880
It's not his fault either.

00:26:34.880 --> 00:26:35.760
It's you.

00:26:36.160 --> 00:26:37.200
You don't understand

00:26:37.200 --> 00:26:39.000
what separation is.

00:26:39.400 --> 00:26:41.480
What are the rules of this world?

00:26:42.080 --> 00:26:43.160
People like you

00:26:43.640 --> 00:26:46.200
don't deserve to live in Chang'an.

00:26:47.040 --> 00:26:48.160
I don't understand.

00:26:48.160 --> 00:26:50.960
A person like you who doesn't care about human life

00:26:51.000 --> 00:26:52.260
deserve to be an elder?

00:26:53.000 --> 00:26:53.480
You...

00:26:56.760 --> 00:26:57.920
You barbarian!

00:26:58.080 --> 00:26:59.080
Get out!

00:26:59.480 --> 00:27:00.680
It's not me.

00:27:00.680 --> 00:27:01.760
I'll fire you.

00:27:01.760 --> 00:27:03.160
I quit.

00:27:05.960 --> 00:27:09.020
My legs are dirty if I step into the Chamber of Commerce.

00:27:09.720 --> 00:27:10.760
Bye.

00:27:10.760 --> 00:27:12.760
Why don't you chop off your legs too?

00:27:15.400 --> 00:27:17.240
I was just finding an excuse to throw you.

00:27:17.240 --> 00:27:18.200
Stupid woman!

00:27:21.200 --> 00:27:24.200
You're a barbarian! You're the best! You're the best!

00:27:27.320 --> 00:27:29.080
You finally became the Oiran.

00:27:29.280 --> 00:27:31.480
and ended up with these evil merchants.

00:27:33.560 --> 00:27:36.400
Forget it. I might as well set up my own brand

00:27:36.960 --> 00:27:38.560
and the Chamber of Commerce.

00:27:38.680 --> 00:27:39.760
I'll do R&D.

00:27:40.280 --> 00:27:42.000
I'm here to support you.

00:27:42.240 --> 00:27:44.040
I don't believe I can't figure it out.

00:27:44.040 --> 00:27:46.040
I don't want to live a pathetic life.

00:27:46.080 --> 00:27:47.880
I want to be the master of my life.

00:27:51.240 --> 00:27:53.080
I have to go and get a divorce.

00:27:53.080 --> 00:27:54.480
That's awesome.

00:27:56.480 --> 00:27:59.320
You've become more reckless lately.

00:27:59.520 --> 00:28:01.680
I asked you to arrange Hua Xiaochi

00:28:02.040 --> 00:28:05.240
but you acted on your own to investigate the Chamber of Commerce.

00:28:05.240 --> 00:28:06.880
You alerted the enemy.

00:28:07.800 --> 00:28:09.880
You even got yourself injured.

00:28:10.560 --> 00:28:11.420
Your Highness.

00:28:11.800 --> 00:28:14.200
Lord Xu took the punishment himself.

00:28:14.560 --> 00:28:15.560
He did it himself.

00:28:15.880 --> 00:28:17.200
by himself.

00:28:17.960 --> 00:28:20.920
I've been investigating the Chamber of Commerce for more than three months.

00:28:20.920 --> 00:28:23.880
The Chamber of Commerce is extremely cautious.

00:28:24.240 --> 00:28:25.480
Instead of waiting,

00:28:25.720 --> 00:28:27.320
we should lure the snake out.

00:28:27.680 --> 00:28:28.560
I will

00:28:29.080 --> 00:28:31.040
will make you worry.

00:28:31.720 --> 00:28:33.580
and start to transfer the ledger.

00:28:35.960 --> 00:28:36.820
Release hatred

00:28:39.040 --> 00:28:40.040
[Falling in love]

00:28:50.080 --> 00:28:51.280
He's here. He's here.

00:28:51.720 --> 00:28:52.780
Where is your lord?

00:28:53.160 --> 00:28:54.400
I don't know.

00:28:54.480 --> 00:28:55.540
As soon as you left,

00:28:55.680 --> 00:28:57.760
The Lord went out with Butler Yang

00:28:57.960 --> 00:28:59.090
and never came back.

00:29:01.880 --> 00:29:04.480
Oh no, was I too arrogant?

00:29:04.800 --> 00:29:07.240
The Chamber of Commerce took away the Separation Greed.

00:29:07.240 --> 00:29:10.400
I can't defeat the Chamber of Commerce alone.

00:29:11.040 --> 00:29:12.720
No, I have to find Xu Ziqi.

00:29:14.320 --> 00:29:15.560
It sounds like

00:29:16.520 --> 00:29:19.480
you planned all this.

00:29:19.920 --> 00:29:23.250
Then why did you take the initiative to take the punishment?

00:29:25.520 --> 00:29:27.240
Because I like Hua Xiaochi.

00:29:27.680 --> 00:29:29.010
The Chamber of Commerce

00:29:29.400 --> 00:29:30.930
of the Chamber of Commerce.

00:29:31.080 --> 00:29:33.000
I should handle it myself.

00:29:34.440 --> 00:29:35.640
She is the one I love.

00:29:36.520 --> 00:29:37.320
So,

00:29:37.720 --> 00:29:39.480
I can't let her take the risk.

00:29:40.880 --> 00:29:42.280
What retirement?

00:29:42.720 --> 00:29:43.720
I don't want

00:29:44.280 --> 00:29:45.520
I don't want them all.

00:29:47.240 --> 00:29:49.080
I will never leave Chang'an.

00:29:49.720 --> 00:29:51.050
I won't leave the court.

00:29:51.680 --> 00:29:52.480
Xu Ziqi.

00:29:53.200 --> 00:29:55.600
You took Hua Xiaochi out of the city that day

00:29:56.000 --> 00:29:58.400
and left me a letter of self-condemnation.

00:29:59.080 --> 00:30:00.760
I knew

00:30:01.000 --> 00:30:03.680
you love this woman deeply.

00:30:04.480 --> 00:30:05.280
Fine.

00:30:05.920 --> 00:30:09.680
The Xu family is loyal to Tang.

00:30:10.280 --> 00:30:11.240
Don't worry.

00:30:12.000 --> 00:30:13.060
I won't let you die.

00:30:13.280 --> 00:30:15.480
let you die.

00:30:16.160 --> 00:30:18.040
and kill your Xu family.

00:30:21.000 --> 00:30:23.040
Thank you, Your Highness.

00:30:26.240 --> 00:30:27.280
Xu Ziqi

00:30:30.000 --> 00:30:31.040
Xu Ziqi. Xu Ziqi.

00:30:34.040 --> 00:30:34.880
Xu Ziqi.

00:30:36.280 --> 00:30:38.400
Jia Ding, have you seen Lord Xu?

00:30:38.640 --> 00:30:40.500
Are you also looking for Chief Xu?

00:30:40.920 --> 00:30:42.160
What happened to Xu Ziqi?

00:30:42.160 --> 00:30:43.960
After searching the elder’s home,

00:30:43.960 --> 00:30:45.240
Master Xu disappeared.

00:30:45.240 --> 00:30:46.800
We've been looking for him for almost two hours.

00:30:46.800 --> 00:30:47.880
There's no news.

00:30:50.400 --> 00:30:51.280
Keep looking.

00:30:54.520 --> 00:30:55.560
At this point,

00:30:56.280 --> 00:30:58.340
I want you to make up for your mistake.

00:30:58.920 --> 00:31:01.040
and fight against the four elders.

00:31:01.680 --> 00:31:03.280
and force them to attack you.

00:31:03.920 --> 00:31:05.450
Then you can pretend to die.

00:31:06.000 --> 00:31:07.280
Only if you die,

00:31:07.680 --> 00:31:09.400
if you die.

00:31:09.760 --> 00:31:11.020
the court will be fine.

00:31:11.240 --> 00:31:13.080
By investigating your cause of death,

00:31:13.080 --> 00:31:15.160
the cause of your death

00:31:15.640 --> 00:31:18.040
to make the four elders suspect each other.

00:31:18.480 --> 00:31:19.880
They will think

00:31:20.480 --> 00:31:22.720
they sent someone to harm you.

00:31:23.480 --> 00:31:25.800
The more they bite,

00:31:26.480 --> 00:31:27.960
the better it is for us.

00:31:28.680 --> 00:31:30.480
Understood? Yes, Your Majesty.

00:31:31.920 --> 00:31:33.380
Brilliant, Your Majesty.

00:31:33.720 --> 00:31:35.560
These two living people...

00:31:35.920 --> 00:31:37.880
Where have they been all day?

00:31:38.480 --> 00:31:40.240
Where did they go?

00:31:41.400 --> 00:31:43.560
Did I see a ghost or did they see a ghost?

00:31:49.000 --> 00:31:49.860
Hua Xiao Zheng!

00:31:52.280 --> 00:31:53.320
Ancestor

00:31:56.040 --> 00:31:57.760
A sudden breeze

00:31:57.960 --> 00:32:01.240
I feel like I'm only seeing you for the last time.

00:32:01.960 --> 00:32:03.400
I have to tell you.

00:32:03.400 --> 00:32:06.440
the last hint of your future husband.

00:32:07.280 --> 00:32:08.720
The last hint.

00:32:09.000 --> 00:32:10.280
From now on,

00:32:11.080 --> 00:32:14.280
go to Feng Hua Pavilion under the Giant Wild Goose Pagoda

00:32:14.520 --> 00:32:17.040
the first man you met.

00:32:17.280 --> 00:32:20.080
is your future husband.

00:32:22.520 --> 00:32:24.240
the first man you met.

00:32:24.920 --> 00:32:25.720
This is...

00:32:28.760 --> 00:32:30.000
Feng Hua Pavilion

00:32:38.520 --> 00:32:39.880
What are they doing?

00:32:40.440 --> 00:32:41.960
Yes, it's quite festive.

00:32:42.680 --> 00:32:45.010
Boss Xu, why don't you go in and have a seat?

00:32:46.080 --> 00:32:46.920
Let's go.

00:32:53.920 --> 00:32:55.960
Butler Husppy

00:32:56.320 --> 00:32:57.280
Why are you here?

00:32:57.280 --> 00:32:58.080
Miss Li.

00:32:58.240 --> 00:33:01.480
Come on, open this flower for you.

00:33:02.240 --> 00:33:03.240
For me?

00:33:05.680 --> 00:33:06.920
It's really a piece of cake.

00:33:06.920 --> 00:33:07.880
What is this?

00:33:20.280 --> 00:33:21.880
I don't want to play anymore.

00:33:22.080 --> 00:33:22.400
Wait.

00:33:22.400 --> 00:33:23.480
Here we go. Here we go.

00:33:23.480 --> 00:33:24.480
Let me bloom

00:33:35.080 --> 00:33:35.920
Xiao Zheng.

00:33:36.960 --> 00:33:38.240
I want to be

00:33:38.680 --> 00:33:40.920
in your life.

00:33:41.720 --> 00:33:44.560
Why didn't you do that

00:33:45.240 --> 00:33:46.320
make a flower?

00:33:46.440 --> 00:33:47.840
Because you like flowers

00:33:50.400 --> 00:33:51.320
Be serious.

00:33:51.320 --> 00:33:52.920
My lord is confessing to you.

00:34:04.720 --> 00:34:05.480
Xiao Zheng.

00:34:08.000 --> 00:34:10.060
This is the hairpin my mother left me.

00:34:11.000 --> 00:34:12.679
It's her last personal item.

00:34:17.520 --> 00:34:18.360
Xiao Zheng.

00:34:18.760 --> 00:34:19.840
My mother told me

00:34:20.080 --> 00:34:20.920
this hairpin

00:34:21.520 --> 00:34:23.449
can only be given to my future wife.

00:34:23.480 --> 00:34:25.679
We've only known each other

00:34:26.320 --> 00:34:27.199
until now.

00:34:27.480 --> 00:34:28.480
Walk side by side

00:34:28.840 --> 00:34:29.880
You comfort me

00:34:30.560 --> 00:34:31.620
and encouraged me,

00:34:32.080 --> 00:34:34.199
support me, cherish me,

00:34:34.480 --> 00:34:35.480
and love me.

00:34:36.040 --> 00:34:37.040
My love and hatred

00:34:37.080 --> 00:34:38.199
In this life,

00:34:39.000 --> 00:34:41.400
to have you by my side.

00:34:49.000 --> 00:34:49.679
Zheng.

00:34:50.400 --> 00:34:51.199
Marry me.

00:34:52.040 --> 00:34:53.480
I will use all my power

00:34:54.480 --> 00:34:56.010
to give you a peaceful life.

00:34:56.159 --> 00:34:57.200
and happiness.

00:34:57.560 --> 00:34:59.400
Well, I...

00:35:00.000 --> 00:35:00.840
Ms. Zheng,

00:35:01.120 --> 00:35:03.760
I used to hate you.

00:35:03.880 --> 00:35:06.200
But now I see you

00:35:06.680 --> 00:35:08.080
you finally have a smile.

00:35:08.480 --> 00:35:09.520
No matter what I do,

00:35:09.520 --> 00:35:11.480
I'm not alone anymore.

00:35:12.120 --> 00:35:13.180
Most importantly,

00:35:13.320 --> 00:35:14.480
as a woman,

00:35:16.040 --> 00:35:17.500
you care so much about him.

00:35:18.000 --> 00:35:19.130
and take care of him.

00:35:19.760 --> 00:35:21.890
I thank you from the bottom of my heart.

00:35:22.000 --> 00:35:23.480
Thank you for protecting me.

00:35:23.480 --> 00:35:27.040
Thank you for arguing with the Chamber of Commerce.

00:35:27.520 --> 00:35:28.480
From now on,

00:35:28.680 --> 00:35:29.600
I won't let you

00:35:29.600 --> 00:35:31.000
alone again.

00:35:36.560 --> 00:35:37.480
Xu Ziqi.

00:35:38.760 --> 00:35:40.840
Yes, I've been looking for him all day.

00:35:40.840 --> 00:35:42.320
Do you know where Xu Ziqi is?

00:35:42.320 --> 00:35:42.960
What?

00:35:43.560 --> 00:35:45.520
Xiao Zheng, I'm proposing to you.

00:35:45.840 --> 00:35:46.240
You...

00:35:47.480 --> 00:35:48.480
I'm here.

00:35:49.200 --> 00:35:51.040
Here, Lord Xu is here.

00:35:51.280 --> 00:35:52.480
Xu Ziqi

00:35:53.760 --> 00:35:54.360
Sir.

00:35:57.320 --> 00:35:57.920
Zheng.

00:35:57.920 --> 00:35:58.720
What's wrong?

00:36:01.280 --> 00:36:01.680
Ziqi

00:36:01.680 --> 00:36:02.140
My lord.

00:36:04.120 --> 00:36:04.960
Zheng!

00:36:12.120 --> 00:36:12.960
Zheng!

00:36:13.680 --> 00:36:14.480
Xu Ziqi.

00:36:14.480 --> 00:36:15.340
Why is your head

00:36:15.920 --> 00:36:17.040
Why is it swollen?

00:36:17.440 --> 00:36:18.200
Xu Ziqi.

00:36:19.400 --> 00:36:21.200
Are you going to die?

00:36:21.520 --> 00:36:23.280
Yang Lin, call the doctor.

00:36:23.480 --> 00:36:24.000
My lord.

00:36:24.480 --> 00:36:25.810
Are you proposing to me?

00:36:25.840 --> 00:36:27.320
It's not appropriate.

00:36:31.680 --> 00:36:32.040
Xu Ziqi.

00:36:32.040 --> 00:36:32.480
Ziqi

00:36:33.920 --> 00:36:34.680
Ziqi

00:36:35.480 --> 00:36:36.680
Call the doctor.

00:36:47.960 --> 00:36:49.560
Have some tea, my lord.

00:37:02.560 --> 00:37:03.880
Lord Xu

00:37:04.080 --> 00:37:06.320
I think he did it on purpose.

00:37:06.920 --> 00:37:08.640
Chang'an is such a big place.

00:37:08.960 --> 00:37:10.480
What's wrong with him fainting?

00:37:10.480 --> 00:37:13.080
He insisted on fainting in Hua Xiaochi's arms.

00:37:18.640 --> 00:37:19.120
Yae.

00:37:19.400 --> 00:37:20.400
How is Lord Xu?

00:37:20.480 --> 00:37:21.960
I was tapping Mr. Meng in the country.

00:37:21.960 --> 00:37:23.420
he was seriously injured.

00:37:26.640 --> 00:37:28.640
Did Hua Xiao Zheng agree to propose?

00:37:30.120 --> 00:37:30.640
Jin'er!

00:37:31.600 --> 00:37:33.120
Jin'er! Jin'er!

00:37:33.400 --> 00:37:34.680
Chairman Fang has already...

00:37:34.680 --> 00:37:35.520
He's asking for his hand. He's asking for his hand. He's asking for his hand. He's here.

00:37:35.520 --> 00:37:36.000
Yes.

00:37:36.320 --> 00:37:37.840
Zheng must have

00:37:38.000 --> 00:37:38.760
agreed.

00:37:39.000 --> 00:37:40.640
Why are you

00:37:40.640 --> 00:37:41.560
to pursue?

00:37:43.640 --> 00:37:44.440
No.

00:37:45.400 --> 00:37:46.400
You didn't agree.

00:37:47.120 --> 00:37:49.560
Of course I did.

00:37:49.880 --> 00:37:50.940
I want to see Mr. Xu.

00:37:52.880 --> 00:37:54.920
Where are Lord Xu and Xiao Zheng?

00:37:54.920 --> 00:37:55.280
Yes.

00:37:55.320 --> 00:37:56.520
Where's Hua Xiaochi?

00:38:03.600 --> 00:38:05.000
Be gentle.

00:38:05.640 --> 00:38:06.700
Why are you poking?

00:38:06.960 --> 00:38:08.000
Didn't you ask me to check your wound?

00:38:08.000 --> 00:38:08.840
I told you to be gentle.

00:38:08.840 --> 00:38:10.700
How do I know if I don't count them?

00:38:14.080 --> 00:38:14.920
Fine.

00:38:15.000 --> 00:38:15.840
Stop poking.

00:38:15.840 --> 00:38:16.970
Aren't you capable?

00:38:17.120 --> 00:38:18.680
to hurt yourself?

00:38:18.680 --> 00:38:20.340
What's wrong with poking you?

00:38:22.440 --> 00:38:23.120
It hurts.

00:38:24.200 --> 00:38:25.440
Xu Ziqi.

00:38:25.440 --> 00:38:26.280
I'll get mad.

00:38:27.080 --> 00:38:29.560
Xu Ziqi, I'm putting medicine on you.

00:38:30.840 --> 00:38:32.040
Miss Hua is so cruel.

00:38:32.280 --> 00:38:35.940
Lord Xu is covered with wounds and yet he still wants to poison him.

00:38:36.760 --> 00:38:38.280
Lord Xu, take a rest.

00:38:38.320 --> 00:38:39.160
Bite later.

00:38:39.360 --> 00:38:40.760
Judging from your teeth,

00:38:41.320 --> 00:38:43.000
he should be fine.

00:38:44.480 --> 00:38:45.320
I'm fine.

00:38:45.480 --> 00:38:46.520
It's just a minor injury.

00:38:46.520 --> 00:38:48.050
It should heal in a few days.

00:38:48.320 --> 00:38:50.580
But you still need to apply the medicine.

00:38:50.840 --> 00:38:52.440
Will you marry Mr. Fang?

00:38:56.880 --> 00:38:58.000
I'm asking you.

00:38:58.200 --> 00:38:59.000
Do you agree?

00:39:03.080 --> 00:39:04.880
Lord Xu is badly injured.

00:39:05.000 --> 00:39:07.360
Let's talk about this later.

00:39:07.360 --> 00:39:08.680
Lord Xu just said

00:39:08.680 --> 00:39:10.040
it's just a scratch.

00:39:10.280 --> 00:39:11.080
Answer me now.

00:39:16.480 --> 00:39:18.080
He's just comforting us.

00:39:20.880 --> 00:39:22.360
Right, Lord Xu?

00:39:34.000 --> 00:39:34.680
Lord Xu.

00:39:35.160 --> 00:39:35.760
Xu...

00:39:49.920 --> 00:39:50.680
Xu Ziqi.

00:39:52.080 --> 00:39:54.280
Why are you awake?

00:39:54.640 --> 00:39:56.000
In an emergency,

00:39:56.000 --> 00:39:57.400
I gave Lord Xu a pulse.

00:39:58.080 --> 00:39:59.600
If the acupuncture point goes down,

00:39:59.600 --> 00:40:01.000
unless it's a dead person,

00:40:01.000 --> 00:40:02.280
they will react.

00:40:05.280 --> 00:40:05.960
Then

00:40:07.080 --> 00:40:09.000
will you faint again?

00:40:14.960 --> 00:40:16.920
Lord Xu, are you sure you're okay?

00:40:34.080 --> 00:40:34.960
Don't worry.

00:40:35.480 --> 00:40:37.280
Lord Xu won't faint again.

00:40:37.840 --> 00:40:38.700
Unless he dies.

00:40:41.320 --> 00:40:43.080
Hua Xiaochi, answer me first.

00:40:43.160 --> 00:40:44.040
Let go of me!

00:40:45.320 --> 00:40:46.680
Wait, answer me.

00:40:47.320 --> 00:40:48.080
Answer me.

00:40:48.360 --> 00:40:50.000
Will you agree to Mr. Fang's proposal?

00:40:50.000 --> 00:40:50.530
Alright.

00:40:51.680 --> 00:40:53.040
Get down! Assassins!

00:40:54.600 --> 00:40:55.160
Where?

00:40:56.560 --> 00:40:57.120
Zheng.

00:41:01.040 --> 00:41:01.500
Jin'er!

00:41:07.840 --> 00:41:09.640
Help! Help!

00:41:15.360 --> 00:41:17.480
Brother, help!

00:41:17.480 --> 00:41:18.400
Protect me!

00:41:18.400 --> 00:41:19.280
Oops! Oops!

00:41:19.440 --> 00:41:19.840
Boss!

00:41:19.840 --> 00:41:20.320
Get a doctor.

00:41:20.320 --> 00:41:22.120
Did you forget to touch the carp?

00:41:22.360 --> 00:41:23.560
Something happened.

00:41:23.760 --> 00:41:25.200
Hurry, protect them.

00:41:25.320 --> 00:41:26.280
Hurry up. Let's go.

00:41:26.280 --> 00:41:27.360
Let's go.

00:41:27.680 --> 00:41:28.340
Xiao Zheng.

00:41:28.640 --> 00:41:29.160
Hurry!

00:41:29.160 --> 00:41:29.960
Don't pull me.

00:41:30.200 --> 00:41:30.860
Xiao Zheng!

00:41:32.000 --> 00:41:33.480
Catch the assassin!

00:41:36.160 --> 00:41:36.680
I...

00:42:03.840 --> 00:42:05.000
Am I not human?

00:42:05.320 --> 00:42:06.180
There's no one.

00:42:07.000 --> 00:42:08.520
to protect me?

00:42:13.880 --> 00:42:15.440
Is this

00:42:17.360 --> 00:42:18.640
feeling lonely?

00:42:19.480 --> 00:42:22.440
Ms. Yang, why are you lying down?

00:42:22.680 --> 00:42:26.600
You are our guide

00:42:27.280 --> 00:42:28.320
Stop howling.

00:42:28.960 --> 00:42:30.640
Why don't you pick a good day

00:42:30.640 --> 00:42:32.320
Why didn't you pick a good day?

00:42:33.560 --> 00:42:35.160
If I don't stop the bleeding,

00:42:35.480 --> 00:42:37.080
if I don't stop the bleeding.

00:42:37.400 --> 00:42:38.530
Where's the doctor?

00:42:38.920 --> 00:42:39.440
Yae!

00:42:40.440 --> 00:42:41.360
Doctor!

00:42:41.480 --> 00:42:41.940
Coming.

00:42:42.840 --> 00:42:44.200
Hurry up.

00:42:45.680 --> 00:42:46.480
Bite it.

00:42:47.320 --> 00:42:48.120
Hang in there.

00:42:48.480 --> 00:42:49.600
It'll be over soon.

00:42:53.160 --> 00:42:55.480
Miss Yang, you've lost too much blood.

00:42:55.480 --> 00:42:57.040
You need a strong prescription.

00:42:57.040 --> 00:42:59.120
You must use the blood of your closest relative as the guiding.

00:42:59.120 --> 00:42:59.680
Use mine.

00:43:00.000 --> 00:43:00.400
No.

00:43:00.400 --> 00:43:00.920
Use mine.

00:43:00.920 --> 00:43:01.560
No!

00:43:01.560 --> 00:43:02.800
Yae is fine.

00:43:02.800 --> 00:43:03.480
Listen to me.

00:43:03.480 --> 00:43:05.080
No, no.

00:43:05.320 --> 00:43:06.320
No.

00:43:07.360 --> 00:43:08.040
No.

00:43:12.160 --> 00:43:13.000
Xu Ziqi.

00:43:13.920 --> 00:43:15.600
Are you going to die?

00:43:17.400 --> 00:43:21.480
Don't laugh. You don't know how worried I was.

00:43:22.640 --> 00:43:24.000
You're badly injured.

00:43:24.000 --> 00:43:25.860
What if something happens to you?

00:43:29.000 --> 00:43:30.600
You were so worried about me.

00:43:35.040 --> 00:43:36.960
I just found out today.

00:43:37.880 --> 00:43:40.280
Your job is easy to get hurt.

00:43:41.040 --> 00:43:42.680
Why don't you quit?

00:43:44.480 --> 00:43:46.560
Fine, I quit.

00:43:46.800 --> 00:43:48.200
I won't do it again, okay?

00:43:51.360 --> 00:43:52.280
Stop crying.

00:43:52.920 --> 00:43:54.880
You're crying like I'm dead.

00:43:55.840 --> 00:44:00.080
I'm holding myself back. I'm not crying.

00:44:13.600 --> 00:44:14.660
What are you doing?

00:44:14.960 --> 00:44:16.440
Do you really want Jin'er to confess her love?

00:44:16.440 --> 00:44:17.520
Stop her!

00:44:17.960 --> 00:44:19.560
I do love Jin'er.

00:44:20.000 --> 00:44:21.200
But the more I do this,

00:44:21.440 --> 00:44:24.100
the more I can't let her do what she doesn't like.

00:44:36.760 --> 00:44:38.800
Hero, I'm annoyed.

00:44:40.080 --> 00:44:42.200
Mr. Bang has been

00:44:43.000 --> 00:44:45.320
for three years.

00:44:45.960 --> 00:44:46.760
I think

00:44:47.440 --> 00:44:49.120
it's time to talk to you.

00:44:53.560 --> 00:44:56.200
I used to be a lowly servant.

00:44:57.760 --> 00:44:59.360
Now I can make my own decision

00:44:59.920 --> 00:45:01.520
and live the life I want.

00:45:06.480 --> 00:45:07.160
I...

00:45:07.800 --> 00:45:09.600
I've admired you for a long time.

00:45:10.560 --> 00:45:11.880
I want to

00:45:12.200 --> 00:45:13.520
I wish you happiness

00:45:14.440 --> 00:45:16.440
I'm still waiting for you.

00:45:27.480 --> 00:45:28.280
Jin'er.

00:45:29.080 --> 00:45:30.610
My heart has already begun.

00:45:31.640 --> 00:45:32.520
I won't change

00:45:33.600 --> 00:45:34.930
Thank you for your love.

00:45:36.280 --> 00:45:38.680
I hope you can find a good man soon.

00:46:03.280 --> 00:46:05.080
I'm fine.

00:46:06.000 --> 00:46:06.800
Don't be sad.

00:46:07.600 --> 00:46:08.440
Jin'er.

00:46:08.880 --> 00:46:10.120
As long as you're willing,

00:46:10.120 --> 00:46:10.960
I will

00:46:11.480 --> 00:46:13.320
to marry you.

00:46:34.040 --> 00:46:37.080
Hero, I'm upset.

00:46:37.360 --> 00:46:39.560
I'm so upset.

00:46:44.880 --> 00:46:45.680
Good brother.

00:46:46.480 --> 00:46:47.400
Good brothers.

00:46:49.080 --> 00:46:49.960
Good brother.

00:46:52.680 --> 00:46:53.800
Shameless!

00:46:54.040 --> 00:46:55.480
Watch out for a big knife.

00:46:55.480 --> 00:46:56.680
will kill you.

00:46:56.960 --> 00:46:59.600
Then why didn't you do it?

00:47:01.000 --> 00:47:02.440
I was forced.

00:47:05.480 --> 00:47:06.560
Look.

00:47:08.480 --> 00:47:09.600
Shameless!

00:47:10.840 --> 00:47:12.320
He grabbed it tightly.

00:47:23.200 --> 00:47:23.880
Zheng.

00:47:32.520 --> 00:47:34.040
It's inconvenient for a man and a woman

00:47:34.040 --> 00:47:35.480
It's really inconvenient.

00:47:35.480 --> 00:47:36.480
I'd better

00:47:36.800 --> 00:47:38.060
another room for Ziqi.

00:47:38.360 --> 00:47:39.120
No need, Li.

00:47:42.120 --> 00:47:43.640
Well...

00:47:43.840 --> 00:47:46.360
How's Ms. Yang's injury?

00:47:47.360 --> 00:47:48.960
The doctor said he's fine.

00:47:49.520 --> 00:47:51.680
I'm here to see if you're scared.

00:47:55.920 --> 00:47:56.580
Xiao Zheng.

00:48:04.480 --> 00:48:06.920
I only have you in my heart.

00:48:07.880 --> 00:48:08.640
But...

00:48:09.280 --> 00:48:10.810
You haven't responded yet.

00:48:19.520 --> 00:48:20.160
Well...

00:48:22.080 --> 00:48:22.800
I...

00:48:23.000 --> 00:48:24.480
Bad news!

00:48:25.400 --> 00:48:27.800
Yang Debiao is not Steward Yang's daughter
