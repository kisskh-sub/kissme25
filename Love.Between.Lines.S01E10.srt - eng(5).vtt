[Episode 10]

00:01:58.360 --> 00:02:00.880
How am I supposed to explain to Zhao

00:02:00.900 --> 00:02:02.570
that I'm moving back?

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:16.950
Xiu,

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:18.400
help me finish the leftover cake

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:19.560
from my shop.

00:02:24.190 --> 00:02:24.750
Zhao, (Support Admin Watch on
kissasia.cam or kisskh.org)

00:02:25.329 --> 00:02:27.660
I'm moving back to my old place
in the lane.

00:02:28.820 --> 00:02:30.380
I've already discussed it with my boss.

00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:32.640
We're in the home stretch of the project,

00:02:32.820 --> 00:02:35.680
so it's more convenient for work
if we share a place.

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:39.140
That makes sense. I'd be worried

00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:40.310
if you lived alone.

00:02:40.579 --> 00:02:41.630
What did you say?

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:44.910
I said this room is too small.

00:02:45.230 --> 00:02:46.820
It's really not convenient for you
to live here.

00:02:46.820 --> 00:02:48.280
Moving back is a good idea.

00:02:51.980 --> 00:02:53.240
Let me help you pack up.

00:02:58.660 --> 00:03:00.310
It really isn't convenient.

00:03:05.540 --> 00:03:07.070
I'll take you back to the lane later.

00:03:07.070 --> 00:03:08.330
You have so much stuff.

00:03:08.420 --> 00:03:09.100
No need.

00:03:09.100 --> 00:03:10.950
My boss lent me his car.

00:03:12.350 --> 00:03:14.810
You're on such good terms with
your boss now?

00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:15.950
Not really.

00:03:15.950 --> 00:03:17.190
I just earned it

00:03:17.190 --> 00:03:18.630
by working overtime.

00:03:19.380 --> 00:03:20.100
Alright.

00:04:08.190 --> 00:04:08.820
Mr. Xiao.

00:04:09.420 --> 00:04:11.280
You just parked my car on the street?

00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:13.280
I just finished moving everything.

00:04:13.660 --> 00:04:15.580
I'll go park it in the lot now.

00:04:21.700 --> 00:04:22.230
Mr. Xiao,

00:04:22.780 --> 00:04:23.900
I can go by myself.

00:04:24.110 --> 00:04:26.430
It's just a short walk.
You don't need to come with me.

00:04:26.430 --> 00:04:28.290
But it's still a bit of a distance.

00:04:35.900 --> 00:04:36.670
Mr. Xiao,

00:04:36.670 --> 00:04:38.750
do we really have to wash the car
at this hour?

00:04:38.750 --> 00:04:40.220
It's just a bit of mud.

00:04:40.430 --> 00:04:41.760
And it's still raining.

00:04:43.900 --> 00:04:45.550
I've checked the weather forecast.

00:04:45.550 --> 00:04:48.150
The rain will stop
by the time the car is washed.

00:04:52.780 --> 00:04:53.380
It's okay.

00:04:53.550 --> 00:04:55.280
I can manage with only one hand.

00:05:00.260 --> 00:05:01.550
Then... then go ahead and wash it.

00:05:01.550 --> 00:05:03.340
I'll go back and unpack.

00:05:03.870 --> 00:05:04.380
Okay.

00:05:31.820 --> 00:05:32.950
You left something?

00:05:33.430 --> 00:05:34.190
Yes, yes.

00:05:34.190 --> 00:05:35.310
I left my conscience behind.

00:05:35.310 --> 00:05:36.430
Here, give it to me.

00:05:39.830 --> 00:05:41.030

Moving

00:07:30.260 --> 00:07:31.190

I remember you love these konjac jellies.

00:07:40.430 --> 00:07:42.030
Moving is quite exhausting.

00:07:46.220 --> 00:07:47.430
Especially when you have

00:07:47.430 --> 00:07:51.230
a roommate who doesn't understand
the meaning of "peace and quiet."

00:07:57.240 --> 00:07:58.150
Ms. Hu,

00:07:58.220 --> 00:08:00.510
why haven't I seen you at the café lately?

00:08:01.920 --> 00:08:03.600
I've already moved.

00:08:06.670 --> 00:08:07.670
Why?

00:08:07.950 --> 00:08:09.480
Is it because of that video?

00:08:09.870 --> 00:08:10.820
Video?

00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:13.150
What video?

00:08:27.190 --> 00:08:27.750
Okay.

00:08:28.400 --> 00:08:30.330
I'll communicate with them again.

00:08:30.550 --> 00:08:31.080
Goodbye.

00:08:32.620 --> 00:08:33.270
Mr. Xiao.

00:08:35.390 --> 00:08:36.789
I'd like to leave two hours early

00:08:36.789 --> 00:08:37.700
today.

00:08:38.070 --> 00:08:38.700
How about

00:08:38.700 --> 00:08:40.390
you take a taxi home tonight?

00:08:41.429 --> 00:08:42.289
What happened?

00:08:42.860 --> 00:08:43.500
It's Zhao,

00:08:43.620 --> 00:08:45.430
my friend who runs the café.

00:08:45.700 --> 00:08:47.070
She got into a fight at the club last time

00:08:47.070 --> 00:08:48.520
and got herself into some trouble.

00:08:48.520 --> 00:08:50.510
And I moved out
without knowing anything about it.

00:08:50.510 --> 00:08:52.510
I want to go back to the café for a bit.

00:08:53.430 --> 00:08:53.950
Okay.

00:08:54.910 --> 00:08:55.460
Wait.

00:08:56.620 --> 00:08:57.950
You have my keys, right?

00:08:58.250 --> 00:08:59.090
Take my car.

00:09:00.860 --> 00:09:01.990
Thank you, Mr. Xiao.

00:09:10.370 --> 00:09:12.030
Ms. Zhao, sorry to bother you.

00:09:14.070 --> 00:09:15.130
What's the matter?

00:09:17.220 --> 00:09:18.030
Ms. Zhao,

00:09:18.160 --> 00:09:19.680
I'm just here to notify you

00:09:19.740 --> 00:09:21.740
that next quarter, your shop's rent

00:09:22.100 --> 00:09:24.430
will be raised according to regulations.

00:09:24.820 --> 00:09:25.860
No, that's not right.

00:09:25.860 --> 00:09:27.800
I've already discussed this
with the industrial park management.

00:09:27.800 --> 00:09:29.670
I provide discounted coffee
in exchange for

00:09:29.670 --> 00:09:30.550
keeping the rent the same.

00:09:30.550 --> 00:09:31.810
Why the sudden change?

00:09:31.980 --> 00:09:33.070
Well...

00:09:33.340 --> 00:09:35.340
All those previous business arrangements

00:09:35.340 --> 00:09:36.980
are no longer valid.

00:09:40.340 --> 00:09:41.820
Did something happen?

00:09:42.700 --> 00:09:43.430
Ms. Zhao,

00:09:44.030 --> 00:09:46.390
your shop has been reported
for mixed commercial and residential use.

00:09:46.390 --> 00:09:46.950
We can't

00:09:46.950 --> 00:09:48.680
just ignore this kind of thing.

00:09:48.740 --> 00:09:50.100
After the leadership found out,

00:09:50.100 --> 00:09:52.390
they stopped
all previous cooperation with you.

00:09:52.390 --> 00:09:52.990
That's why

00:09:53.460 --> 00:09:55.790
they sent me here to verify the situation.

00:09:55.820 --> 00:09:58.980
But I specifically consulted with
the property management about this.

00:09:58.980 --> 00:10:00.030
My second-floor loft

00:10:00.030 --> 00:10:01.460
isn't open to the public.

00:10:01.460 --> 00:10:03.190
They said short-term residence
wasn't a problem.

00:10:03.190 --> 00:10:04.550
Yeah, that's true.

00:10:04.550 --> 00:10:06.460
Normally, we wouldn't be
so strict about it.

00:10:06.460 --> 00:10:07.260
But you see...

00:10:07.430 --> 00:10:08.760
someone filed a report,

00:10:08.820 --> 00:10:10.620
so we have to take action, right?

00:10:13.520 --> 00:10:13.980
Well,

00:10:13.980 --> 00:10:15.700
can you tell me who reported it?

00:10:15.700 --> 00:10:17.500
I'd like to discuss it with them.

00:10:17.550 --> 00:10:18.340
Well...

00:10:18.620 --> 00:10:21.030
I'm afraid
I can't disclose that information.

00:10:21.030 --> 00:10:21.860
Sorry about that.

00:10:21.860 --> 00:10:22.700
I found out.

00:10:23.900 --> 00:10:25.630
It was all Qian Jinxin's doing.

00:10:51.390 --> 00:10:52.100
Ms. Zhao,

00:10:52.310 --> 00:10:54.100
I've sent you the complete video.

00:10:54.100 --> 00:10:54.950
Maybe it'll help.

00:10:54.950 --> 00:10:55.910
You didn't know all along

00:10:55.910 --> 00:10:59.170
that your bestie was
flirting with another actor, did you?

00:11:00.890 --> 00:11:02.190
He hit a woman.

00:11:02.190 --> 00:11:02.980
He hit a woman?

00:11:02.980 --> 00:11:03.740
Shameless!

00:11:15.620 --> 00:11:16.270

00:11:19.310 --> 00:11:20.340

There's only one cup of cold coffee left,

00:11:39.670 --> 00:11:41.330
and the latte art is terrible.

00:11:41.600 --> 00:11:43.240
If you don't mind,

00:11:43.460 --> 00:11:44.460

I just transferred you here,

00:13:27.800 --> 00:13:29.150
and you've already caused
such a huge mess!

00:13:29.150 --> 00:13:30.150
What were you thinking?

00:13:30.150 --> 00:13:30.700
Boss,

00:13:31.030 --> 00:13:32.220
I'm innocent.

00:13:32.340 --> 00:13:34.700
It was those two girls
who were giving me trouble.

00:13:34.700 --> 00:13:35.270
Enough!

00:13:35.670 --> 00:13:37.230
There's a complete video online.

00:13:37.230 --> 00:13:38.430
Stop making excuses!

00:13:38.430 --> 00:13:39.620
Because of you alone,

00:13:39.620 --> 00:13:41.860
the reputation of the entire
industrial park staff has been tarnished!

00:13:41.860 --> 00:13:43.030
The impact is terrible!

00:13:43.030 --> 00:13:43.580
Come to my office

00:13:43.580 --> 00:13:44.340
first thing tomorrow morning!

00:13:44.340 --> 00:13:45.550
Boss, I was wrong.

00:13:45.550 --> 00:13:46.100
Boss...

00:14:09.750 --> 00:14:11.230
After you started sharing
an apartment with your boss,

00:14:11.230 --> 00:14:12.750
you're sharing a car too?

00:14:13.500 --> 00:14:14.900
Things between him and me

00:14:14.980 --> 00:14:16.860
are rather complicated.

00:14:17.150 --> 00:14:20.150
Once things get complicated,
they become dangerous.

00:14:23.790 --> 00:14:24.790
What does he want?

00:14:26.050 --> 00:14:27.650
Qian Jinxin, are you crazy?

00:14:27.820 --> 00:14:28.860
If you won't let me live in peace,

00:14:28.860 --> 00:14:30.280
neither of you will have peace!

00:14:30.280 --> 00:14:31.280
Xiu, be careful.

00:14:31.310 --> 00:14:31.950
It's okay.

00:14:58.070 --> 00:14:59.190
Stop right there!

00:15:05.930 --> 00:15:06.860
Pei Zhen?

00:15:08.420 --> 00:15:08.990
Xiu,

00:15:09.310 --> 00:15:10.970
we need to call the police now.

00:15:11.340 --> 00:15:18.650
[For plot purposes only—do not imitate]

00:15:54.610 --> 00:15:56.000
How did you even drive like that?

00:15:56.000 --> 00:15:57.300
You've got a death wish?

00:15:57.300 --> 00:15:58.900
Do you even know how to drive?

00:16:08.310 --> 00:16:08.670
Wait...

00:16:08.670 --> 00:16:09.980
W-What do you want?

00:16:12.390 --> 00:16:13.590
I've got a death wish.

00:16:13.670 --> 00:16:15.270
Go ahead and call the police.

00:16:16.810 --> 00:16:17.210
You...

00:16:19.550 --> 00:16:20.670
Are you nuts?

00:16:27.030 --> 00:16:27.580
Mr. Pei.

00:16:27.950 --> 00:16:28.620
Ms. Hu.

00:16:28.980 --> 00:16:30.430
I'm really sorry about tonight.

00:16:30.430 --> 00:16:31.390
It all happened so suddenly,

00:16:31.390 --> 00:16:31.950
and I...

00:16:31.950 --> 00:16:33.480
didn't see your car coming.

00:16:33.860 --> 00:16:34.430
It's okay.

00:16:34.430 --> 00:16:36.670
It wasn't your fault that the car got hit.

00:16:36.670 --> 00:16:39.500
Actually, you didn't need to
chase after him.

00:16:41.040 --> 00:16:42.270
I wasn't thinking much at that moment.

00:16:42.270 --> 00:16:43.460
I saw him running away,

00:16:43.460 --> 00:16:45.730
so I thought I'd take a shortcut
to stop him.

00:16:45.730 --> 00:16:47.550
Who knew he would turn around right then?

00:16:47.550 --> 00:16:48.950
Now that I think about it,

00:16:48.980 --> 00:16:50.220
it was pretty scary.

00:16:52.550 --> 00:16:53.790
Last time at the property site,

00:16:53.790 --> 00:16:55.850
did I put you in a difficult position?

00:16:56.390 --> 00:17:00.340
Mr. Xiao wouldn't make things difficult
for someone over such a small matter.

00:17:00.340 --> 00:17:01.860
I just think it's a pity.

00:17:02.100 --> 00:17:04.440
If our two companies weren't competitors,

00:17:04.440 --> 00:17:06.569
you and I could have been good friends.

00:17:07.430 --> 00:17:08.670
It seems we need to win

00:17:08.670 --> 00:17:10.530
the Design Competition quickly.

00:17:11.430 --> 00:17:12.980
He won't lose either.

00:17:18.530 --> 00:17:19.480
All done, Xiu.

00:17:19.980 --> 00:17:21.150
The police said

00:17:21.150 --> 00:17:23.220
that administrative penalties
for him and for us are inevitable.

00:17:23.220 --> 00:17:24.260
As for criminal liability,

00:17:24.260 --> 00:17:25.650
they'll investigate further.

00:17:25.650 --> 00:17:26.589
If they need our cooperation,

00:17:26.589 --> 00:17:27.720
they'll contact us.

00:17:29.460 --> 00:17:30.720
You're Mr. Pei, right?

00:17:30.780 --> 00:17:32.190
Thank you so much for today.

00:17:32.190 --> 00:17:33.500
-Nice to meet you.
-Sorry for the trouble.

00:17:33.500 --> 00:17:34.830
I just heard from the officer

00:17:34.830 --> 00:17:36.740
that vehicle damage claims are
quite complicated,

00:17:36.740 --> 00:17:38.150
and it seems you need some kind of
liability determination report...

00:17:38.150 --> 00:17:38.980
It's fine.

00:17:39.030 --> 00:17:40.050
My assistant is coming.

00:17:40.050 --> 00:17:41.390
I'll have him take care of it.

00:17:41.390 --> 00:17:41.980
Okay.

00:17:42.390 --> 00:17:43.060
Then,

00:17:43.060 --> 00:17:44.350
let's exchange contact info.

00:17:44.350 --> 00:17:44.540
Sure.

00:17:44.540 --> 00:17:46.110
If you need my help later,

00:17:46.110 --> 00:17:46.910
just contact me anytime.

00:17:46.910 --> 00:17:48.040
I'll scan your code.

00:17:48.840 --> 00:17:50.440
I was the one driving the car.

00:17:50.540 --> 00:17:51.430
But you were helping me with my situation,

00:17:51.430 --> 00:17:53.830
so of course I should take responsibility.

00:17:54.910 --> 00:17:56.350
Mr. Pei, so that's settled then.

00:17:56.350 --> 00:17:58.150
If anything comes up later,
just contact me directly.

00:17:58.150 --> 00:17:58.680
Alright.

00:17:58.980 --> 00:18:00.040
We'll be going now.

00:18:00.300 --> 00:18:00.870
Bye-bye, Ms. Hu.

00:18:00.870 --> 00:18:01.430
Bye-bye.

00:18:14.870 --> 00:18:15.350
Mr. Pei.

00:18:15.990 --> 00:18:16.870
Are you alright?

00:18:16.870 --> 00:18:17.400
I'm fine.

00:18:17.910 --> 00:18:19.630
Just finished dealing with the penalty.

00:18:19.630 --> 00:18:20.500
But I don't understand—

00:18:20.500 --> 00:18:21.670
why did you waste your time

00:18:21.670 --> 00:18:22.700
helping them?

00:18:26.220 --> 00:18:28.110
That's Xiao Zhiyu's car, isn't it?

00:18:28.110 --> 00:18:28.910
That's right.

00:18:29.130 --> 00:18:31.190
It's hard not to be curious, isn't it?

00:18:34.980 --> 00:18:37.780
You have to play the long game
to catch the big fish.

00:18:38.460 --> 00:18:39.460
What about your car?

00:18:39.460 --> 00:18:40.740
Should I take it in for repairs first

00:18:40.740 --> 00:18:42.110
and then deal with that guy, or...

00:18:42.110 --> 00:18:43.440
Just get rid of it for me.

00:18:50.980 --> 00:18:52.900
A defective product is
a defective product.

00:18:52.900 --> 00:18:55.430
It'll still be defective,
even if it's fixed.

00:19:11.430 --> 00:19:12.060
Mr. Xiao,

00:19:12.500 --> 00:19:13.700
you're still up?

00:19:14.460 --> 00:19:15.670
You startled me.

00:19:16.060 --> 00:19:17.390
If I could use this hand properly,

00:19:17.390 --> 00:19:20.250
I wouldn't be sitting here all night
doing nothing.

00:19:22.350 --> 00:19:23.390
I'm sorry.

00:19:23.910 --> 00:19:24.950
I...

00:19:26.150 --> 00:19:28.680
got held up
helping my friend with something.

00:19:29.020 --> 00:19:30.430
I can work now.

00:19:41.060 --> 00:19:42.260
Something happened?

00:19:46.260 --> 00:19:46.980
Mr. Xiao.

00:19:48.260 --> 00:19:49.150
Actually...

00:19:49.950 --> 00:19:51.020
just now...

00:19:51.260 --> 00:19:52.950
I almost crashed your car.

00:19:54.080 --> 00:19:54.840
Are you okay?

00:19:57.800 --> 00:19:58.430
But

00:19:58.450 --> 00:19:59.730
I ran into Mr. Pei.

00:20:04.870 --> 00:20:06.730
That's basically what happened.

00:20:07.350 --> 00:20:09.300
I don't know
why it was such a coincidence,

00:20:09.300 --> 00:20:11.230
but I thought I should let you know.

00:20:11.950 --> 00:20:12.500
Don't worry.

00:20:12.500 --> 00:20:14.560
I didn't talk about work with Mr. Pei.

00:20:14.590 --> 00:20:16.060
If there's anything
that needs to be handled later,

00:20:16.060 --> 00:20:17.520
I'll have Zhao take care of it
to avoid anything

00:20:17.520 --> 00:20:18.220
that could cause misunderstandings.

00:20:18.220 --> 00:20:19.020
Next time,

00:20:19.840 --> 00:20:22.570
contact the car owner first
if anything happens.

00:20:25.350 --> 00:20:26.460
I mean,

00:20:27.220 --> 00:20:28.220
contact me first.

00:20:30.780 --> 00:20:31.500
Got it.

00:20:36.740 --> 00:20:38.670
We're not continuing with the drawings?

00:20:38.670 --> 00:20:39.780
Get some rest.

00:21:39.850 --> 00:21:40.680
Hello, Zhao.

00:21:41.950 --> 00:21:42.500
Hello, Xiu.

00:21:42.500 --> 00:21:45.100
Check the industrial park's
announcement now.

00:21:45.100 --> 00:21:45.870
You know what?

00:21:45.870 --> 00:21:47.110
Early this morning,

00:21:47.110 --> 00:21:50.310
the park's leadership was waiting for me
at the entrance.

00:21:50.910 --> 00:21:52.710
Did they give you trouble again?

00:21:53.190 --> 00:21:54.110
No.

00:21:54.500 --> 00:21:56.540
The leadership
personally apologized to me.

00:21:56.540 --> 00:21:59.300
They said my cooperation with the park
will continue as usual.

00:21:59.300 --> 00:22:00.220
And the rent

00:22:00.300 --> 00:22:01.980
won't increase at all.

00:22:02.950 --> 00:22:03.910
That's great!

00:22:04.570 --> 00:22:05.220
That's not all.

00:22:05.220 --> 00:22:06.480
Let me show you a video.

00:22:14.540 --> 00:22:15.980
Stop filming... Stop filming!

00:22:15.980 --> 00:22:16.830
Someone like you

00:22:16.830 --> 00:22:17.500
should have been kicked out long ago!

00:22:17.500 --> 00:22:17.910
Stop filming!

00:22:17.910 --> 00:22:18.540
That's right!

00:22:18.540 --> 00:22:19.300
Stop filming!

00:22:19.300 --> 00:22:20.910
I've already apologized!

00:22:21.500 --> 00:22:22.540
Shameless!

00:22:22.540 --> 00:22:22.870
Don't cover your face!

00:22:22.870 --> 00:22:24.470
Stop filming! Stop filming!

00:22:24.780 --> 00:22:25.630
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

00:22:25.630 --> 00:22:26.430
Stop filming!

00:22:28.980 --> 00:22:29.980
I asked around.

00:22:29.980 --> 00:22:31.780
Apparently, the owner of ME Club

00:22:31.780 --> 00:22:33.150
pressured the park management,

00:22:33.150 --> 00:22:33.830
firmly refusing to allow

00:22:33.830 --> 00:22:35.910
someone like Qian Jinxin
to manage the park.

00:22:35.910 --> 00:22:37.780
So he was fired immediately.

00:22:39.210 --> 00:22:40.820
The ME Club owner?

00:23:05.260 --> 00:23:06.590
Good morning, Mr. Xiao.

00:23:06.590 --> 00:23:07.720
Breakfast is ready.

00:23:13.820 --> 00:23:15.260
That's what we didn't finish last night.

00:23:15.260 --> 00:23:17.060
Let's continue this afternoon.

00:23:17.220 --> 00:23:17.950
Also,

00:23:18.630 --> 00:23:19.630
this bowl of porridge—

00:23:19.630 --> 00:23:21.360
I bought it as a thank-you gift.

00:23:24.020 --> 00:23:25.430
You helped out with

00:23:25.690 --> 00:23:27.820
the vendors' protest too, didn't you?

00:23:28.780 --> 00:23:30.110
I just wanted to get justice

00:23:30.110 --> 00:23:31.240
for my injured hand.

00:23:32.670 --> 00:23:33.470
I understand.

00:23:34.300 --> 00:23:35.100
I understand.

00:23:39.980 --> 00:23:40.840
What are these?

00:23:41.590 --> 00:23:42.350
Onion bulbs.

00:23:43.020 --> 00:23:44.260
I want to grow green onions.

00:23:44.260 --> 00:23:45.630
If we're cooking at home,

00:23:45.630 --> 00:23:46.980
how can we not have green onions?

00:23:46.980 --> 00:23:47.540
Real onions.

00:23:47.540 --> 00:23:47.980
No need.

00:23:47.980 --> 00:23:49.240
Your delivery is here!

00:23:50.150 --> 00:23:50.700
Coming!

00:23:53.330 --> 00:23:54.220
Hello, your flowers.

00:23:54.220 --> 00:23:55.150
Thank you.

00:23:55.150 --> 00:23:55.910
Have a nice day.

00:23:55.910 --> 00:23:56.780
You too.

00:23:59.220 --> 00:24:00.020
Who sent them?

00:24:00.780 --> 00:24:01.980
I bought them myself.

00:24:04.230 --> 00:24:05.500
Is it also a thank-you gift for me?

00:24:05.500 --> 00:24:06.260
No.

00:24:09.590 --> 00:24:10.260
Of course, Mr. Xiao,

00:24:10.260 --> 00:24:11.390
if you like them,

00:24:11.910 --> 00:24:13.110
I can share half with you.

00:24:13.110 --> 00:24:13.740
No need.

00:24:18.780 --> 00:24:19.870
Another delivery?

00:24:21.220 --> 00:24:21.910
Xiu?

00:24:23.360 --> 00:24:24.510
Xiu, open the door.

00:24:24.830 --> 00:24:25.500
It's my dad.

00:24:25.830 --> 00:24:26.460
My dad is here.

00:24:26.460 --> 00:24:27.660
Quick, quick, hurry!

00:24:30.010 --> 00:24:30.650
Xiu?

00:24:40.020 --> 00:24:41.220
Bathroom! Bathroom!

00:24:46.950 --> 00:24:47.500
Dad!

00:24:47.830 --> 00:24:48.870
What were you doing?

00:24:48.870 --> 00:24:49.740
I've been knocking forever,
and you didn't answer.

00:24:49.740 --> 00:24:51.830
I... I was listening to music.

00:24:51.830 --> 00:24:53.630
I was... I was dancing in my room.

00:24:54.510 --> 00:24:55.230
Dancing.

00:24:56.260 --> 00:24:57.350
Why did you come so suddenly

00:24:57.350 --> 00:24:58.980
without telling me first?

00:24:59.910 --> 00:25:02.510
Do I... do I have to report to you
before coming?

00:25:02.830 --> 00:25:04.260
I... I guess not.

00:25:05.500 --> 00:25:06.780
I made some food for you.

00:25:06.780 --> 00:25:08.430
Get a couple of bowls and dish it out.

00:25:08.430 --> 00:25:09.060
Okay.

00:25:11.110 --> 00:25:12.710
Why is there a new table here?

00:25:13.500 --> 00:25:14.780
I needed it for work,

00:25:14.780 --> 00:25:15.840
so I just bought it.

00:25:20.830 --> 00:25:21.460
Xiu.

00:25:21.910 --> 00:25:22.840
Your mother and I

00:25:22.880 --> 00:25:24.410
came all this way
to bring you those two bottles of baijiu.

00:25:24.410 --> 00:25:26.270
You didn't give them to your boss?

00:25:28.190 --> 00:25:30.630
Dad, it'd be a waste
to give them to my boss.

00:25:30.950 --> 00:25:31.500
He...

00:25:31.670 --> 00:25:33.350
He has high blood pressure,
high blood sugar, and high cholesterol—

00:25:33.350 --> 00:25:34.670
he can't even have a sip of alcohol.

00:25:34.670 --> 00:25:36.150
If I eagerly gave him baijiu,

00:25:36.150 --> 00:25:38.220
w-wouldn't that show I'm clueless?

00:25:39.500 --> 00:25:41.150
T-That many health problems?

00:25:41.150 --> 00:25:42.880
You should've told me earlier.

00:25:43.150 --> 00:25:44.780
Dad, you don't need to bring me food.

00:25:44.780 --> 00:25:45.510
I think I

00:25:45.540 --> 00:25:47.060
can take care of myself.

00:25:47.350 --> 00:25:48.060
Before you

00:25:48.060 --> 00:25:49.430
say things like that next time,

00:25:49.430 --> 00:25:50.590
put away this junk food

00:25:50.590 --> 00:25:51.290
first.

00:25:51.310 --> 00:25:51.860
It's the middle of the day.

00:25:51.860 --> 00:25:53.460
Why are you having porridge?

00:25:53.540 --> 00:25:55.400
I-It's leftover from breakfast.

00:25:56.880 --> 00:25:58.800
Dad, don't worry about this.

00:25:58.870 --> 00:26:00.260
I still have

00:26:00.260 --> 00:26:02.190
a lot of work to do after I eat.

00:26:02.670 --> 00:26:03.590
If I can't

00:26:03.590 --> 00:26:04.950
complete my work on time,

00:26:04.950 --> 00:26:06.430
no amount of gift-giving will help,

00:26:06.430 --> 00:26:06.950
right?

00:26:07.390 --> 00:26:08.150
Right, right.

00:26:08.150 --> 00:26:09.870
Let me walk you out to get a taxi.

00:26:09.870 --> 00:26:10.690
Let's go. Let's go.

00:26:10.690 --> 00:26:11.020
Okay, okay.

00:26:11.020 --> 00:26:12.260
I'm really busy today, Dad.

00:26:12.260 --> 00:26:12.980
Okay, okay.

00:26:14.910 --> 00:26:15.740
Wait, no rush.

00:26:18.240 --> 00:26:19.300
What's that sound?

00:26:19.540 --> 00:26:21.400
Maybe Dazhong is taking a shower!

00:26:23.430 --> 00:26:25.190
His bathroom and our living room

00:26:25.190 --> 00:26:26.920
are only separated by one wall.

00:26:27.300 --> 00:26:28.630
No, the sound seems to be coming from
over there...

00:26:28.630 --> 00:26:29.540
That's empty.

00:26:29.540 --> 00:26:31.260
How could anyone be there, Dad?

00:26:31.260 --> 00:26:32.740
Let me walk you out. Put your shoes on.

00:26:32.740 --> 00:26:33.190
Okay.

00:26:33.430 --> 00:26:34.060
Let me help you.

00:26:34.060 --> 00:26:34.780
Okay, okay.

00:26:35.780 --> 00:26:36.260
This foot.

00:26:36.260 --> 00:26:36.910
Alright, that's it.

00:26:36.910 --> 00:26:37.190
Be careful with your leg.

00:26:37.190 --> 00:26:37.950
Go on with your work.

00:26:37.950 --> 00:26:39.020
I'll walk you downstairs, Dad.

00:26:39.020 --> 00:26:39.460
No need, no need.

00:26:39.460 --> 00:26:39.950
Let me walk you...

00:26:39.950 --> 00:26:41.300
Just focus on your work.

00:26:41.300 --> 00:26:41.830
Don't let me hold you up.

00:26:41.830 --> 00:26:42.300
Okay.

00:26:42.390 --> 00:26:42.870
Bye.

00:26:42.870 --> 00:26:44.390
I'll let you know when I'm free.

00:26:44.390 --> 00:26:44.920
Alright!

00:26:45.260 --> 00:26:46.690
Be careful going downstairs!

00:26:46.690 --> 00:26:47.170
Okay.

00:26:47.780 --> 00:26:48.310
Bye-bye!

00:26:48.460 --> 00:26:49.190
Bye-bye!

00:27:00.990 --> 00:27:02.050
What are you doing?

00:27:03.590 --> 00:27:04.260
Mr. Xiao,

00:27:04.540 --> 00:27:05.630
I'm really sorry.

00:27:06.780 --> 00:27:07.780
It happened so suddenly.

00:27:07.780 --> 00:27:09.110
I had no choice.

00:27:09.340 --> 00:27:10.540
But I promise you—

00:27:10.590 --> 00:27:11.540
three times max!

00:27:11.780 --> 00:27:12.870
Three times max?

00:27:13.390 --> 00:27:15.720
So that means there's still one more time?

00:27:16.430 --> 00:27:17.430
Oh, you're right.

00:27:21.760 --> 00:27:24.120
You even took a shower in there?

00:27:28.060 --> 00:27:29.460
My thermos container...

00:27:30.350 --> 00:27:31.220
-Dad!
-Dad.

00:27:33.190 --> 00:27:34.150
U-Uncle, hello.

00:27:36.930 --> 00:27:38.690
How did you get in?

00:27:39.260 --> 00:27:41.660
Why didn't I hear anything?

00:27:42.610 --> 00:27:45.670
-You didn't close the door.
-You didn't close the door.

00:27:56.690 --> 00:27:57.210
Dad,

00:27:57.500 --> 00:27:58.670
this is Yu.

00:27:58.840 --> 00:28:00.100
You've met him before.

00:28:01.350 --> 00:28:02.060
I know.

00:28:02.390 --> 00:28:03.460
You're colleagues, right?

00:28:03.460 --> 00:28:03.910
Yes.

00:28:04.670 --> 00:28:05.700
You came today

00:28:06.660 --> 00:28:08.060
to pick up a contract too?

00:28:08.670 --> 00:28:09.870
Uncle, I came to get...

00:28:09.870 --> 00:28:11.930
Go upstairs and change your clothes.

00:28:12.430 --> 00:28:13.490
Don't catch a cold.

00:28:17.330 --> 00:28:17.860
Go ahead.

00:28:30.260 --> 00:28:32.220
You said you wanted to
focus on your career.

00:28:32.220 --> 00:28:33.110
You said there were many things

00:28:33.110 --> 00:28:34.110
more important than marriage.

00:28:34.110 --> 00:28:35.470
I actually believed you.

00:28:35.470 --> 00:28:37.400
You've forgotten about
Zhang Qiran already, haven't you?

00:28:37.400 --> 00:28:38.930
I'm not against you dating.

00:28:39.110 --> 00:28:39.460
But

00:28:39.460 --> 00:28:41.740
how long has it been since you broke off
your engagement with him?

00:28:41.740 --> 00:28:42.300
And now, you're...

00:28:42.300 --> 00:28:44.310
well, you're already living together?

00:28:44.310 --> 00:28:45.830
This lane isn't very big.

00:28:45.870 --> 00:28:46.630
People see everything.

00:28:46.630 --> 00:28:48.160
What will they think of you?

00:28:48.300 --> 00:28:50.560
Why should I care what others think of me?

00:28:51.680 --> 00:28:53.720
Yu and I are living together.

00:28:55.170 --> 00:28:56.970
But we're not in a relationship.

00:28:57.170 --> 00:28:58.410
He's my tenant.

00:28:58.560 --> 00:29:00.480
To be precise, we're roommates.

00:29:00.830 --> 00:29:01.350
Room...

00:29:01.670 --> 00:29:02.590
Roommates?

00:29:04.830 --> 00:29:06.540
Do your other colleagues

00:29:06.540 --> 00:29:08.670
know that you two are living together?

00:29:08.860 --> 00:29:10.730
Will they gossip about you?

00:29:13.830 --> 00:29:14.960
My other colleagues

00:29:15.030 --> 00:29:15.870
won't know.

00:29:17.060 --> 00:29:17.790
That's good.

00:29:18.290 --> 00:29:20.090
Because I've already resigned.

00:29:23.300 --> 00:29:24.160
That baijiu...

00:29:24.700 --> 00:29:26.260
I never gave it to Mr. Xu.

00:29:27.300 --> 00:29:28.260
I got rid of him long ago.

00:29:28.260 --> 00:29:29.500
He doesn't deserve it.

00:29:29.500 --> 00:29:30.190
Also,

00:29:30.190 --> 00:29:31.390
I didn't rent out the loft

00:29:31.390 --> 00:29:33.020
because he was struggling financially

00:29:33.020 --> 00:29:34.150
or needed help.

00:29:34.830 --> 00:29:35.670
I did it

00:29:35.870 --> 00:29:37.800
because I wanted the money myself.

00:29:39.100 --> 00:29:40.900
Yu and I are indeed colleagues.

00:29:42.590 --> 00:29:43.630
He's my boss,

00:29:44.590 --> 00:29:46.950
the founder of D Design Studio.

00:29:47.590 --> 00:29:48.630
W-W-What?

00:29:48.630 --> 00:29:49.910
What? Design what?

00:29:50.060 --> 00:29:50.430
What?

00:29:50.430 --> 00:29:51.980
D Design Studio.

00:29:53.950 --> 00:29:56.150
It's an architectural design company.

00:29:57.500 --> 00:29:59.870
Why architectural design again?

00:30:00.260 --> 00:30:01.190
No, you...

00:30:01.890 --> 00:30:03.830
You said you weren't happy at work,
so you quit,

00:30:03.830 --> 00:30:05.090
and I understand that.

00:30:05.150 --> 00:30:06.260
Shanghai is so big.

00:30:06.430 --> 00:30:07.630
There are so many companies.

00:30:07.630 --> 00:30:09.500
You have experience
as a general manager's assistant,

00:30:09.500 --> 00:30:09.980
right?

00:30:10.060 --> 00:30:11.980
You could work at any company you want.

00:30:11.980 --> 00:30:13.870
Why do you keep jumping around

00:30:13.870 --> 00:30:14.700
and ending up back in architecture again?

00:30:14.700 --> 00:30:16.460
I like architecture.

What's good about working in architecture?

00:30:25.830 --> 00:30:26.550

But did you listen?

00:30:37.220 --> 00:30:38.030

Wasn't that a blessing in disguise?

00:30:54.190 --> 00:30:54.830
I thought that from then on,

00:30:54.830 --> 00:30:55.000

I never expected that today...

So?

00:30:58.980 --> 00:30:59.740
Three years ago,

00:30:59.740 --> 00:31:01.060

do we really have to move?

I've counted.

00:33:11.910 --> 00:33:14.830
It's 30 steps per floor.

00:33:15.110 --> 00:33:16.870

I'll help you walk.

00:33:20.150 --> 00:33:22.670
That way, your leg won't hurt.

00:33:23.540 --> 00:33:24.910
I don't want to move.

00:33:25.150 --> 00:33:27.150

Xiu, stop talking.

00:33:29.500 --> 00:33:30.910
It's not about your dad's leg.

00:33:30.910 --> 00:33:32.710
He's heartbroken, understand?

00:33:41.020 --> 00:33:42.630
Living at school is so convenient.

00:33:42.630 --> 00:33:43.780
Why did you have to move out?

00:33:43.780 --> 00:33:44.870
What a hassle.

00:33:45.260 --> 00:33:46.740
Xiu didn't tell you?

00:33:46.740 --> 00:33:48.740
The dorm shuts the lights off
at a certain time.

00:33:48.740 --> 00:33:50.590
She can only draw by a desk lamp,

00:33:50.700 --> 00:33:51.540
you know?

00:33:51.540 --> 00:33:52.150
Dad, Mom,

00:33:52.150 --> 00:33:53.500
I've redesigned our rooms.

00:33:53.500 --> 00:33:54.500
Go take a look.

00:34:02.630 --> 00:34:03.460
Dad? Mom?

00:34:04.940 --> 00:34:06.380
Why are you here?

00:34:08.639 --> 00:34:10.500
I'm taking your dad for a follow-up
at the hospital.

00:34:10.500 --> 00:34:12.330
We were passing by, so we came to see you.

00:34:12.330 --> 00:34:14.060
You became a regular employee?

00:34:17.020 --> 00:34:17.949
Actually,

00:34:17.969 --> 00:34:19.719
Shiyuan Real Estate is quite good.

00:34:19.719 --> 00:34:22.620
Your cousin wanted to work there before
but couldn't get in.

00:34:22.620 --> 00:34:24.750
I know. Let me walk you two to get a taxi.

00:35:11.730 --> 00:35:13.620
You ordered
all this fried chicken and fries,

00:35:13.620 --> 00:35:14.750
and you're just leaving it out here?

00:35:14.750 --> 00:35:16.410
At least take it inside to eat.

00:35:17.830 --> 00:35:18.890
And these flowers.

00:35:19.180 --> 00:35:20.060
If you leave them like this,

00:35:20.060 --> 00:35:21.120
they'll wilt soon.

00:35:39.830 --> 00:35:41.270
The onion bulbs fell on the floor,

00:35:41.270 --> 00:35:43.730
and you didn't even come out
to clean them up.

00:37:22.710 --> 00:37:24.770
The drainpipe under the upstairs sink
is broken.

00:37:24.770 --> 00:37:26.690
If you don't want the loft to flood,

00:37:26.690 --> 00:37:27.890
come up and fix it now.

00:37:28.500 --> 00:37:30.100
There are spare pipes
in the living room cabinet.

00:37:30.100 --> 00:37:31.460
You can replace it yourself.

00:37:31.460 --> 00:37:32.060
No.

00:37:33.020 --> 00:37:33.820
My hand hurts.

00:38:23.910 --> 00:38:25.830
Didn't we just replace the pipe
a few months ago?

00:38:25.830 --> 00:38:27.090
Why is it broken again?

00:38:27.500 --> 00:38:28.500
See for yourself.

00:38:44.390 --> 00:38:45.560
Are you messing with me?

00:38:45.560 --> 00:38:47.580
If I hadn't resorted to
such a dirty trick,

00:38:47.580 --> 00:38:50.660
you would've stayed in bed
until the Design Competition.

00:38:50.660 --> 00:38:51.660
I would not.

00:38:55.580 --> 00:38:57.620
But you were right about one thing—

00:38:58.270 --> 00:38:59.230
not telling my parents

00:38:59.230 --> 00:39:00.620
about changing jobs

00:39:01.450 --> 00:39:03.050
was like setting a time bomb.

00:39:03.990 --> 00:39:05.590
But you defused it yourself.

00:39:05.950 --> 00:39:08.610
Aren't you still standing here
perfectly fine?

00:39:10.790 --> 00:39:11.710
I have a way

00:39:11.870 --> 00:39:14.230
to help you forget everything temporarily.

00:39:14.230 --> 00:39:14.830
Wait here.

00:39:21.000 --> 00:39:21.910
Watch out.

00:39:21.910 --> 00:39:23.240
You're taller than I am.

00:39:27.570 --> 00:39:30.450
What's that method you mentioned?

00:39:40.640 --> 00:39:42.100
It really is a good method.

00:39:43.460 --> 00:39:44.140

Pretty good.

00:42:00.100 --> 00:42:01.430
I've figured it out now.

00:42:01.790 --> 00:42:03.580
There's only one shortcut

00:42:05.790 --> 00:42:06.790

00:42:11.830 --> 00:42:12.790
Something that difficult,

00:42:12.790 --> 00:42:14.250

00:42:16.910 --> 00:42:18.620
Though it's difficult,

00:42:19.260 --> 00:42:21.520
it can solve a lot of problems
all at once.

00:42:21.830 --> 00:42:22.460
Look,

00:42:22.950 --> 00:42:24.580
if we win this competition,

00:42:24.910 --> 00:42:26.710
I can become a regular employee.

00:42:26.870 --> 00:42:28.310
Once I become a regular employee,
I can get a raise

00:42:28.310 --> 00:42:30.390
and work on
the follow-up project implementation.

00:42:30.390 --> 00:42:31.140
When the project is implemented,

00:42:31.140 --> 00:42:33.070
I'll have a small accomplishment.

00:42:33.430 --> 00:42:34.390
Then, at that time,
no matter how my father...

00:42:34.390 --> 00:42:35.320
Hold on, hold on.

00:42:37.500 --> 00:42:39.020
You haven't "figured things out."

00:42:39.020 --> 00:42:40.550
You're clearly pushing me.

00:42:43.280 --> 00:42:44.550
I wouldn't dare.

00:42:48.350 --> 00:42:49.620
They should be out at their stalls now.

00:42:49.620 --> 00:42:50.180
Let's go, Mr. Xiao.

00:42:50.180 --> 00:42:51.360
Let's go grab some breakfast.

00:42:51.360 --> 00:42:52.290
What's the rush?

00:42:53.500 --> 00:42:54.460
I'm in a rush.

00:42:54.460 --> 00:42:56.140
I have to come back and draw the next one.

00:42:56.140 --> 00:42:57.500
Come on, get moving. Let's go.
