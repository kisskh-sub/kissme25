WEBVTT

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:56.280
Hua Xiaofei not becoming the courtesan

00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:58.140
suits our intentions perfectly.

00:01:58.440 --> 00:01:59.800
Go find Gu Jin'er

00:02:00.160 --> 00:02:02.290
and everything will return to normal.

00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:05.380
So the officials in the palace can rest assured.

00:02:06.160 --> 00:02:07.890
I'll take care of it right away.

00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:12.200
Why aren't you protecting Hua Xiaofei anymore?

00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:16.579
After spending these days together,

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:20.520
I deeply feel Hua Xiaofei is unsuitable for the guild's affairs.

00:02:20.960 --> 00:02:21.800
You have

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:24.620
developed real feelings for her.

00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:26.640
But you two are worlds apart.

00:02:27.079 --> 00:02:29.140
I fear she's clouding your judgment,

00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:32.040
making you forget what you should do,

00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:33.360
what you can do,

00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:34.960
and what you must do.

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:38.360
Elder Yi. (Support Admin Watch on
kissasia.cam or kisskh.org)

00:02:38.960 --> 00:02:40.640
Once a merchant,

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:42.700
forever despised?

00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:47.800
I am the head of the four elders of the Tang Guild

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:51.360
and the leader of all merchants in the Great Tang.

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:54.360
Yet I still cannot choose my own path.

00:02:55.480 --> 00:02:57.560
If this is my fate, what about yours?

00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:00.080
Fang Lihen.

00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:02.200
My parents are both dead.

00:03:02.320 --> 00:03:04.240
I no longer hope for marriage,

00:03:04.240 --> 00:03:05.360
being alone

00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:06.840
with no attachments.

00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:08.300
But you're different.

00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:11.660
I can no longer escape my merchant status

00:03:12.800 --> 00:03:15.920
and must serve Master Wu for the rest of my life.

00:03:17.520 --> 00:03:19.050
But you still have choices.

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:21.240
You have a path ahead,

00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:23.120
family to find,

00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:25.079
and someone you care for.

00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:27.520
Don't hesitate anymore.

00:03:28.040 --> 00:03:28.700
Otherwise,

00:03:30.240 --> 00:03:33.170
I'm afraid I won't be able to protect you completely.

00:03:33.240 --> 00:03:33.960
Elder Yi,

00:03:34.360 --> 00:03:36.890
why have you always taken such good care of me?

00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:37.960
Because...

00:03:42.480 --> 00:03:44.680
because you were chosen by our guild.

00:03:45.640 --> 00:03:47.400
If I had to find someone new,

00:03:48.360 --> 00:03:50.360
I fear I wouldn't have the strength.

00:03:51.520 --> 00:03:54.240
So don't make any more mistakes.

00:03:54.640 --> 00:03:55.760
Our lives

00:03:56.520 --> 00:03:58.320
cannot afford many mistakes.

00:04:00.080 --> 00:04:01.140
I understand, sir.

00:04:01.360 --> 00:04:01.960
You may go.

00:04:40.680 --> 00:04:41.810
I left in such a hurry

00:04:42.120 --> 00:04:44.980
I forgot to bring my family's miraculous medicine.

00:04:57.680 --> 00:04:59.440
Miss Yang.

00:05:02.880 --> 00:05:04.540
I apologize for my intrusion.

00:05:04.760 --> 00:05:05.760
Hello, Miss Yang.

00:05:06.120 --> 00:05:08.120
I heard today

00:05:08.120 --> 00:05:10.320
that you left the Fang residence early this morning.

00:05:10.320 --> 00:05:11.360
I wanted to

00:05:11.560 --> 00:05:13.960
see if you had really gone.

00:05:14.960 --> 00:05:16.560
I'm leaving right away.

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:18.800
You are indeed strong, sir.

00:05:19.200 --> 00:05:21.200
Those royal torture devices

00:05:21.680 --> 00:05:24.210
and you've recovered in less than three days.

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:27.120
What are you talking about?

00:05:27.120 --> 00:05:28.580
Please don't hide it, sir.

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:30.880
I applied medicine to your wounds.

00:05:30.880 --> 00:05:33.320
I saw your injuries very clearly.

00:05:34.320 --> 00:05:36.080
There's a course at the Imperial Academy

00:05:36.080 --> 00:05:38.320
that only students who excel for five consecutive years

00:05:38.320 --> 00:05:39.580
are qualified to take.

00:05:39.880 --> 00:05:42.409
This course is called 'The Art of Espionage.'

00:05:42.800 --> 00:05:44.200
Several lessons

00:05:44.360 --> 00:05:46.560
cover these unique torture devices.

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:48.600
The marks from these devices

00:05:48.680 --> 00:05:51.080
match exactly with the wounds on your body.

00:05:52.560 --> 00:05:55.080
Miss Yang, I think you've read

00:05:55.440 --> 00:05:57.080
too many books and made yourself foolish.

00:05:57.080 --> 00:05:59.080
How could you believe such nonsense?

00:05:59.080 --> 00:06:00.240
If you deny it,

00:06:00.440 --> 00:06:02.200
I'll go outside and tell everyone about it.

00:06:02.200 --> 00:06:04.320
That the Tang Dynasty's number one bailiff

00:06:04.320 --> 00:06:06.520
is actually a royal spy.

00:06:07.800 --> 00:06:10.130
Then you'll know whether it's true or not.

00:06:10.440 --> 00:06:11.640
Don't talk nonsense.

00:06:12.240 --> 00:06:14.000
Don't cause trouble for the court.

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:15.260
Everyone is very busy.

00:06:15.440 --> 00:06:17.500
If you agree to my one condition, sir,

00:06:17.560 --> 00:06:19.960
I'll keep this matter completely secret.

00:06:20.560 --> 00:06:21.360
Don't push it.

00:06:22.880 --> 00:06:26.240
Just agree to go on an outing with me alone, sir.

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:29.080
How long would this outing be?

00:06:29.120 --> 00:06:30.120
12 hours.

00:06:30.520 --> 00:06:31.520
One incense stick.

00:06:31.520 --> 00:06:32.360
6 hours.

00:06:32.680 --> 00:06:33.560
1 hour.

00:06:34.120 --> 00:06:35.120
2 hours.

00:06:36.320 --> 00:06:37.760
Deal. Now leave.

00:06:47.080 --> 00:06:49.200
I will arrange a time with you in advance

00:06:49.200 --> 00:06:50.860
and hope you won't stand me up.

00:06:52.320 --> 00:06:53.760
Through wind and rain,

00:06:53.880 --> 00:06:55.210
I'll be waiting for you.

00:06:58.680 --> 00:06:59.680
Xu Ziqi.

00:07:06.120 --> 00:07:07.000
You!

00:07:07.760 --> 00:07:08.960
Hello, Miss Xiaofei.

00:07:12.120 --> 00:07:13.240
Steward Yang, isn't your injury

00:07:13.240 --> 00:07:14.960
almost healed by now?

00:07:15.960 --> 00:07:18.320
Why aren't you back at the Imperial Academy?

00:07:18.320 --> 00:07:19.850
What are you two doing here?

00:07:21.080 --> 00:07:23.320
I invited Mr. Xu for a private outing.

00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:28.880
So Mr. Xu has agreed?

00:07:29.360 --> 00:07:31.240
He agreed. Very promptly agreed.

00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:34.000
How prompt.

00:07:34.560 --> 00:07:36.000
Not that promptly.

00:07:36.200 --> 00:07:37.440
It was quite prompt.

00:07:39.440 --> 00:07:40.680
It really wasn't prompt.

00:07:40.680 --> 00:07:42.680
Why did you agree if you weren't willing?

00:07:42.680 --> 00:07:43.200
I...

00:07:43.440 --> 00:07:45.080
So he agreed promptly.

00:07:46.760 --> 00:07:49.320
You agreed but weren't willing?

00:07:49.440 --> 00:07:50.080
Fine, fine, fine.

00:07:50.080 --> 00:07:51.540
Very prompt, very prompt.

00:07:59.120 --> 00:08:00.760
Xu Ziqi,

00:08:01.320 --> 00:08:02.720
you've got guts.

00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:07.800
What?

00:08:08.120 --> 00:08:10.200
So you're allowed to like rich people,

00:08:10.200 --> 00:08:12.000
why can't I like rich people too?

00:08:32.320 --> 00:08:34.320
Did I go too far with what I said?

00:08:44.560 --> 00:08:45.080
Sir,

00:08:45.600 --> 00:08:48.930
please forgive me for not being able to accept your request.

00:08:50.080 --> 00:08:50.720
Why not?

00:08:51.680 --> 00:08:53.940
These days when I'm not being a courtesan

00:08:54.080 --> 00:08:55.600
are the happiest

00:08:55.800 --> 00:08:57.440
and most free days of my life.

00:08:58.160 --> 00:08:59.820
I don't have to fake my smiles.

00:09:00.160 --> 00:09:01.760
I don't have to please others

00:09:01.960 --> 00:09:04.020
by singing songs I don't want to sing.

00:09:04.560 --> 00:09:05.400
Now,

00:09:05.920 --> 00:09:08.720
I'm finally free from being controlled by others.

00:09:11.320 --> 00:09:12.720
Please understand, sir.

00:09:13.800 --> 00:09:16.200
If you don't continue being the courtesan,

00:09:16.920 --> 00:09:19.600
how will you support such huge daily expenses?

00:09:20.560 --> 00:09:22.290
I've saved some money of my own.

00:09:22.960 --> 00:09:23.680
Although

00:09:24.080 --> 00:09:26.960
it's certainly not as comfortable as my previous life,

00:09:26.960 --> 00:09:27.800
I now

00:09:28.440 --> 00:09:30.900
can finally live according to my own wishes.

00:09:31.560 --> 00:09:32.890
All that past suffering

00:09:33.200 --> 00:09:35.080
wasn't it all for this very day?

00:09:46.080 --> 00:09:46.920
Are you really

00:09:48.080 --> 00:09:49.410
unwilling to come back?

00:09:51.560 --> 00:09:52.440
I am certain.

00:09:53.960 --> 00:09:56.280
Fine. I won't force you.

00:10:06.800 --> 00:10:07.440
Sir.

00:10:12.200 --> 00:10:13.460
Take care of yourself.

00:10:24.080 --> 00:10:25.080
This is so dirty.

00:10:25.320 --> 00:10:26.080
Yingxiong.

00:10:28.960 --> 00:10:29.720
Come in.

00:10:34.200 --> 00:10:37.280
Once registered as a merchant, it's the lowest social status.

00:10:37.280 --> 00:10:39.410
Only an imperial decree can change it.

00:10:39.480 --> 00:10:40.840
Miss, are you sure?

00:10:41.440 --> 00:10:42.280
I'm sure.

00:10:42.560 --> 00:10:43.090
Alright.

00:10:43.960 --> 00:10:45.420
Then I'll make the change.

00:10:46.840 --> 00:10:47.560
Wait, wait.

00:10:47.920 --> 00:10:48.720
What's wrong?

00:10:49.560 --> 00:10:50.960
This is one of the most

00:10:51.560 --> 00:10:53.680
important

00:10:53.840 --> 00:10:55.320
events in my life.

00:10:55.920 --> 00:10:57.960
Can I write it myself?

00:10:58.920 --> 00:10:59.560
No.

00:11:00.400 --> 00:11:02.800
Brother, please try a little.

00:11:03.160 --> 00:11:04.440
Maybe it's possible.

00:11:04.480 --> 00:11:06.200
Even if I try, it's not allowed.

00:11:06.200 --> 00:11:07.280
Please.

00:11:07.560 --> 00:11:08.620
Stop wasting time.

00:11:08.960 --> 00:11:09.680
Please.

00:11:13.160 --> 00:11:13.960
Official Xu.

00:11:16.840 --> 00:11:18.240
It's such a small matter.

00:11:18.440 --> 00:11:19.840
Just let her write it herself.

00:11:19.840 --> 00:11:20.840
Otherwise people might say

00:11:20.840 --> 00:11:22.440
you're abusing your power.

00:11:23.080 --> 00:11:23.800
Yes, yes.

00:11:23.920 --> 00:11:25.440
Official Xu is right.

00:11:57.560 --> 00:11:59.800
I feel like my life from now on

00:12:00.080 --> 00:12:01.810
will be completely different.

00:12:07.480 --> 00:12:09.920
Don't think that just because you helped me this time

00:12:09.920 --> 00:12:11.160
I'll forgive you.

00:12:11.560 --> 00:12:13.490
Who cares about your forgiveness?

00:12:13.560 --> 00:12:15.840
Besides, I didn't do anything wrong,

00:12:16.080 --> 00:12:17.680
you vain woman.

00:12:26.200 --> 00:12:27.080
Our Jin'er

00:12:27.440 --> 00:12:30.080
actually refused to compete for the title of flower queen,

00:12:30.080 --> 00:12:32.320
even though Chairman Fang personally came to invite you,

00:12:32.320 --> 00:12:34.050
and you rejected him so firmly.

00:12:34.320 --> 00:12:36.160
After these few days,

00:12:36.680 --> 00:12:38.600
I really don't want to go back to

00:12:38.600 --> 00:12:41.060
those humiliating and filthy days anymore.

00:12:46.440 --> 00:12:47.280
Jin'er,

00:12:47.680 --> 00:12:49.160
I need to tell you something,

00:12:49.160 --> 00:12:50.490
but you can't get angry.

00:12:51.440 --> 00:12:52.960
During the flower queen competition a few days ago,

00:12:52.960 --> 00:12:55.080
I was making wishes every day.

00:12:55.480 --> 00:12:56.080
And then?

00:12:56.200 --> 00:12:59.060
I wasn't wishing for you to become the flower queen.

00:12:59.320 --> 00:13:01.280
I was wishing that our Jin'er

00:13:01.560 --> 00:13:03.320
could leave this awful place soon

00:13:03.320 --> 00:13:04.850
and live the life she wants.

00:13:05.400 --> 00:13:07.200
But now seeing you so happy,

00:13:08.480 --> 00:13:10.280
I feel like my wish has come true.

00:13:13.080 --> 00:13:13.840
Yes,

00:13:15.720 --> 00:13:17.580
heaven has answered our prayers.

00:13:27.560 --> 00:13:30.680
The luckiest thing in my life, Gu Jin'er,

00:13:31.480 --> 00:13:32.680
was six years ago

00:13:33.320 --> 00:13:34.960
on that snow-covered road

00:13:36.320 --> 00:13:37.600
when I picked you up.

00:13:38.080 --> 00:13:38.920
Me too.

00:13:39.440 --> 00:13:41.960
My greatest luck was that out of all places,

00:13:42.200 --> 00:13:44.730
I collapsed on your way back to Pingkang Ward.

00:13:45.960 --> 00:13:46.560
Jin'er,

00:13:46.600 --> 00:13:47.960
I ran through more than ten streets

00:13:47.960 --> 00:13:49.680
to buy your favorite cherry biluo dessert,

00:13:49.680 --> 00:13:50.810
and it's still cold.

00:13:57.960 --> 00:14:00.080
But I only bought two portions.

00:14:00.560 --> 00:14:02.600
You and Yingxiong can share them.

00:14:04.280 --> 00:14:05.960
I'll be going now.

00:14:08.960 --> 00:14:10.680
Sit down and eat with us.

00:14:14.680 --> 00:14:15.280
Sit.

00:14:19.080 --> 00:14:21.210
Yingxiong doesn't like sweet things.

00:14:21.960 --> 00:14:23.200
I like them too.

00:14:23.400 --> 00:14:24.320
No, you don't.

00:14:37.560 --> 00:14:38.800
Drink slowly.

00:14:39.200 --> 00:14:40.460
You'll burn yourself.

00:14:42.720 --> 00:14:43.560
Jin'er,

00:14:44.080 --> 00:14:45.810
would you sell these cups to me?

00:14:46.400 --> 00:14:47.040
Why?

00:14:47.480 --> 00:14:47.960
Because

00:14:48.800 --> 00:14:49.560
this cup

00:14:49.680 --> 00:14:51.960
is the one you used to pour tea for me the first time.

00:14:51.960 --> 00:14:53.040
I need to keep it safe.

00:14:53.040 --> 00:14:53.960
From now on,

00:14:54.400 --> 00:14:56.530
you can come have tea with me every day.

00:14:59.320 --> 00:15:00.400
Every day?

00:15:07.480 --> 00:15:08.560
Every day?

00:15:16.040 --> 00:15:17.480
Jin'er, I promise you

00:15:18.080 --> 00:15:19.920
I'll come see you every day from now on.

00:15:19.920 --> 00:15:21.800
Whether it's windy or rainy,

00:15:22.320 --> 00:15:23.720
whatever you want to eat,

00:15:23.800 --> 00:15:24.800
no matter how far,

00:15:24.800 --> 00:15:25.960
I'll buy it for you.

00:15:26.920 --> 00:15:28.080
If it's not available anywhere,

00:15:28.080 --> 00:15:29.610
I'll make it for you myself.

00:15:29.960 --> 00:15:31.080
Anything you like,

00:15:32.720 --> 00:15:34.050
I'm willing to give you.

00:15:35.400 --> 00:15:36.330
Please sit down.

00:15:41.680 --> 00:15:42.940
Eat up. Have some more.

00:15:51.680 --> 00:15:52.320
This is

00:15:53.080 --> 00:15:55.200
that lonely feeling again.

00:16:23.080 --> 00:16:23.920
Why?

00:16:25.680 --> 00:16:27.480
I suddenly realize everyone around me

00:16:27.480 --> 00:16:29.040
has found a new path.

00:16:30.680 --> 00:16:31.720
Only I

00:16:33.280 --> 00:16:34.440
remain where I was.

00:17:04.960 --> 00:17:06.200
Oh my God!

00:17:08.200 --> 00:17:11.130
Why is starting a business so expensive everywhere?

00:17:11.200 --> 00:17:12.480
67 taels.

00:17:14.520 --> 00:17:16.720
Miss, here's your energizing matcha tea.

00:17:16.720 --> 00:17:17.849
Two taels of silver.

00:17:19.960 --> 00:17:20.760
Wait a minute.

00:17:23.760 --> 00:17:25.200
I suddenly have an emergency.

00:17:25.200 --> 00:17:26.000
Could you cancel this for me?

00:17:26.000 --> 00:17:26.859
I have to go now.

00:17:27.280 --> 00:17:28.760
Please cancel it for me. Thanks.

00:17:28.760 --> 00:17:30.040
But my tea...

00:17:33.960 --> 00:17:35.200
Respected friends,

00:17:35.360 --> 00:17:36.960
dear distinguished guests,

00:17:37.240 --> 00:17:38.680
good morning to you all.

00:17:39.160 --> 00:17:40.840
I am Hua Xiaofei,

00:17:41.160 --> 00:17:42.240
twenty years old,

00:17:42.360 --> 00:17:45.360
from the beautiful peony hometown of Huajia Village.

00:17:45.840 --> 00:17:49.040
I'm good at gardening, makeup, and business.

00:17:49.920 --> 00:17:51.360
Though I'm just a humble woman,

00:17:51.360 --> 00:17:54.200
I'm the one who developed this Noble Street.

00:17:54.240 --> 00:17:55.640
Well done!

00:17:55.640 --> 00:17:56.640
Excellent!

00:17:56.760 --> 00:17:58.440
I'm being modest.

00:17:59.040 --> 00:18:01.360
I'm planning to create my own beauty brand.

00:18:01.360 --> 00:18:02.240
Make a fortune.

00:18:02.840 --> 00:18:04.240
But just before opening,

00:18:04.440 --> 00:18:06.000
I suddenly realized something.

00:18:06.000 --> 00:18:08.440
If it weren't for everyone's help in the past,

00:18:08.440 --> 00:18:10.760
how could I be so successful today?

00:18:11.120 --> 00:18:12.050
So I've decided,

00:18:12.440 --> 00:18:14.520
joy shared is joy doubled.

00:18:15.360 --> 00:18:17.400
I want everyone to be involved.

00:18:17.480 --> 00:18:19.010
Everyone can participate.

00:18:19.440 --> 00:18:19.840
Right.

00:18:20.200 --> 00:18:22.400
It means working together.

00:18:22.640 --> 00:18:23.920
This business concept

00:18:24.680 --> 00:18:26.840
is called partnership.

00:18:27.000 --> 00:18:27.840
Partnership?

00:18:28.480 --> 00:18:29.740
What is a partnership?

00:18:30.160 --> 00:18:32.840
Joint investment means everyone contributes a portion,

00:18:32.840 --> 00:18:34.000
whether it's one string of coins

00:18:34.000 --> 00:18:35.200
or one tael of silver.

00:18:35.400 --> 00:18:36.000
Then,

00:18:36.240 --> 00:18:38.480
it's converted into corresponding investment certificates,

00:18:38.480 --> 00:18:39.640
or stocks.

00:18:40.240 --> 00:18:41.120
In return,

00:18:41.200 --> 00:18:42.800
I will distribute dividends

00:18:43.040 --> 00:18:44.520
to each investor

00:18:44.520 --> 00:18:46.450
according to their contribution.

00:18:46.720 --> 00:18:49.480
I absolutely won't let anyone's money go to waste.

00:18:49.480 --> 00:18:51.520
Can anyone buy your stocks?

00:18:52.200 --> 00:18:54.520
But considering the potential risks.

00:18:55.000 --> 00:18:56.040
This time,

00:18:56.040 --> 00:18:57.440
we're limiting purchases to

00:18:57.440 --> 00:19:00.600
one tael of silver as the maximum investment.

00:19:01.000 --> 00:19:03.440
Only 100 shares are available in total.

00:19:03.680 --> 00:19:05.140
First come, first served.

00:19:05.200 --> 00:19:06.680
Don't miss this opportunity.

00:19:06.680 --> 00:19:08.140
First come, first served,

00:19:09.040 --> 00:19:09.970
we need to hurry.

00:19:11.120 --> 00:19:15.280
If all ladies present believe in me

00:19:15.280 --> 00:19:16.160
and trust me,

00:19:16.680 --> 00:19:18.840
please boldly raise your hands

00:19:19.120 --> 00:19:21.680
to purchase these valuable shares.

00:19:22.280 --> 00:19:24.040
With your vote and my vote,

00:19:24.160 --> 00:19:25.880
Xiaofei will debut tomorrow.

00:19:26.200 --> 00:19:27.880
If you don't invest and I don't invest...

00:19:27.880 --> 00:19:30.360
When will Xiaofei ever succeed?

00:19:31.760 --> 00:19:32.360
Let's try.

00:19:32.440 --> 00:19:33.520
We need to help her.

00:19:34.520 --> 00:19:34.960
Yes, indeed.

00:19:34.960 --> 00:19:36.440
It's just a tael of silver.

00:19:36.520 --> 00:19:38.360
Just for fun. I'll invest.

00:19:40.120 --> 00:19:40.920
Hua Xiaofei.

00:19:41.440 --> 00:19:42.040
You!

00:19:45.600 --> 00:19:46.920
You stinking girl!

00:19:47.200 --> 00:19:49.240
I've been sick of you for a long time.

00:19:49.680 --> 00:19:52.240
If you're not going to be a courtesan anymore, get the hell away from me.

00:19:52.240 --> 00:19:54.240
Stop doing these shameless things.

00:19:56.200 --> 00:19:58.400
How dare you go against the Chamber of Commerce!

00:19:58.400 --> 00:20:01.200
I'll beat you to death right here in the street, you worthless trash.

00:20:01.200 --> 00:20:02.730
Let's see who dares stop me.

00:20:02.960 --> 00:20:04.020
What are you doing?

00:20:04.640 --> 00:20:05.280
What's going on here?

00:20:05.280 --> 00:20:06.880
Why are you being so violent?

00:20:06.960 --> 00:20:08.360
I've done nothing wrong.

00:20:08.880 --> 00:20:10.920
It's you people from the Chamber of Commerce who are wrong.

00:20:10.920 --> 00:20:12.440
It's because of people like you

00:20:12.440 --> 00:20:14.240
who don't treat others as human beings.

00:20:14.240 --> 00:20:15.840
You're the worthless trash.

00:20:20.160 --> 00:20:21.200
I'll kill you.

00:20:29.760 --> 00:20:30.600
Xu Ziqi.

00:20:30.960 --> 00:20:32.720
You beat up a civilian woman in public.

00:20:32.720 --> 00:20:35.840
According to Tang Dynasty law, you can be punished on the spot.

00:20:35.840 --> 00:20:37.280
You'll be tied up and taken to the magistrate's office.

00:20:37.280 --> 00:20:38.840
The head of Buliangren.

00:20:40.240 --> 00:20:43.040
You're nothing but a dog of the imperial court.

00:20:43.120 --> 00:20:44.380
How dare you strike me!

00:20:46.160 --> 00:20:48.090
I may be a dog of the imperial court.

00:20:48.280 --> 00:20:50.200
But you publicly assaulted a civilian woman.

00:20:50.200 --> 00:20:52.360
Then attempted to assault an imperial official.

00:20:52.360 --> 00:20:53.690
You're worse than a dog.

00:20:54.480 --> 00:20:55.400
Xu Ziqi,

00:20:55.600 --> 00:20:57.800
he's the Chamber of Commerce chairman.

00:20:59.520 --> 00:21:00.520
Stop it now!

00:21:01.120 --> 00:21:02.120
Why should I stop?

00:21:02.480 --> 00:21:04.480
I said I would beat you, and I mean it.

00:21:06.440 --> 00:21:07.200
Xu Ziqi!

00:21:07.920 --> 00:21:09.000
Stop it, Xu Ziqi!

00:21:19.720 --> 00:21:20.680
You've got guts.

00:21:21.400 --> 00:21:23.240
This is what I should do.

00:21:33.120 --> 00:21:35.520
Boss, this is the Nine-Cycle Revival Pill.

00:21:35.960 --> 00:21:38.490
Isn't it a waste to use it for external wounds?

00:21:43.160 --> 00:21:43.490
Ouch!

00:21:43.760 --> 00:21:45.160
It hurts!

00:21:45.680 --> 00:21:47.120
Am I being that rough?

00:21:47.680 --> 00:21:48.720
Ow!

00:21:50.760 --> 00:21:51.680
That hurts!

00:21:53.440 --> 00:21:55.440
I'll be gentler, just stop yelling.

00:21:56.040 --> 00:21:57.120
So clumsy.

00:22:07.400 --> 00:22:08.640
Xu Ziqi

00:22:09.440 --> 00:22:11.200
Look how miserable I am.

00:22:11.520 --> 00:22:13.980
Please don't be angry with me anymore, okay?

00:22:16.480 --> 00:22:18.140
You brought this on yourself.

00:22:18.680 --> 00:22:21.010
Do you know how much it costs to open a shop?

00:22:21.280 --> 00:22:23.120
Easy for you to say.

00:22:32.040 --> 00:22:32.640
This...

00:22:32.840 --> 00:22:33.640
All this money

00:22:33.960 --> 00:22:36.690
was collected by my Buliangren brothers for you.

00:22:37.280 --> 00:22:38.280
It's not for free.

00:22:38.360 --> 00:22:39.420
Just like you said,

00:22:39.480 --> 00:22:41.520
consider it as buying shares in your business.

00:22:41.520 --> 00:22:42.640
There's a list inside

00:22:42.640 --> 00:22:44.900
recording who contributed what amount.

00:22:49.720 --> 00:22:52.480
Xu Ziqi, I can't accept this money.

00:22:52.960 --> 00:22:54.720
I went fundraising in Guiren Street

00:22:54.720 --> 00:22:55.360
because there

00:22:55.360 --> 00:22:57.400
are all wealthy ladies and madams.

00:22:57.520 --> 00:22:58.200
These one or two taels of silver

00:22:58.200 --> 00:23:00.120
mean nothing to them.

00:23:00.440 --> 00:23:01.840
But these one or two taels

00:23:02.880 --> 00:23:05.010
are your brothers' monthly expenses.

00:23:05.920 --> 00:23:06.780
I can't take it.

00:23:07.960 --> 00:23:08.720
Besides,

00:23:09.440 --> 00:23:10.770
though you won't say it,

00:23:11.680 --> 00:23:12.520
I know that this time,

00:23:12.520 --> 00:23:14.920
after you beat up the guild elder like that,

00:23:15.200 --> 00:23:17.960
the merchant guild will surely cause trouble for you.

00:23:17.960 --> 00:23:18.840
Miss Xiaofei,

00:23:19.040 --> 00:23:20.200
please accept it.

00:23:20.360 --> 00:23:21.680
We believe in you.

00:23:22.120 --> 00:23:24.280
That's right. Who cares about the merchant guild?

00:23:24.280 --> 00:23:26.000
We've been annoyed with them for a long time.

00:23:26.000 --> 00:23:27.200
They deliberately inflate prices

00:23:27.200 --> 00:23:28.720
making life difficult for ordinary people.

00:23:28.720 --> 00:23:31.180
Exactly. This is just our monthly expenses.

00:23:31.640 --> 00:23:33.840
With your ability to extort our boss Xu,

00:23:34.120 --> 00:23:36.850
we'll get our money back in less than half a month.

00:23:38.120 --> 00:23:39.200
Just take it,

00:23:39.360 --> 00:23:41.640
or our boss won't be able to sleep night after night.

00:23:41.640 --> 00:23:43.100
Who won't be able to sleep?

00:23:47.200 --> 00:23:48.960
What are you all doing in the camp?

00:23:48.960 --> 00:23:50.200
Go out on patrol now.

00:23:50.240 --> 00:23:51.240
Are you that idle?

00:23:52.600 --> 00:23:53.200
Yes.

00:24:04.920 --> 00:24:06.520
Take this medicine with you.

00:24:06.520 --> 00:24:07.880
It's no use keeping it in the camp.

00:24:07.880 --> 00:24:08.940
It would be a waste.

00:24:09.000 --> 00:24:11.440
Apply this medicine three times a day,

00:24:12.040 --> 00:24:14.360
thickly. Don't wrap it with gauze.

00:24:14.640 --> 00:24:16.170
It needs air to heal faster.

00:24:18.120 --> 00:24:19.000
This camp

00:24:19.440 --> 00:24:21.100
is built quite impressively.

00:24:32.000 --> 00:24:34.920
Elder Xing has four broken ribs,

00:24:35.160 --> 00:24:37.440
both legs are fractured,

00:24:37.600 --> 00:24:41.880
and the hand he used to hit Hua Xiaofei is completely shattered.

00:24:42.880 --> 00:24:46.000
This Xu Ziqi is absolutely inhuman.

00:24:46.280 --> 00:24:48.200
With Xu Ziqi's martial arts skills,

00:24:48.200 --> 00:24:50.460
if he had truly wanted to kill Elder Xing,

00:24:50.720 --> 00:24:53.160
he definitely wouldn't be alive now.

00:24:53.400 --> 00:24:54.480
Xu Ziqi

00:24:54.640 --> 00:24:57.040
just wanted to get revenge for Hua Xiaofei.

00:25:00.680 --> 00:25:02.440
I've heard about Elder Xing's incident.

00:25:02.440 --> 00:25:04.520
Is there anything I can do to help?

00:25:05.240 --> 00:25:08.920
It's good that Elder Xing was taught a lesson by Xu Ziqi.

00:25:09.280 --> 00:25:11.760
He's been arrogant and disrespectful for too long.

00:25:11.760 --> 00:25:14.890
It would be beneficial if he learns to restrain himself.

00:25:16.640 --> 00:25:18.920
I called you here for another matter.

00:25:20.000 --> 00:25:23.440
Do you know where Hua Xiaofei's portrait has gone?

00:25:25.480 --> 00:25:26.280
Yes.

00:25:27.200 --> 00:25:28.440
The portrait of the flower queen.

00:25:28.440 --> 00:25:29.520
What other portrait would it be?

00:25:29.520 --> 00:25:30.680
Did you see it?

00:25:32.000 --> 00:25:33.440
The last time I saw it,

00:25:33.680 --> 00:25:36.140
it was hanging in the center of the main hall.

00:25:36.440 --> 00:25:40.200
If you hear or see where the portrait has gone,

00:25:40.280 --> 00:25:42.140
report to the guild immediately.

00:25:42.400 --> 00:25:43.960
Although she's no longer the flower queen,

00:25:43.960 --> 00:25:46.200
we're concerned someone might take the portrait

00:25:46.200 --> 00:25:47.760
and use our guild's name

00:25:47.920 --> 00:25:49.980
to do things that harm our interests.

00:25:52.040 --> 00:25:52.880
I understand.

00:25:55.200 --> 00:25:56.260
Respected Elders,

00:25:57.200 --> 00:25:58.120
I humbly dare

00:25:58.520 --> 00:25:59.720
to plead for Xu Ziqi.

00:26:03.360 --> 00:26:05.220
What Xu Ziqi did was indeed wrong.

00:26:06.040 --> 00:26:08.760
I will make sure he apologizes to Elder Xing with proper contrition.

00:26:08.760 --> 00:26:11.840
Elder Xing was indeed in the wrong first.

00:26:12.040 --> 00:26:13.100
It doesn't matter.

00:26:13.160 --> 00:26:15.220
But Fang Lihen, have you ever thought

00:26:15.640 --> 00:26:17.840
when Xu Ziqi was beating Elder Xing,

00:26:18.200 --> 00:26:20.360
did he consider you at all?

00:26:25.920 --> 00:26:26.720
Xu Ziqi.

00:26:27.480 --> 00:26:29.520
You asked me to give you time

00:26:29.520 --> 00:26:30.980
to investigate the truth.

00:26:31.520 --> 00:26:33.520
Yet you acted recklessly yourself.

00:26:34.000 --> 00:26:36.000
Where exactly have you placed

00:26:36.000 --> 00:26:38.260
the trust that I and the court have in you?

00:26:38.720 --> 00:26:40.050
I did assault Elder Xing

00:26:40.400 --> 00:26:42.330
partly out of personal vengeance.

00:26:42.600 --> 00:26:43.660
But that Elder Xing

00:26:43.720 --> 00:26:46.450
beat Hua Xiaofei, a defenseless woman, in public

00:26:46.640 --> 00:26:48.500
until she was covered in bruises.

00:26:49.960 --> 00:26:52.090
I am willing to accept any punishment.

00:26:52.280 --> 00:26:55.120
So you beat Elder Xing until he was severely injured.

00:26:55.120 --> 00:26:58.000
Now the Chamber of Commerce demands severe punishment for you.

00:26:58.000 --> 00:26:59.680
What am I supposed to do?

00:27:05.680 --> 00:27:06.480
Tomorrow,

00:27:07.640 --> 00:27:10.960
I will have you dismissed from office and investigated.

00:27:11.680 --> 00:27:13.040
And publicly announce

00:27:13.240 --> 00:27:16.570
that you will never be allowed to serve as an official again.

00:27:17.920 --> 00:27:20.450
I will follow Your Highness's arrangements.

00:27:22.280 --> 00:27:23.240
I understand.

00:27:23.720 --> 00:27:24.760
After my dismissal,

00:27:24.760 --> 00:27:27.240
the Chamber of Commerce will surely lower their guard.

00:27:27.240 --> 00:27:28.880
Without my official position,

00:27:28.880 --> 00:27:31.640
many things will be easier to accomplish,

00:27:31.960 --> 00:27:33.280
and I won't burden the court.

00:27:33.280 --> 00:27:34.120
Master Xu,

00:27:34.680 --> 00:27:37.740
I hope you understand Her Highness's good intentions.

00:27:37.960 --> 00:27:39.420
Her Highness is doing this

00:27:40.760 --> 00:27:42.480
to protect you as well.

00:27:44.040 --> 00:27:44.960
I understand.

00:27:49.000 --> 00:27:50.960
Let me tell you about my shop in detail.

00:27:50.960 --> 00:27:53.160
We focus on affordable beauty products

00:27:53.480 --> 00:27:55.680
and frequently updated items.

00:27:55.920 --> 00:27:56.920
They're not only effective

00:27:56.920 --> 00:27:59.600
but affordable for all girls.

00:28:06.040 --> 00:28:09.040
It's hard to stay enthusiastic when you're like this.

00:28:10.680 --> 00:28:12.810
All these things you're talking about

00:28:13.120 --> 00:28:14.580
have nothing to do with me.

00:28:14.960 --> 00:28:17.360
I only use custom-made products from Hero.

00:28:17.960 --> 00:28:20.240
And don't think I don't know

00:28:20.920 --> 00:28:23.040
that you're challenging the Chamber of Commerce.

00:28:23.040 --> 00:28:26.160
Why should we offend the Chamber of Commerce for your sake?

00:28:26.160 --> 00:28:29.200
I'm not asking you to use the beauty products I developed.

00:28:29.200 --> 00:28:32.400
I think we can join forces.

00:28:33.160 --> 00:28:35.640
With my and Yingxiong's skills, we can create good products.

00:28:35.640 --> 00:28:38.720
And you would be our walking advertisement,

00:28:39.120 --> 00:28:40.520
promoting the products.

00:28:40.520 --> 00:28:43.040
Zhang Guicai's transport network can open up the market.

00:28:43.040 --> 00:28:45.120
No matter how good the Chamber of Commerce is at business,

00:28:45.120 --> 00:28:47.480
they only consider the officials and nobles.

00:28:47.480 --> 00:28:49.920
How many officials and nobles are there in the Tang Dynasty?

00:28:49.920 --> 00:28:52.120
And how many ordinary people are there?

00:28:52.280 --> 00:28:55.000
This is an untapped market!

00:28:56.640 --> 00:28:58.360
I sell one box of Yingyan cosmetics

00:28:58.360 --> 00:28:59.960
and earn several taels of silver.

00:28:59.960 --> 00:29:01.960
How much can you earn from one box?

00:29:03.280 --> 00:29:05.880
The girls who buy my products

00:29:06.720 --> 00:29:09.380
can probably only afford a few strings of coins.

00:29:10.600 --> 00:29:11.440
But if one box sells for three strings of coins...

00:29:11.440 --> 00:29:13.500
How much would a hundred boxes bring?

00:29:14.360 --> 00:29:15.620
Three taels of silver.

00:29:15.680 --> 00:29:17.840
I've done a survey of the girls in Chang'an.

00:29:17.840 --> 00:29:19.200
There are 500,000 of them.

00:29:19.200 --> 00:29:20.360
Even if only one person

00:29:20.360 --> 00:29:22.290
out of a hundred buys my cosmetics,

00:29:22.680 --> 00:29:24.010
how many people is that?

00:29:24.160 --> 00:29:25.120
5,000 people.

00:29:25.440 --> 00:29:27.200
And how much money is that?

00:29:29.200 --> 00:29:30.440
150 taels.

00:29:57.480 --> 00:29:59.120
The new beauty brand jointly founded by me, Hua Xiaofei,

00:29:59.120 --> 00:29:59.880
Gu Jin'er,

00:29:59.960 --> 00:30:00.880
Zhang Guicai,

00:30:01.000 --> 00:30:01.800
and Yingxiong

00:30:01.840 --> 00:30:04.360
is officially

00:30:04.440 --> 00:30:06.920
opening for business today.

00:30:10.440 --> 00:30:10.640
[Brand]

00:30:10.640 --> 00:30:10.960
One, two, three.

00:30:10.960 --> 00:30:11.820
One, two, pack.

00:30:16.280 --> 00:30:16.960
Over here.

00:30:20.760 --> 00:30:21.840
Hey, Hua Xiaofei,

00:30:22.240 --> 00:30:25.040
can't you hire more people to plant these flowers?

00:30:25.440 --> 00:30:26.160
Yeah.

00:30:27.280 --> 00:30:29.280
Where would I get the money, my dear?

00:30:29.960 --> 00:30:32.640
We only raised 70 taels

00:30:32.960 --> 00:30:34.160
and it's all gone.

00:30:37.840 --> 00:30:39.160
Let's take a break.

00:30:41.920 --> 00:30:42.440
Boss.

00:30:42.680 --> 00:30:45.400
I saw Miss Xiaofei with Zhang Guicai and others

00:30:45.440 --> 00:30:47.170
planting flowers in the field.

00:30:48.600 --> 00:30:49.440
Is that so?

00:30:49.480 --> 00:30:49.920
Yes.

00:30:52.920 --> 00:30:54.780
Hurry up. Get everyone together.

00:30:54.960 --> 00:30:55.490
Yes, sir.

00:30:59.840 --> 00:31:00.640
Today,

00:31:00.720 --> 00:31:03.160
all our patrol duties are finished.

00:31:03.480 --> 00:31:04.520
So,

00:31:04.760 --> 00:31:06.360
we're going on an outing.

00:31:06.400 --> 00:31:07.680
Great!

00:31:11.280 --> 00:31:12.600
It's been so long since we went out.

00:31:12.600 --> 00:31:14.440
It's been too long since we had a break.

00:31:14.440 --> 00:31:16.770
Today, we won't go home until we're drunk.

00:31:22.280 --> 00:31:25.000
This area has been requisitioned by us, the Buluoren.

00:31:25.000 --> 00:31:28.130
All unauthorized personnel must wait outside the rope.

00:31:35.640 --> 00:31:37.370
What's going on with these two?

00:31:37.440 --> 00:31:38.500
Are they fighting?

00:31:39.040 --> 00:31:39.880
Seems like it.

00:31:40.680 --> 00:31:42.080
Look at Master Xu's eyes.

00:31:42.120 --> 00:31:45.250
If he rolls them any further, they'll reach the heavens.

00:31:48.360 --> 00:31:50.640
What's wrong with Xiao Fei and Brother Xu's eyes?

00:31:50.640 --> 00:31:51.400
Did they catch an eye disease?

00:31:51.400 --> 00:31:53.400
Weren't they just fine a moment ago?

00:31:56.040 --> 00:31:57.840
We need to search over there too.

00:31:57.960 --> 00:31:59.480
You, go search there.

00:32:04.440 --> 00:32:05.770
They're quite capable.

00:32:06.840 --> 00:32:07.640
Indeed.

00:32:19.040 --> 00:32:19.840
Come.

00:32:22.120 --> 00:32:23.440
Boss, we've finished planting.

00:32:23.440 --> 00:32:24.840
Everyone has assembled.

00:32:28.400 --> 00:32:30.200
Thank you all for your hard work.

00:32:30.720 --> 00:32:31.840
Today's outing

00:32:32.120 --> 00:32:33.120
ends here.

00:32:33.920 --> 00:32:35.180
You can all go back now.

00:32:36.600 --> 00:32:37.400
Go home.

00:32:49.200 --> 00:32:49.960
I don't know

00:32:50.640 --> 00:32:51.720
if after today

00:32:52.640 --> 00:32:54.360
I'll still be able to help you.

00:33:33.960 --> 00:33:34.640
Like this.

00:33:35.360 --> 00:33:36.820
It's perfectly straight.

00:33:41.360 --> 00:33:42.620
It looks a bit crooked.

00:33:45.040 --> 00:33:46.300
Isn't it a bit crooked?

00:33:49.360 --> 00:33:51.090
I just felt it wasn't straight.

00:33:51.640 --> 00:33:52.570
Let's try again.

00:33:54.400 --> 00:33:56.730
Can't even put this up properly. Strange.

00:33:57.440 --> 00:33:59.440
I was just passing by to check on things.

00:33:59.440 --> 00:34:00.680
Wishing you a prosperous opening

00:34:00.680 --> 00:34:01.680
and all the best.

00:34:02.120 --> 00:34:03.120
I'll be going now.

00:34:04.000 --> 00:34:05.200
Take care, Master Xu.

00:34:13.639 --> 00:34:14.920
What are you doing?

00:34:17.920 --> 00:34:19.250
I'll go help over there.

00:34:20.320 --> 00:34:21.120
Miss Xiaofei.

00:34:22.239 --> 00:34:22.960
Miss Yang.

00:34:23.040 --> 00:34:23.969
What's going on?

00:34:24.360 --> 00:34:26.760
Smooth opening. Good fortune at all times.

00:34:29.040 --> 00:34:29.960
Miss Yang,

00:34:30.719 --> 00:34:31.920
what brings you here?

00:34:32.000 --> 00:34:34.400
Why don't we sit down and catch up?

00:34:34.560 --> 00:34:35.159
Sure.

00:34:35.320 --> 00:34:37.320
I was hoping to have a chat with you, Miss Xiaofei.

00:34:37.320 --> 00:34:37.920
Alright.

00:34:44.840 --> 00:34:45.600
Let go.

00:34:55.880 --> 00:34:57.880
By the way, what were you talking about earlier?

00:34:57.880 --> 00:34:59.440
About Master Xu, of course.

00:34:59.800 --> 00:35:02.240
I've arranged an outing with Master Xu.

00:35:02.600 --> 00:35:04.520
I wonder if Miss Xiaofei minds.

00:35:08.640 --> 00:35:09.960
I don't mind.

00:35:10.080 --> 00:35:11.740
Feel free to go find Master Xu.

00:35:12.000 --> 00:35:14.000
Miss Xiaofei, you truly don't mind

00:35:14.000 --> 00:35:16.200
that I'm going out alone with Master Xu?

00:35:17.160 --> 00:35:18.480
Could it be

00:35:19.160 --> 00:35:22.400
that Miss Xiaofei's affections aren't for Master Xu?

00:35:27.560 --> 00:35:29.090
Master Xu isn't here today.

00:35:29.800 --> 00:35:32.130
Perhaps Miss Xiaofei could speak freely,

00:35:32.320 --> 00:35:34.880
so I can understand the whole situation.

00:35:36.480 --> 00:35:37.440
I like men

00:35:38.120 --> 00:35:41.320
with money and power.

00:35:41.600 --> 00:35:42.520
Xu Ziqi...

00:35:43.400 --> 00:35:44.560
No, no.

00:35:44.920 --> 00:35:48.080
But Master Xu is chivalrous and righteous,

00:35:48.520 --> 00:35:49.850
truly a legendary hero.

00:35:52.000 --> 00:35:54.360
What matters is everyday life.

00:35:54.720 --> 00:35:56.520
Can reputation be eaten as food?

00:35:56.880 --> 00:35:58.880
Can martial arts skills be spent as money?

00:35:58.880 --> 00:36:02.440
I never expected Miss Xiaofei to be so calculating.

00:36:03.600 --> 00:36:04.760
You flatter me.

00:36:11.360 --> 00:36:12.820
Hello, Young Master Fang.

00:36:15.080 --> 00:36:15.560
Father.

00:36:16.040 --> 00:36:16.520
Debiao.

00:36:17.040 --> 00:36:17.880
You're here too.

00:36:17.880 --> 00:36:18.440
Yes.

00:36:19.280 --> 00:36:22.340
I heard a former top courtesan was setting up shop here.

00:36:25.240 --> 00:36:26.700
I thought it was Gu Jin'er.

00:36:28.280 --> 00:36:29.240
Why are you here too,

00:36:29.240 --> 00:36:30.000
Hua Xiaofei?

00:36:30.600 --> 00:36:32.960
I convinced Jin'er to open a shop with me.

00:36:34.000 --> 00:36:35.040
It was all my idea.

00:36:35.840 --> 00:36:37.760
I was planning to find a suitable opportunity

00:36:37.760 --> 00:36:39.020
to tell you about this.

00:36:39.040 --> 00:36:39.960
I didn't expect

00:36:40.840 --> 00:36:42.440
you'd come looking today.

00:36:42.560 --> 00:36:44.490
Have you registered as a merchant?

00:36:44.520 --> 00:36:45.120
Yes.

00:36:45.880 --> 00:36:47.340
Did you consider me at all?

00:36:47.800 --> 00:36:49.920
Did you think about me even for a moment?

00:36:49.920 --> 00:36:50.800
How can I,

00:36:50.920 --> 00:36:53.450
Fang Lihen, ever show my face in public again?

00:36:53.920 --> 00:36:54.880
Fang Lihen.

00:36:55.320 --> 00:36:56.040
You are you,

00:36:56.160 --> 00:36:56.960
and I am me.

00:36:57.160 --> 00:36:59.480
My becoming a merchant has nothing to do with you.

00:36:59.480 --> 00:37:00.680
Nothing to do with me?

00:37:01.160 --> 00:37:02.360
Everyone in Chang'an knows

00:37:02.360 --> 00:37:04.020
I've already proposed to you.

00:37:04.040 --> 00:37:06.170
How can this have nothing to do with me?

00:37:07.560 --> 00:37:09.560
Fang Lihen, I'm sorry.

00:37:09.960 --> 00:37:11.640
I must do this.

00:37:13.960 --> 00:37:16.440
The person I love is against the Merchants' Guild.

00:37:16.440 --> 00:37:19.170
My good brother has badly beaten the Guild Elder.

00:37:19.720 --> 00:37:20.480
Why?

00:37:21.040 --> 00:37:23.040
Why didn't you consider me at all?

00:37:23.520 --> 00:37:25.520
If you really insist on becoming a merchant,

00:37:25.520 --> 00:37:26.920
no one can protect you.

00:37:27.320 --> 00:37:30.120
Xu Ziqi has already been dismissed because of you.

00:37:32.360 --> 00:37:33.600
Xu Ziqi?

00:37:36.000 --> 00:37:37.080
What happened to him?

00:37:37.080 --> 00:37:39.210
Xu Ziqi publicly beat the Guild Elder.

00:37:39.320 --> 00:37:42.050
He's been dismissed and is under investigation.

00:37:44.040 --> 00:37:46.440
Xu Ziqi, were you really dismissed?

00:37:51.160 --> 00:37:52.080
Master Xu.

00:37:52.240 --> 00:37:52.700
This...

00:37:53.400 --> 00:37:54.480
I was wondering...

00:37:54.720 --> 00:37:57.780
You usually wear Buliangren uniform when patrolling.

00:37:58.720 --> 00:38:01.040
So it's true, isn't it?

00:38:02.240 --> 00:38:04.240
Dismissed from Buliangren service

00:38:04.480 --> 00:38:07.010
and banned from official positions forever.

00:38:07.480 --> 00:38:09.920
Your future husband holds a high position

00:38:09.960 --> 00:38:11.160
and great authority.

00:38:13.160 --> 00:38:15.890
Never allowed to hold official positions again.

00:38:17.440 --> 00:38:18.480
Xu Ziqi.

00:38:19.400 --> 00:38:21.280
So this means that you

00:38:22.040 --> 00:38:24.500
can never hold an important position again.

00:38:26.960 --> 00:38:29.000
I used to think all those things you said

00:38:29.000 --> 00:38:30.640
were just jokes.

00:38:31.320 --> 00:38:33.780
Now I've really been demoted and dismissed.

00:38:34.280 --> 00:38:37.000
You don't even care how I'll make a living.

00:38:37.400 --> 00:38:39.480
Second, you don't care what happens to me.

00:38:39.480 --> 00:38:41.610
You only care if I can keep my position.

00:38:41.920 --> 00:38:42.440
I...

00:38:42.840 --> 00:38:43.560
Xu Ziqi...

00:38:43.960 --> 00:38:45.290
That's not what I meant.

00:38:45.520 --> 00:38:46.760
Miss Xiaofei,

00:38:47.400 --> 00:38:48.760
so what you just said

00:38:49.240 --> 00:38:50.440
was actually true.

00:38:51.360 --> 00:38:51.960
I...

00:39:17.120 --> 00:39:19.380
I know you have feelings for Hua Xiaofei.

00:39:20.240 --> 00:39:21.970
Now I'm giving you two options.

00:39:22.320 --> 00:39:25.580
First, Hua Xiaofei surrenders to the chamber of commerce,

00:39:25.720 --> 00:39:27.880
and we'll let bygones be bygones.

00:39:28.360 --> 00:39:29.120
Second,

00:39:29.440 --> 00:39:31.400
Hua Xiaofei will no longer pose

00:39:31.400 --> 00:39:32.960
any threat to the guild.

00:39:34.000 --> 00:39:35.720
By 'no threat,' you mean...

00:39:36.320 --> 00:39:37.640
She'll disappear.

00:39:39.720 --> 00:39:41.120
Please give me some time.

00:39:41.640 --> 00:39:44.080
I will make Xiaofei surrender to the guild.

00:39:45.520 --> 00:39:46.360
Xiaofei,

00:39:47.360 --> 00:39:50.090
when will you understand my difficult position?

00:39:59.960 --> 00:40:00.560
Sir,

00:40:04.720 --> 00:40:06.120
It's cold in late autumn.

00:40:06.240 --> 00:40:07.360
Don't catch a chill.

00:40:07.360 --> 00:40:10.160
You have many matters waiting for your attention.

00:40:10.160 --> 00:40:10.720
Yang Lin.

00:40:11.280 --> 00:40:12.160
Elder Yi

00:40:12.640 --> 00:40:13.700
wants us to pretend

00:40:14.240 --> 00:40:15.970
to support Xiaofei's business

00:40:16.560 --> 00:40:20.040
in order to bring her shop into the guild.

00:40:22.080 --> 00:40:24.440
If I don't follow the Elder's instructions,

00:40:24.440 --> 00:40:25.240
Xiaofei

00:40:25.720 --> 00:40:27.050
may be in mortal danger.

00:40:30.440 --> 00:40:32.100
This matter cannot be defied.

00:40:32.920 --> 00:40:35.240
You have no other choice, sir.

00:40:36.000 --> 00:40:38.040
Xiaofei's entry into the merchant registry

00:40:38.040 --> 00:40:39.770
is something I deeply despise.

00:40:40.000 --> 00:40:40.600
Now

00:40:42.280 --> 00:40:44.210
I can only follow the guild's lead.

00:40:44.960 --> 00:40:46.490
Xiaofei's merchant status

00:40:46.720 --> 00:40:48.000
can never be removed.

00:40:48.760 --> 00:40:49.400
Sir,

00:40:50.440 --> 00:40:53.960
although without an imperial decree her status cannot be changed,

00:40:53.960 --> 00:40:54.800
but

00:40:55.040 --> 00:40:56.120
I can see that Xiaofei

00:40:56.120 --> 00:40:58.280
sincerely wants to run this shop.

00:40:58.560 --> 00:41:00.960
Perhaps you could help Miss Xiaofei,

00:41:02.160 --> 00:41:04.760
but it's best not to expect anything in return.

00:41:06.240 --> 00:41:08.240
If there's no reward for doing this,

00:41:08.520 --> 00:41:09.780
then why should I do it?

00:41:14.960 --> 00:41:16.440
Xu Ziqi acts recklessly.

00:41:17.600 --> 00:41:19.800
I really don't know what he's thinking.

00:41:20.720 --> 00:41:22.450
Everything Xiaofei wants now,

00:41:22.840 --> 00:41:24.370
he cannot provide any of it.

00:41:25.320 --> 00:41:26.980
But I can give her everything.

00:41:28.720 --> 00:41:29.320
All I want

00:41:31.000 --> 00:41:32.280
is her heart.

00:41:37.640 --> 00:41:39.440
Why are all these flowers white?

00:41:40.040 --> 00:41:42.240
Xiaofei bought several kinds of seeds.

00:41:43.520 --> 00:41:45.960
I'm afraid when the workers were planting,

00:41:46.120 --> 00:41:47.580
they took the wrong seeds.

00:41:48.360 --> 00:41:51.000
How can we make colored cosmetics with so many white flowers?

00:41:51.000 --> 00:41:52.600
These... these are useless.

00:41:53.440 --> 00:41:56.080
Months of hard work wasted.

00:42:18.120 --> 00:42:20.040
Never to be admitted to official service again.

00:42:20.040 --> 00:42:22.560
Your future husband holds high position and great power,

00:42:22.560 --> 00:42:23.800
has immense wealth,

00:42:23.880 --> 00:42:26.440
is virtuous and exceptionally handsome.

00:42:27.240 --> 00:42:29.300
You know that I have feelings for you,

00:42:29.840 --> 00:42:30.880
don't you?

00:42:31.560 --> 00:42:33.400
You must make the right choice.

00:42:33.400 --> 00:42:35.730
Otherwise, it will cause a chain reaction

00:42:36.120 --> 00:42:38.280
affecting many people.

00:42:46.160 --> 00:42:46.760
Xiaofei.

00:42:59.840 --> 00:43:00.600
Fang Lihen.

00:43:01.120 --> 00:43:03.520
I don't want to talk about Shang Ji with you.

00:43:03.640 --> 00:43:04.900
If you want to scold me,

00:43:05.080 --> 00:43:05.880
do it another day.

00:43:05.880 --> 00:43:06.640
Wait.

00:43:07.520 --> 00:43:10.120
These idiots can't even plant flowers correctly.

00:43:10.120 --> 00:43:12.520
They're good for nothing except fighting.

00:43:22.800 --> 00:43:23.720
What's this?

00:43:24.600 --> 00:43:26.600
This is a gift for you.

00:43:27.440 --> 00:43:28.280
A gift.

00:43:30.600 --> 00:43:33.120
Xiaowei, I've heard about the flowers.

00:43:33.120 --> 00:43:35.520
I'll ask my men to plant new ones right away.

00:43:36.840 --> 00:43:37.480
Xu.

00:43:37.960 --> 00:43:39.360
The flowers take 15 days to bloom.

00:43:39.360 --> 00:43:41.000
And another 15 days to process.

00:43:41.000 --> 00:43:42.200
That's a whole month.

00:43:42.480 --> 00:43:44.210
How can Xiaowei wait that long?

00:43:44.320 --> 00:43:45.080
Besides,

00:43:45.600 --> 00:43:48.080
you're no longer the leader of the Buliang men.

00:43:48.080 --> 00:43:48.720
How can you

00:43:48.720 --> 00:43:50.640
trouble your former brothers again?

00:43:50.640 --> 00:43:51.440
Xiaowei.

00:43:51.960 --> 00:43:53.020
If you just say yes,

00:43:53.880 --> 00:43:55.880
if you want to run a stable business,

00:43:55.960 --> 00:43:58.040
I will do everything I can to help you.

00:43:58.120 --> 00:44:00.800
Xiaowei, your shop's operating costs...

00:44:01.280 --> 00:44:03.560
You can't afford to wait another 15 days.

00:44:09.040 --> 00:44:09.880
Xiaowei.

00:44:10.440 --> 00:44:11.600
I have some silver here.

00:44:11.600 --> 00:44:12.960
Take it for now to help you through.

00:44:12.960 --> 00:44:13.960
When I get home,

00:44:13.960 --> 00:44:15.840
I'll immediately pawn some antiques.

00:44:15.840 --> 00:44:17.500
We'll find the money somehow.

00:44:19.920 --> 00:44:20.960
It's just money.

00:44:21.560 --> 00:44:22.420
I'll pay for it.

00:44:22.600 --> 00:44:24.440
We can't let Xu pay again.

00:44:36.120 --> 00:44:37.040
This gold

00:44:37.400 --> 00:44:39.520
will be enough for you to get by for a year.

00:44:39.520 --> 00:44:40.980
You'll have plenty of time

00:44:41.000 --> 00:44:42.530
to grow the flowers you want

00:44:42.640 --> 00:44:45.080
and develop the products you want to launch.

00:44:45.080 --> 00:44:47.210
Even if the business doesn't succeed,

00:44:47.400 --> 00:44:49.930
as long as you're happy, that's what matters.

00:44:54.320 --> 00:44:55.920
Xiaofei, before

00:44:56.280 --> 00:44:57.400
I was selfish and arbitrary,

00:44:57.400 --> 00:45:00.600
thinking you started your business to challenge the guild.

00:45:00.600 --> 00:45:01.800
After careful reflection,

00:45:01.800 --> 00:45:02.860
on the opening day,

00:45:02.960 --> 00:45:04.420
you were genuinely happy.

00:45:04.960 --> 00:45:06.080
I finally realized

00:45:06.400 --> 00:45:07.240
that joining the guild

00:45:07.240 --> 00:45:09.520
was what you truly wanted to do.

00:45:10.280 --> 00:45:11.040
Xiaofei.

00:45:12.240 --> 00:45:13.240
I want to help you.

00:45:14.840 --> 00:45:15.600
Hua Xiaofei.

00:45:16.760 --> 00:45:18.280
Remember what you said before.

00:45:18.280 --> 00:45:19.320
Don't forget it.

00:45:20.160 --> 00:45:20.960
You said

00:45:21.080 --> 00:45:22.040
you would never again be involved in

00:45:22.040 --> 00:45:24.440
the chamber's harmful business dealings.

00:45:24.920 --> 00:45:25.720
Xu,

00:45:26.120 --> 00:45:27.520
that's not appropriate.

00:45:27.600 --> 00:45:29.600
This isn't the chamber's business.

00:45:29.720 --> 00:45:31.320
It's Xiaofei's life's work.

00:45:37.240 --> 00:45:38.040
Zhang Guicai.

00:45:38.560 --> 00:45:40.280
I can't take your money.

00:45:40.720 --> 00:45:43.560
I really don't want Jin to feel indebted to you.

00:45:44.160 --> 00:45:46.890
After all, this is something we all did together.

00:45:49.360 --> 00:45:51.880
Xu Ziqi, you've done too much for me.

00:45:52.400 --> 00:45:53.800
I don't want you to

00:45:54.320 --> 00:45:56.580
pawn your treasured possessions for me.

00:45:56.640 --> 00:45:57.960
I also don't want you

00:45:58.040 --> 00:46:00.440
to give up doing what you love because of me.

00:46:00.520 --> 00:46:02.360
Xiaofei, it's okay.

00:46:03.240 --> 00:46:05.160
But the pressure is too much.

00:46:05.960 --> 00:46:07.320
You're too good to me.

00:46:08.080 --> 00:46:09.480
I really can't repay you.

00:46:12.840 --> 00:46:13.600
Fang Lihen.

00:46:14.440 --> 00:46:16.960
I accept your financial support and the shop.

00:46:16.960 --> 00:46:19.440
Xiaofei, you and I are one.

00:46:26.280 --> 00:46:26.880
Mr. Xu.

00:46:27.360 --> 00:46:28.020
Officer Xu.

00:46:33.640 --> 00:46:34.900
Take care, Officer Xu.

00:46:46.360 --> 00:46:48.440
No, we are not one.

00:46:48.720 --> 00:46:51.120
We have a written agreement.

00:46:51.560 --> 00:46:53.440
I accepted your financial support

00:46:53.440 --> 00:46:54.720
because this business

00:46:55.400 --> 00:46:56.360
is Jin'er's

00:46:56.440 --> 00:46:59.320
and Yingxiong's livelihood for the rest of their lives.

00:46:59.320 --> 00:47:01.180
I can't let them lose everything.

00:47:01.960 --> 00:47:03.360
I'll pay you back as soon as possible.

00:47:03.360 --> 00:47:05.320
Xiaofei, there's no rush for any of this.

00:47:05.320 --> 00:47:06.760
I'm leaving now.
