00:00:00.910 --> 00:00:04.440
This is a video the witness sent us.
I sent it to you. Check it out.

00:00:04.780 --> 00:00:07.080
I think the guy with the scar
on his face is the culprit.

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:18.560
Hey, watch your driving!

00:00:19.090 --> 00:00:21.330
- Are you trying to kill someone?
- I'm sorry.

00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:22.930
I'm sorry.

00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:26.200
Boss, I took the banner down properly.

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:30.100
Right. I'll make sure
I don't leave any traces.

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:35.170
Unfortunately,

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:38.580
the dashcam didn't capture him
taking down the banner.

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:42.180
But according to the witness
who sent the video,

00:00:42.710 --> 00:00:46.150
the witness definitely saw the man
with the scar taking down the banner.

00:00:46.550 --> 00:00:47.550
Really?

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:50.690
Then it really does sound
like he's our guy.

00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:53.320
And what a scar on his face...

00:01:02.970 --> 00:01:04.670
When did you get here?

00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:07.410
Just now.

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:11.610
You're with CEO Chae
from the Dream Hotel...

00:01:11.980 --> 00:01:12.980
Yes.

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:15.250
I'm Director Lee Kang Hyuk.

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:18.580
Right. Hello.

00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:19.880
It seems...

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:23.020
I've interrupted something.

00:01:23.020 --> 00:01:27.160
Well, we're looking for a suspect.

00:01:28.330 --> 00:01:29.330
A suspect?

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:32.160
Yes, it's just something we're working on.

00:01:32.860 --> 00:01:35.500
So, what brings you here?

00:01:35.830 --> 00:01:36.840
Oh, yes.

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:40.140
CEO Chae would like to speak
with you, Ms. Oh.

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:42.740
She wants to see me?

00:01:47.350 --> 00:01:50.520
What? What do you mean, there's a video
of the banner being taken down?

00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:54.320
I don't know
how Oh Jang Mi got that video.

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:58.090
What do you mean you don't know?
How could you be so careless?

00:01:58.720 --> 00:01:59.760
I'm sorry.

00:02:01.060 --> 00:02:03.430
And to make matters worse,
your man, Ssangkal or whatever,

00:02:03.900 --> 00:02:05.830
had his face caught on the dashcam?

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:11.640
How can these cockroaches
be so relentless?

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:12.970
They just won't quit.

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:16.510
We have to stop them. Whatever it takes.

00:02:17.210 --> 00:02:20.310
If that video contains definitive proof,

00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:24.120
it's only a matter of time
before they find out what we did.

00:02:24.350 --> 00:02:26.620
I'm sorry. I will put a stop to it myself.

00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:30.420
I will ensure this doesn't affect you.
Please do not worry.

00:02:30.490 --> 00:02:32.060
How can I not worry? How?

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:36.660
Not when they could be coming
for my throat at any moment.

00:02:36.730 --> 00:02:37.830
What are you talking about?

00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:42.630
Who's coming for your throat, Mom?

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:45.970
Who do you think?
Yeom San Wol and Jin Hong Ju.

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:50.170
This is no time for you
to be casually dropping by my office.

00:02:50.610 --> 00:02:53.110
That shameless mother-daughter duo
is cozying up to the Chairman,

00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:56.010
and they're hell-bent
on stealing your position.

00:02:56.080 --> 00:02:58.180
Enough with the nagging.

00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:06.790
- That feels great.
- Does that feel good?

00:03:06.860 --> 00:03:09.430
- Yes. And right here.
- Right here.

00:03:09.490 --> 00:03:11.760
That feels great.

00:03:11.830 --> 00:03:14.500
I have magic hands, don't I, Chairman?

00:03:15.070 --> 00:03:19.700
For all those years, I was always the one
who massaged CEO Chae's shoulders.

00:03:19.770 --> 00:03:21.640
Really?

00:03:22.740 --> 00:03:24.380
That really hits the spot.

00:03:29.150 --> 00:03:31.150
Look at that vixen,
putting on a show again.

00:03:31.980 --> 00:03:34.920
She's no different from me,
just another servant.

00:03:35.350 --> 00:03:37.590
But she's desperately trying
to claw her way to the top.

00:03:39.790 --> 00:03:40.790
You startled me!

00:03:42.630 --> 00:03:45.430
What are you doing skulking around
and eavesdropping?

00:03:45.500 --> 00:03:47.300
Eavesdropping? Who's eavesdropping?

00:03:47.600 --> 00:03:49.930
I brought some pumpkin porridge
for the Chairman.

00:03:50.470 --> 00:03:53.910
Good. Bring it here.

00:04:01.350 --> 00:04:02.680
Pumpkin porridge.

00:04:10.760 --> 00:04:11.760
Chairman.

00:04:12.360 --> 00:04:15.930
- I'm so humiliated I could just die.
- Why's that?

00:04:15.960 --> 00:04:19.130
Now that I'm living here under your roof,

00:04:19.400 --> 00:04:23.430
even the staff here treats me like dirt.

00:04:23.840 --> 00:04:28.040
Just look. She only brought porridge
for you.

00:04:28.210 --> 00:04:31.880
Even though she knew I was here,
she left me out completely.

00:04:32.140 --> 00:04:33.280
I get hungry too, you know.

00:04:33.950 --> 00:04:35.110
For goodness' sake.

00:04:35.380 --> 00:04:37.850
Come on, don't get upset
over something like that.

00:04:38.250 --> 00:04:41.390
There, there. All right.

00:04:42.550 --> 00:04:43.790
Here. Try this.

00:04:44.620 --> 00:04:45.620
Oh my.

00:04:46.390 --> 00:04:48.090
- Come on, eat up.
- Okay.

00:04:49.330 --> 00:04:51.030
There. Isn't that better?

00:04:51.830 --> 00:04:53.300
I think Mrs. Yang brought
only one spoon on purpose...

00:04:53.300 --> 00:04:55.300
so we'd share the pumpkin porridge.

00:04:55.470 --> 00:04:56.830
There's nothing
to get so worked up about, right?

00:04:57.270 --> 00:04:58.340
You think so?

00:04:58.340 --> 00:05:00.410
Then you should have some too, Chairman.

00:05:01.110 --> 00:05:02.110
Me?

00:05:03.510 --> 00:05:04.510
There you go.

00:05:05.510 --> 00:05:06.740
Somehow, this tastes even better.

00:05:11.450 --> 00:05:14.420
He looks so disgusting.

00:05:15.790 --> 00:05:17.420
Come on, I said I'll take you.

00:05:17.490 --> 00:05:21.490
No, it's okay. I'm meeting CEO Chae.
Why would you come? I can go by myself.

00:05:21.660 --> 00:05:25.400
But the thing is, the dashcam footage
doesn't show the guy removing the banner.

00:05:25.700 --> 00:05:26.800
Tell me about it.

00:05:27.200 --> 00:05:30.230
It's too bad that without that footage,
it isn't the smoking gun we need.

00:05:30.400 --> 00:05:33.500
Our top priority is finding the man
with the scar on his face.

00:05:34.140 --> 00:05:35.170
I'm heading out.

00:05:35.470 --> 00:05:37.880
- All right, be safe.
- Okay.

00:05:38.380 --> 00:05:40.710
Let me know why
CEO Chae wanted to see you.

00:05:50.420 --> 00:05:53.690
First, I have to see
if there's any concrete evidence...

00:05:53.960 --> 00:05:55.430
in the video.

00:05:57.730 --> 00:06:00.630
I was wondering why you wanted to see me.

00:06:01.130 --> 00:06:03.500
Did I do something wrong, ma'am?

00:06:04.300 --> 00:06:06.800
A mistake? No, of course not.

00:06:07.810 --> 00:06:09.910
The reason I asked to see you is...

00:06:12.740 --> 00:06:15.080
I just have to take this call.
I'll be right back.

00:06:32.160 --> 00:06:35.070
That's right.
You'd better do that, Oh Jang Mi.

00:06:35.830 --> 00:06:37.600
Have you met with our CEO?

00:06:38.240 --> 00:06:39.600
Just texting to confirm.

00:06:39.940 --> 00:06:42.070
Yes, I'm with her now.

00:06:47.780 --> 00:06:49.910
I'm so sorry. I call you in
and then act all busy...

00:06:51.380 --> 00:06:53.720
Oh my gosh, what do I do? Oh no!

00:06:54.290 --> 00:06:55.290
I'm so sorry.

00:06:55.550 --> 00:06:56.550
It's all right.

00:06:56.550 --> 00:06:59.160
It's not all right.
You must clean it up now,

00:06:59.220 --> 00:07:01.290
or it will set
and you'll never get the stain out.

00:07:01.630 --> 00:07:05.130
Quick, go clean it up in the restroom.
I feel just terrible about this.

00:07:05.200 --> 00:07:08.370
It's okay. I'll just be a minute.

00:07:08.430 --> 00:07:10.600
Yes, go quickly. I'm sorry!

00:07:11.200 --> 00:07:12.240
It's nothing.

00:07:17.070 --> 00:07:18.110
(Draw pattern to unlock)

00:07:18.980 --> 00:07:20.210
(Incorrect pattern)

00:07:21.110 --> 00:07:23.250
Gosh, this is driving me crazy.
Why won't it unlock?

00:07:24.350 --> 00:07:25.520
Come on, before she gets back...

00:07:28.020 --> 00:07:29.490
I have to hurry before she gets back...

00:07:30.490 --> 00:07:31.960
I'm sure this was the pattern.

00:07:33.720 --> 00:07:35.590
(Hint)

00:07:40.360 --> 00:07:41.570
So simple-minded.

00:07:59.620 --> 00:08:00.620
Oh my...

00:08:02.050 --> 00:08:03.050
It's fine.

00:08:15.730 --> 00:08:17.840
Fortunately, there's no smoking gun.

00:08:18.540 --> 00:08:21.110
It's a huge relief it didn't capture him
taking down the banner.

00:08:27.280 --> 00:08:28.780
Again, I'm so sorry about that.

00:08:29.850 --> 00:08:30.850
Don't worry about it.

00:08:32.980 --> 00:08:34.820
As I was saying, I asked to see you...

00:08:35.450 --> 00:08:37.390
because you said your dream
was to be a chef, right?

00:08:38.620 --> 00:08:40.790
Your lunch box was so good.

00:08:40.890 --> 00:08:42.230
It's a shame to waste such talent.

00:08:43.560 --> 00:08:44.930
You enjoyed it?

00:08:46.760 --> 00:08:47.830
Thank you.

00:08:47.900 --> 00:08:50.940
There's no need to thank me
for enjoying your food.

00:08:51.570 --> 00:08:53.440
You seem like a very kind person, Jang Mi.

00:08:53.740 --> 00:08:55.870
I saw how good you were
to your mother the other day.

00:08:56.610 --> 00:08:58.610
Not at all.

00:08:58.940 --> 00:09:00.080
I could...

00:09:00.510 --> 00:09:03.680
never love my mom
half as much as she loves me.

00:09:04.180 --> 00:09:05.180
By the way,

00:09:05.820 --> 00:09:08.120
how did your mother have her accident?

00:09:09.050 --> 00:09:10.760
Was it a car accident?

00:09:12.960 --> 00:09:13.960
No.

00:09:14.860 --> 00:09:17.560
She fell into a river
and went into a coma.

00:09:19.700 --> 00:09:20.970
My dad says...

00:09:21.230 --> 00:09:24.970
he's sure it happened while she was
being chased by some bad guys.

00:09:25.940 --> 00:09:29.970
He said he'll make the culprit pay
if he ever catches them.

00:09:30.810 --> 00:09:32.740
- "The culprit?"
- Yes.

00:09:33.010 --> 00:09:34.750
When my dad saw my mom in the hospital,

00:09:35.410 --> 00:09:37.480
her face and hands...

00:09:38.020 --> 00:09:40.790
were all scratched and scraped up
from tree branches.

00:09:41.450 --> 00:09:43.720
So based on that, he's convinced...

00:09:43.990 --> 00:09:45.820
she must have been running
from some bad guys...

00:09:45.820 --> 00:09:47.160
when the accident happened.

00:09:48.030 --> 00:09:50.060
Wait, something doesn't add up.

00:09:51.130 --> 00:09:52.130
Pardon?

00:09:52.130 --> 00:09:55.930
First you mentioned a culprit,
then you said she ran from some bad guys.

00:09:56.670 --> 00:10:00.140
So does that mean your father
actually saw something?

00:10:00.440 --> 00:10:03.870
I'm not exactly sure,

00:10:04.680 --> 00:10:08.350
but my dad swore he wouldn't rest until
he found the person who did this to her,

00:10:08.550 --> 00:10:10.510
so he's been relentlessly searching
for the culprit.

00:10:11.320 --> 00:10:15.090
He insists there has to be a culprit
who's responsible.

00:10:17.250 --> 00:10:18.560
He must have some proof, then?

00:10:19.190 --> 00:10:20.490
He doesn't have any proof,

00:10:21.830 --> 00:10:24.830
but we recently put up a banner about it,

00:10:25.060 --> 00:10:27.730
and some guy secretly took it down.

00:10:28.330 --> 00:10:29.770
What else could that mean?

00:10:30.700 --> 00:10:32.440
It means he's the culprit.

00:10:33.670 --> 00:10:35.510
Oh, is that so?

00:10:37.170 --> 00:10:40.040
I really hope you catch him.
I'll be rooting for you.

00:10:40.540 --> 00:10:41.550
Thank you.

00:10:41.810 --> 00:10:44.320
We'll definitely catch him
and make him pay.

00:10:49.050 --> 00:10:50.150
Where are my manners?

00:10:50.860 --> 00:10:53.090
I brought you here
and all I've done is go off on a tangent.

00:10:54.590 --> 00:10:56.630
The thing is, our company...

00:10:57.090 --> 00:10:59.960
has a program sponsored
by the Dream Scholarship Foundation.

00:11:00.560 --> 00:11:02.030
Our company's motto is,

00:11:02.300 --> 00:11:05.570
We want to be the Dream
for young people with dreams.

00:11:06.670 --> 00:11:11.280
And seeing you work hard while taking care
of your sick mother is so admirable.

00:11:12.580 --> 00:11:15.610
I'd like to send you abroad to study.

00:11:17.310 --> 00:11:18.320
What?

00:11:19.220 --> 00:11:20.350
Study abroad?

00:11:23.990 --> 00:11:24.990
Study abroad?

00:11:26.120 --> 00:11:28.890
CEO Chae is sending you to study abroad?

00:11:29.530 --> 00:11:32.360
- Yes, I'm serious!
- That's amazing!

00:11:32.430 --> 00:11:33.430
Are you serious?

00:11:33.930 --> 00:11:35.530
Where did this suddenly come from?

00:11:35.600 --> 00:11:39.340
I'm still in shock myself.
It feels like I won the lottery.

00:11:39.400 --> 00:11:42.040
I can't believe
such a wonderful person exists.

00:11:42.710 --> 00:11:45.110
She gave you your chance to sing,
Tae Pyung,

00:11:45.540 --> 00:11:47.580
and now she's sending you abroad to study?

00:11:48.650 --> 00:11:50.250
I don't know how we can ever thank her.

00:11:56.150 --> 00:11:57.490
(Lawyer Kang Baek Ho)

00:11:57.590 --> 00:12:00.760
Gosh, I'm dying to know
what CEO Chae said to her.

00:12:01.230 --> 00:12:02.930
Look at her, not even calling.

00:12:03.560 --> 00:12:04.960
I asked her to call me.

00:12:05.130 --> 00:12:06.960
It goes in one ear and out the other.

00:12:09.130 --> 00:12:10.600
Is she still with her?

00:12:16.410 --> 00:12:17.410
No.

00:12:17.780 --> 00:12:20.610
If I call Jang Mi,
she'll think I'm interested in her...

00:12:20.710 --> 00:12:22.110
and get the completely wrong idea.

00:12:30.490 --> 00:12:31.490
Hey, Tae Pyung.

00:12:32.190 --> 00:12:34.090
Is Jang Mi back from her meeting
with CEO Chae?

00:12:35.160 --> 00:12:36.960
What? Study abroad?

00:12:42.100 --> 00:12:43.100
Hi.

00:12:43.170 --> 00:12:46.600
Hwa Young, what's the occasion?
You actually called me first.

00:12:46.740 --> 00:12:48.770
I called because I missed you,
Professor Kang.

00:12:49.510 --> 00:12:51.110
Let's get something delicious.

00:12:51.580 --> 00:12:52.780
You seem happy.

00:12:53.240 --> 00:12:56.150
I am. It feels like a huge weight
has been lifted off my shoulders.

00:12:56.550 --> 00:12:58.620
Everything just fell into place
all at once.

00:13:01.520 --> 00:13:04.160
It's been a while since I've heard you
this happy, Hwa Young,

00:13:04.460 --> 00:13:05.460
and it makes me happy too.

00:13:07.490 --> 00:13:08.490
Here.

00:13:10.960 --> 00:13:12.260
I'm home.

00:13:14.870 --> 00:13:15.870
What's this?

00:13:16.800 --> 00:13:17.800
What?

00:13:21.910 --> 00:13:22.910
Wait a minute.

00:13:25.710 --> 00:13:27.480
- Kang Baek Ho!
- Gosh, you scared me!

00:13:28.950 --> 00:13:29.950
Hey...

00:13:30.480 --> 00:13:34.790
- This is for Jun Ho and your dad.
- That's not fair.

00:13:35.120 --> 00:13:39.120
- So I'm not your son, is that it?
- Oh, please. Don't be so dramatic.

00:13:40.260 --> 00:13:43.690
You know Jun Ho
has his sales review tomorrow.

00:13:44.400 --> 00:13:46.960
That CEO, or whatever she is,
is trying to kick him out.

00:13:47.230 --> 00:13:49.830
She told him to double the sales
or get out.

00:13:50.900 --> 00:13:52.870
That CEO is always the problem.

00:13:52.940 --> 00:13:55.870
I need to make sure Jun Ho eats this
to keep his strength up.

00:13:55.940 --> 00:13:58.740
Fine. It's so unfair,
I wouldn't eat it now if you paid me.

00:13:59.340 --> 00:14:03.380
- I must be adopted, right?
- Come on, the things you say.

00:14:04.850 --> 00:14:08.250
But you seem to have your head
in the clouds lately.

00:14:08.720 --> 00:14:10.990
You should pay more attention to your dad.

00:14:10.990 --> 00:14:11.990
Dad? Why?

00:14:12.060 --> 00:14:13.420
He's going through menopause.

00:14:14.630 --> 00:14:18.030
When you're going through that,
a butterfly can make your heart flutter,

00:14:18.100 --> 00:14:21.230
and a single falling leaf
can make you feel sentimental.

00:14:21.300 --> 00:14:24.200
That's ridiculous.
Dad is going through menopause?

00:14:24.270 --> 00:14:25.570
He's as spry as ever.

00:14:26.270 --> 00:14:28.470
- Are you sure it's not you?
- Good grief, kid.

00:14:28.840 --> 00:14:33.080
I'm well past menopause
and into my golden years.

00:14:33.240 --> 00:14:36.010
But I'm too busy to have time
for any of that nonsense.

00:14:37.950 --> 00:14:39.280
- Why?
- You should have some too, Mom.

00:14:39.350 --> 00:14:42.920
- Hey, stop! Seriously, stop!
- Here, have some too Mom.

00:14:44.590 --> 00:14:47.020
I'll approve it at the office tomorrow,
just so you know.

00:14:49.630 --> 00:14:51.160
I thought I made myself clear
about cutting ingredient costs.

00:14:51.730 --> 00:14:54.060
Tell Chef Kang Jun Ho...

00:14:54.060 --> 00:14:56.600
to get his numbers right
for tomorrow's sales review.

00:15:00.300 --> 00:15:03.310
Are your employees giving you a hard time?

00:15:04.040 --> 00:15:07.110
I hear Chang Restaurant at the hotel
is quite delicious.

00:15:07.280 --> 00:15:12.050
The food itself is delicious.
It's the head chef I can't stand.

00:15:14.290 --> 00:15:15.720
Really? Why is that?

00:15:16.020 --> 00:15:17.960
I would think
that's all that matters for a chef.

00:15:18.390 --> 00:15:22.560
I see. He must have really gotten
on your bad side.

00:15:23.590 --> 00:15:24.600
You know...

00:15:25.100 --> 00:15:27.700
how some employees
just rub you the wrong way?

00:15:28.730 --> 00:15:30.170
When I really think about it,

00:15:30.530 --> 00:15:33.070
maybe I dislike him because he's prickly,
just like me.

00:15:33.140 --> 00:15:35.240
Or because his blunt honesty
gets on my nerves.

00:15:35.310 --> 00:15:36.670
That might be why he bugs me.

00:15:36.740 --> 00:15:39.080
Anyway, he's arrogant,

00:15:39.080 --> 00:15:40.440
and a bit of a jerk.

00:15:41.080 --> 00:15:42.210
I see.

00:15:43.980 --> 00:15:46.450
I can't believe I'm telling you all this.

00:15:48.620 --> 00:15:50.090
I'm actually happy you told me that.

00:15:50.990 --> 00:15:53.220
It feels like you're opening up to me.

00:15:53.960 --> 00:15:56.030
It means you trust me.

00:16:03.200 --> 00:16:06.240
I shouldn't be growing this fond of you.

00:16:08.570 --> 00:16:09.810
And why not?

00:16:10.810 --> 00:16:13.010
You should just follow your heart.

00:16:16.880 --> 00:16:19.480
Your son is Kang Baek Ho,
the lawyer, right?

00:16:20.220 --> 00:16:21.320
Is he your only son?

00:16:23.250 --> 00:16:24.960
No, I have two.

00:16:25.460 --> 00:16:29.060
I can't bring myself to tell her
Kang Jun Ho is my son.

00:16:29.960 --> 00:16:33.300
I thought you only had one.

00:16:34.930 --> 00:16:38.400
Anyway, you're a family man.

00:16:39.170 --> 00:16:42.770
If we follow our hearts,
how far can we really go?

00:16:48.380 --> 00:16:49.980
As far as we can.

00:16:50.480 --> 00:16:51.580
All the way.

00:17:12.970 --> 00:17:16.610
Manager Lee will bring you the paperwork
you need for studying abroad.

00:17:33.690 --> 00:17:36.690
(Suk Hee's Side Dishes)

00:17:39.900 --> 00:17:41.030
I'm home.

00:17:41.330 --> 00:17:43.730
Jang Mi, you're home.

00:17:44.440 --> 00:17:45.940
Good work, Jang Mi.

00:17:48.440 --> 00:17:49.440
Mom.

00:17:50.410 --> 00:17:52.140
Is it really okay for me
to go study abroad?

00:17:53.240 --> 00:17:55.110
I won't be here by your side.

00:17:55.610 --> 00:17:57.350
Is it selfish of me to go for my own sake?

00:17:59.580 --> 00:18:00.650
I'm so sorry.

00:18:01.350 --> 00:18:02.450
Mom.

00:18:02.890 --> 00:18:05.060
But I really want to go.

00:18:07.790 --> 00:18:09.290
Jang Mi, you're so beautiful.

00:18:10.190 --> 00:18:11.760
You're such a good daughter.

00:18:12.830 --> 00:18:14.500
I love you so much, Jang Mi.

00:18:16.300 --> 00:18:17.300
Mom.

00:18:20.470 --> 00:18:21.540
Me too.

00:18:21.710 --> 00:18:23.140
I love you too, Mom.

00:18:23.640 --> 00:18:24.940
I love you, Mom,

00:18:25.510 --> 00:18:26.810
so much.

00:18:51.070 --> 00:18:53.170
Unfortunately, you didn't manage
to double the sales.

00:18:53.970 --> 00:18:55.510
Was I asking for too much?

00:18:58.140 --> 00:18:59.710
A deal's a deal,

00:19:00.640 --> 00:19:03.750
so please leave Chang Restaurant.
Chef Kang Jun Ho.

00:19:04.080 --> 00:19:05.480
That's not going to happen.

00:19:06.550 --> 00:19:08.250
I haven't broken our promise.

00:19:09.020 --> 00:19:10.490
Which is why I'm not leaving.

00:19:11.120 --> 00:19:12.120
What?

00:19:12.660 --> 00:19:15.260
You won't leave
because you didn't break our promise?

00:19:15.490 --> 00:19:16.590
That's right.

00:19:16.960 --> 00:19:18.960
Because I achieved more than
double the sales we promised.

00:19:18.960 --> 00:19:21.100
How is this more than double the sales?

00:19:21.170 --> 00:19:23.570
It is if you include the reservations
in the final tally.

00:19:23.870 --> 00:19:27.200
A fine-dining restaurant can only handle
so many customers a day,

00:19:28.040 --> 00:19:29.810
as I'm sure you're well aware, ma'am.

00:19:30.670 --> 00:19:31.740
Including reservations?

00:19:32.480 --> 00:19:33.980
Where did you learn to do math?

00:19:34.810 --> 00:19:38.580
Sales is based on what's been paid.
Get that straight.

00:19:39.380 --> 00:19:42.090
Reservations can be canceled.
There are too many variables.

00:19:42.520 --> 00:19:44.050
Is it sensible to count them as sales?

00:19:44.050 --> 00:19:46.860
These are non-cancelable
confirmed reservations.

00:19:46.860 --> 00:19:48.490
That brings the total to about 2.15 times.

00:19:51.530 --> 00:19:54.230
These reservations
include prepaid deposits.

00:19:54.970 --> 00:19:56.970
And our special reservations
are fully booked through next year.

00:19:59.240 --> 00:20:02.670
I asked for double the sales,
not the promise of future earnings.

00:20:03.310 --> 00:20:05.380
The numbers need to be backed up by data.

00:20:11.110 --> 00:20:13.880
You've worked hard,
but it's a shame it's come to this.

00:20:14.850 --> 00:20:17.350
Goodbye, Chef Kang Jun Ho.

00:20:27.430 --> 00:20:29.070
Why don't you take a look at this
before you say another word,

00:20:29.870 --> 00:20:31.540
instead of just trying to find
a way to fire me?

00:20:32.200 --> 00:20:33.200
What's this?

00:20:34.100 --> 00:20:36.440
It's the Dream Hotel sales report
for this quarter.

00:20:37.270 --> 00:20:39.610
In your own report on Dream Hotel's
overall performance,

00:20:40.540 --> 00:20:43.210
you included the sales
from room reservations.

00:20:44.950 --> 00:20:49.490
- How did you...
- You said numbers are all about data.

00:20:49.490 --> 00:20:51.590
You're allowed to include reservations,

00:20:52.090 --> 00:20:53.390
so why can't I?

00:20:54.020 --> 00:20:56.330
What kind of logic is that?
It's a double standard.

00:20:59.300 --> 00:21:00.660
Don't ever make
such an unreasonable demand...

00:21:01.370 --> 00:21:03.400
of an employee again.

00:21:04.570 --> 00:21:06.240
And stop looking for excuses to fire them.

00:21:07.540 --> 00:21:10.010
This isn't how you boost employee morale.

00:21:10.640 --> 00:21:13.440
- It just makes them lose trust in you.
- Excuse me?

00:21:13.440 --> 00:21:16.010
And ultimately,
that's bad for Dream Hotel, isn't it?

00:21:17.580 --> 00:21:19.380
But I'm sure you already know that.

00:21:20.150 --> 00:21:21.180
Now, if you'll excuse me.

00:21:28.960 --> 00:21:30.490
That arrogant brat.

00:21:35.030 --> 00:21:36.030
Ma'am.

00:21:36.030 --> 00:21:39.370
The first thing I'll do
is get Kang Jun Ho out of this hotel.

00:21:40.200 --> 00:21:43.510
That arrogant jerk.
I swear, I will fire him.

00:21:44.110 --> 00:21:45.880
Who does he think he is, lecturing me?

00:21:46.480 --> 00:21:47.940
I'll keep a close eye on him.

00:21:48.210 --> 00:21:51.310
And Oh Jang Mi is being ridiculous
about catching the culprit.

00:21:52.380 --> 00:21:54.120
Just take her the study abroad documents
and get it over with.

00:21:54.850 --> 00:21:55.850
Yes, ma'am.

00:21:58.890 --> 00:22:02.660
Don't give it a second thought.
Go study in the US. It's been your dream.

00:22:02.730 --> 00:22:04.930
I just don't know if I should go.

00:22:05.260 --> 00:22:07.130
You'll have such a hard time
on your own, Dad.

00:22:07.400 --> 00:22:09.730
And it'll be tough
taking care of Mom without me.

00:22:09.830 --> 00:22:13.640
- I told you not to worry about us.
- Dad.

00:22:13.700 --> 00:22:16.670
You'll regret it for the rest of your life
if you pass up an opportunity like this.

00:22:18.480 --> 00:22:20.410
- Welcome.
- Manager Lee?

00:22:21.040 --> 00:22:22.080
Welcome.

00:22:23.680 --> 00:22:28.020
You must be from CEO Chae's hotel.
It's nice to meet you.

00:22:28.250 --> 00:22:31.250
We're so grateful for everything
you've done for Jang Mi and Tae Pyung.

00:22:31.890 --> 00:22:35.590
And please give my thanks
to CEO Chae as well.

00:22:36.130 --> 00:22:37.160
I will.

00:22:37.430 --> 00:22:39.830
Here are the necessary documents
for your studies abroad.

00:22:41.500 --> 00:22:42.600
Thank you.

00:22:45.440 --> 00:22:46.440
Suk Hee.

00:23:20.970 --> 00:23:22.010
Wait.

00:23:22.570 --> 00:23:24.240
Mom, what's wrong?

00:23:24.540 --> 00:23:26.610
- Suk Hee?
- Mom.

00:23:27.140 --> 00:23:29.250
- Mom, what's wrong?
- What's wrong?

00:23:30.210 --> 00:23:31.210
Suk Hee?

00:23:34.990 --> 00:23:35.990
Mom.

00:23:37.390 --> 00:23:40.360
Mom, can you hear me?

00:23:40.360 --> 00:23:41.890
- Dad.
- Suk Hee!

00:23:41.960 --> 00:23:44.090
Mom, please, wake up.

00:23:44.760 --> 00:23:46.960
What do I do? Mom...

00:23:47.630 --> 00:23:50.430
What? You're saying
Jung Suk Hee recognized you?

00:23:50.700 --> 00:23:52.540
She was pointing at me
and shaking uncontrollably,

00:23:53.300 --> 00:23:55.070
and she wouldn't stop screaming.

00:23:55.140 --> 00:23:56.640
(CEO Chae Hwa Young)

00:23:56.710 --> 00:23:57.940
Darn it.

00:23:58.310 --> 00:24:00.580
So it's true. The emotions remain
even when the memory is gone.

00:24:01.750 --> 00:24:02.910
What are we going to do about this?

00:24:03.050 --> 00:24:06.280
There's a chance Oh Jang Mi and her family
might start to suspect me.

00:24:06.480 --> 00:24:07.720
For the time being,

00:24:08.250 --> 00:24:10.420
you had better stay far away
from Jung Suk Hee.

00:24:12.360 --> 00:24:15.060
I can't let my guard down
for one second with those lowlives.

00:24:16.830 --> 00:24:19.200
I should just make both Jung Suk Hee
and Oh Jang Mi disappear.

00:24:19.260 --> 00:24:23.570
Still, if Oh Jang Mi goes to the US,
we'll be able to breathe a little easier.

00:24:23.770 --> 00:24:25.340
We need to get her out of here, fast.

00:24:33.580 --> 00:24:35.650
I'm just glad it wasn't any worse.

00:24:36.010 --> 00:24:38.480
She's finally calmed down
and fallen asleep.

00:24:38.950 --> 00:24:39.950
Yes.

00:24:41.280 --> 00:24:42.350
But, Dad...

00:24:43.220 --> 00:24:44.990
That episode Mom had,

00:24:44.990 --> 00:24:46.920
it seemed different than usual.

00:24:47.860 --> 00:24:48.960
It did, didn't it?

00:24:49.730 --> 00:24:52.700
Why would she get so agitated
and point at that man?

00:24:52.760 --> 00:24:53.800
I know, right?

00:24:54.060 --> 00:24:56.270
She was trembling
just looking at Manager Lee.

00:24:56.670 --> 00:24:57.730
I wonder why.

00:24:58.340 --> 00:24:59.340
I don't know.

00:25:00.740 --> 00:25:01.740
What is this?

00:25:03.770 --> 00:25:04.810
Tae Sook.

00:25:05.710 --> 00:25:07.440
The Dream Scholarship Foundation?

00:25:07.440 --> 00:25:09.480
What? LA?

00:25:10.810 --> 00:25:13.520
- You're studying abroad?
- I'm sorry, Tae Sook.

00:25:14.350 --> 00:25:15.790
It just kind of happened.

00:25:16.820 --> 00:25:19.890
- Don't go. No, you can't go.
- Tae Sook.

00:25:20.790 --> 00:25:23.890
This is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity.

00:25:24.160 --> 00:25:27.460
You know how much I've always wanted
to study abroad.

00:25:27.960 --> 00:25:29.930
The company is paying for everything.

00:25:29.930 --> 00:25:32.240
You think it's about money? Are you mad?

00:25:32.670 --> 00:25:34.300
What about Mom?
How can you even think of leaving her?

00:25:34.840 --> 00:25:35.840
The thing is...

00:25:36.640 --> 00:25:40.510
I'm worried about Mom too,

00:25:42.010 --> 00:25:43.650
but I really want to go.

00:25:44.250 --> 00:25:46.980
This is the last chance I'll ever get.

00:25:47.050 --> 00:25:49.120
Think about Mom.

00:25:49.620 --> 00:25:52.120
Don't you know she starts looking for you
the second you're out of her sight?

00:25:53.860 --> 00:25:54.890
I'm against it.

00:25:55.460 --> 00:25:57.490
I am against you studying abroad.

00:25:58.500 --> 00:26:00.500
Let me be clear. I am against it.

00:26:07.740 --> 00:26:10.740
(Suk Hee's Side Dishes)

00:26:14.240 --> 00:26:15.250
Yes, Detective.

00:26:16.150 --> 00:26:17.310
I'm counting on you.

00:26:17.910 --> 00:26:18.920
Right.

00:26:19.820 --> 00:26:23.250
I think the culprit from that banner video
will get caught soon.

00:26:24.020 --> 00:26:26.020
- Really?
- Yes.

00:26:27.120 --> 00:26:28.120
By the way, Jang Mi,

00:26:28.660 --> 00:26:30.030
have you decided to study abroad?

00:26:32.260 --> 00:26:34.600
You're asking why I'm against it?

00:26:36.500 --> 00:26:39.940
Seriously. It's because
I hate seeing you struggle!

00:26:40.240 --> 00:26:44.170
After everything you've been through
paying for Mom's medical bills...

00:26:44.270 --> 00:26:45.380
That's enough.

00:26:46.210 --> 00:26:48.910
Do you know why Jang Mi keeps going on
about wanting to study abroad?

00:26:49.310 --> 00:26:52.250
It's too much for her
to take care of Mother who isn't well.

00:26:52.320 --> 00:26:53.980
She just wants to abandon her
and run away.

00:26:54.050 --> 00:26:57.590
Oh Tae Sook, stop it.
How can you say that about your sister?

00:26:58.150 --> 00:26:59.360
Sister? Please.

00:27:02.190 --> 00:27:04.130
It's time you told Jang Mi the truth, Dad.

00:27:04.960 --> 00:27:08.530
Tell her that her mom is Suk Hee,
but Dad isn't her biological father.

00:27:08.730 --> 00:27:11.270
Tell her that she's not blood-related
to us at all!

00:27:11.330 --> 00:27:14.870
I said stop.
If you say that one more time,

00:27:15.140 --> 00:27:16.140
I'm done with you.

00:27:16.210 --> 00:27:19.510
I don't care if you're done with me.
Just please, tell Jang Mi.

00:27:19.740 --> 00:27:23.080
- You need to stop this too, Dad!
- Just stop it, Oh Tae Sook.

00:27:24.950 --> 00:27:26.180
Let's talk about this later.

00:27:36.590 --> 00:27:37.590
Jang Mi...

00:27:54.680 --> 00:27:56.210
(The First Man)

00:27:56.280 --> 00:27:58.920
I didn't know anything.

00:27:59.450 --> 00:28:02.650
- Jang Mi.
- This isn't the world I thought I knew.

00:28:03.520 --> 00:28:05.420
It feels like I'm living
in a completely different world.

00:28:05.690 --> 00:28:08.830
Chairman, what if we invited
Chef Kang Jun Ho over?

00:28:09.160 --> 00:28:11.590
Ma Seo Rin.
This was your doing, wasn't it?

00:28:12.030 --> 00:28:14.800
Do you think Kang Jun Ho would come here
just because you invited him?

00:28:15.200 --> 00:28:17.670
This is the last letter Suk Hee sent me.

00:28:17.930 --> 00:28:20.170
I hear you're not studying abroad.

00:28:20.170 --> 00:28:22.570
Was there a sudden change of heart?

00:28:22.740 --> 00:28:25.210
Because I found out the truth
about my birth.

00:28:27.610 --> 00:28:29.610
