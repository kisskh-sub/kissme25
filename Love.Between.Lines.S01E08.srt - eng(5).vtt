00:02:03.670 --> 00:02:05.030
Changing one's name...

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:08.030
Truly pathetic.

00:02:10.150 --> 00:02:11.630
Your brother changed his name.

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:12.960
He took my surname.

00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:14.420
His name is Xiao Zhiyu now.

00:02:14.710 --> 00:02:16.310
From now on,

00:02:16.460 --> 00:02:18.660
you can't call him by his original name.

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:21.800
Mr. Xiao.

00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:24.400
Should we call everyone for a meeting

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:26.990
to discuss the project requirements
Lyman just mentioned?

00:02:26.990 --> 00:02:28.520
Let's talk when we get back.

00:02:42.520 --> 00:02:43.560
Zhuling

00:02:43.710 --> 00:02:46.310
has several branch offices
in prefecture-level cities.

00:02:46.310 --> 00:02:47.840
They're small operations,

00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:50.610
perfect for someone to keep a low profile.

00:02:50.710 --> 00:02:51.710
Pick one

00:02:51.730 --> 00:02:52.990

00:02:52.990 --> 00:02:54.010

When a dog is starved for three days,

00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:12.690
it will naturally look for leftovers.

00:03:13.800 --> 00:03:15.870
The difference between humans and dogs

00:03:15.870 --> 00:03:16.680
is that humans

00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:18.870
can't wait that long.

00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:22.560
Let's go.

00:03:29.010 --> 00:03:31.520
Why was Mr. Xiao unhappy just now?

00:03:31.540 --> 00:03:33.540
Wasn't the meeting going smoothly?

00:03:35.360 --> 00:03:38.000
That's because our opponent this time
is Zhuling again.

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:38.800
Zhuling again?

00:03:38.800 --> 00:03:39.730
What do you mean?

You just joined us, so you don't know yet.

Previously, several projects at our studio

00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:44.520
were won by Mr. Xiao

00:03:44.520 --> 00:03:46.630
from Zhuling.

00:03:47.430 --> 00:03:49.710
Honestly,
we've been speculating in private

00:03:49.710 --> 00:03:51.710
that he's deliberately targeting Zhuling.

00:03:51.710 --> 00:03:53.240
But why Zhuling?

00:03:53.680 --> 00:03:55.360
Just because they're the industry leader?

00:03:55.360 --> 00:03:56.800
That we don't know.

00:03:56.800 --> 00:03:58.150

Whatever conflicts they have,

00:03:59.240 --> 00:04:01.500
there's no way they'd air them publicly.

00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:06.360
Do you think

00:04:06.470 --> 00:04:08.130
what happened to Jiang Tianyi

00:04:08.590 --> 00:04:10.190
could be related to Zhuling?

My leg isn't fully healed yet,

I can only treat you with them.

Got it.

00:09:21.750 --> 00:09:23.750
According to the geological survey report,

00:09:23.750 --> 00:09:25.200
most of this area

00:09:25.200 --> 00:09:26.670
has good foundation conditions.

00:09:26.670 --> 00:09:27.800
It belongs to Zone N.

00:09:27.960 --> 00:09:29.890
Only the southern part over there—

00:09:30.320 --> 00:09:31.550
that's Zone S.

00:09:33.270 --> 00:09:35.000
Shanghai has a lot of soft soil;

00:09:35.480 --> 00:09:36.540
it's unavoidable.

00:09:38.240 --> 00:09:39.360
That means foundation treatment costs

00:09:39.360 --> 00:09:41.510
for the southern area will be higher.

00:09:42.270 --> 00:09:43.030
I'm not sure

00:09:43.030 --> 00:09:44.960
if it will affect our overall plan.

00:09:50.120 --> 00:09:51.960
Or we could move
these 2 originally planned buildings

00:09:51.960 --> 00:09:53.000
to the south.

00:09:53.270 --> 00:09:55.150
But Mr. Xiao is a perfectionist.

00:09:55.370 --> 00:09:58.370
He'll definitely want
to rearrange the orientation.

00:10:01.320 --> 00:10:02.120
What's wrong?

00:10:02.630 --> 00:10:03.790
I'm thinking...

00:10:04.120 --> 00:10:06.000
that no matter where we build them
or how we build them,

00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:07.270
ultimately we have to consider

00:10:07.270 --> 00:10:09.270
how to deal with that soft soil area.

00:10:09.720 --> 00:10:11.320
That's another budget item.

00:10:12.630 --> 00:10:13.720
But this expense

00:10:13.720 --> 00:10:15.480
is unavoidable.

00:10:15.570 --> 00:10:16.370
That's right.

00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:18.530
Mr. Xiao always emphasizes

00:10:18.590 --> 00:10:19.490
that when it comes to designing,

00:10:19.490 --> 00:10:21.660
safety issues are non-negotiable.

00:10:22.430 --> 00:10:24.320
We definitely need to consider
soil replacement.

00:10:24.320 --> 00:10:26.780
It's to thoroughly improve the foundation.

00:10:27.270 --> 00:10:29.720
But soil replacement
requires a lot of labor,

00:10:29.720 --> 00:10:31.870
and our design costs are already high.

00:10:34.720 --> 00:10:36.120
It's quite challenging.

00:10:42.390 --> 00:10:43.510
You are nervous?

00:10:44.750 --> 00:10:45.870
What are you talking about?

00:10:45.870 --> 00:10:47.000
Aren't you nervous?

00:10:49.320 --> 00:10:50.790
I'm... I'm fine.

00:10:51.120 --> 00:10:53.520
You know our competitor is Zhuling, right?

00:10:54.480 --> 00:10:55.150
Yes, I know.

00:10:57.630 --> 00:10:59.030
You're quite something.

00:10:59.240 --> 00:11:00.750
I'm impressed, Hu Xiu.

00:11:01.270 --> 00:11:03.070
You've got quite strong nerves.

00:11:03.550 --> 00:11:05.720
I believe in Mr. Xiao's design.

00:11:06.750 --> 00:11:07.670
Of course.

00:11:07.670 --> 00:11:08.800
I believe in him too.

00:11:09.270 --> 00:11:10.320
Mr. Xiao's designs

00:11:10.320 --> 00:11:11.720
have always been unique.

00:11:11.750 --> 00:11:13.600
After competing with Zhuling
for so many years,

00:11:13.600 --> 00:11:15.930
we're not necessarily at a disadvantage.

00:11:24.870 --> 00:11:26.200
But Zhuling...

00:11:26.550 --> 00:11:28.000
is a big, well-established company.

00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:29.800
Their strengths lie elsewhere.

00:11:29.960 --> 00:11:30.840
Secretary Li.

00:11:31.510 --> 00:11:32.080
Thank you for coming.

00:11:32.080 --> 00:11:32.840
Mr. Pei.

00:11:32.870 --> 00:11:33.870
Please, this way.

00:11:34.200 --> 00:11:35.130
Watch your step.

00:11:36.120 --> 00:11:37.750
The environment here is quite nice.

00:11:37.750 --> 00:11:38.390
Yes.

00:11:38.960 --> 00:11:41.360
We plan to utilize
the entire water system.

00:11:42.720 --> 00:11:45.250
That person
is from the Construction Bureau.

00:11:46.440 --> 00:11:47.390
The area we're looking at now

00:11:47.390 --> 00:11:48.720
is the core landscape zone.

00:11:48.720 --> 00:11:51.380
Supporting facilities
will be at the entrance.

00:11:56.550 --> 00:11:58.630
Try as much as you can to avoid the part

00:11:58.630 --> 00:12:00.150
where clay is under the water.

00:12:00.150 --> 00:12:01.810
The foundation must be solid.

00:12:03.870 --> 00:12:05.550
So Zhuling's advantage

00:12:05.790 --> 00:12:07.050
is their connections.

00:12:07.390 --> 00:12:09.240
Having connections makes things easier.

00:12:09.240 --> 00:12:11.300
And it helps keep project costs down.

00:12:11.440 --> 00:12:12.720
Like I just said,

00:12:12.830 --> 00:12:14.200
Mr. Xiao's skills are top-notch,

00:12:14.200 --> 00:12:16.330
but the corresponding costs are high.

00:12:16.540 --> 00:12:17.990
In terms of cost-effectiveness,

00:12:17.990 --> 00:12:19.450
we might not have the edge.

00:12:20.510 --> 00:12:22.270
So the only thing we can rely on

00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:24.600
is Mr. Xiao's design?

00:12:26.360 --> 00:12:27.120
Right.

00:12:30.560 --> 00:12:31.370
Good luck.

00:12:33.130 --> 00:12:33.920
Take this.

00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:42.770
If that's the case,

00:12:42.770 --> 00:12:44.170
this area will be wasted.

00:12:45.260 --> 00:12:46.720
We need to do it over there,

00:12:46.960 --> 00:12:48.510
because it allows for future extension.

00:12:48.510 --> 00:12:49.640
The other side is...

00:12:55.170 --> 00:12:56.130
Hello, Ms. Zhou.

00:12:58.320 --> 00:12:59.170
A meeting?

00:13:00.150 --> 00:13:01.030
Now?

00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:03.870
I'm on the site.

00:13:05.090 --> 00:13:05.690
It's fine.

00:13:06.310 --> 00:13:07.440
We'll head back now.

00:13:08.360 --> 00:13:09.220
What happened?

00:13:09.790 --> 00:13:11.650
Some details in the previous plan

00:13:11.870 --> 00:13:14.400
aren't fully aligned
with Ms. Zhou's budget.

00:13:14.670 --> 00:13:16.000
Mr. Xiao and Ms. Zhou
need to have a meeting

00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:17.460
to reconfirm everything.

00:13:17.550 --> 00:13:19.080
We need to get back quickly.

00:13:20.480 --> 00:13:21.630
You go back first.

00:13:22.670 --> 00:13:23.530
I'll stay here.

00:13:23.870 --> 00:13:24.630
It's getting late.

00:13:24.630 --> 00:13:26.230
Is it okay for you to be alone?

00:13:26.960 --> 00:13:28.720
Since I'm already here, and...

00:13:29.320 --> 00:13:30.980
based on the materials I have,

00:13:31.000 --> 00:13:33.360
the difference between the site elevation

00:13:33.360 --> 00:13:34.940
and the road elevation on-site
is a bit large.

00:13:34.940 --> 00:13:36.400
I want to measure it again.

00:13:37.510 --> 00:13:38.270
You go back.

00:13:38.840 --> 00:13:39.570
And this too.

00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:40.480
Here.

00:13:43.200 --> 00:13:44.060
I can handle it.

00:13:44.120 --> 00:13:45.180
You're excellent.

00:13:45.720 --> 00:13:46.580
I am excellent.

00:13:48.220 --> 00:13:49.550
Be careful on your own.

00:13:49.570 --> 00:13:50.210
Okay.

00:13:50.350 --> 00:13:51.750

Mr. Xiao.

00:14:02.720 --> 00:14:04.910
We have these ideas
for the three-dimensional

00:14:04.910 --> 00:14:05.380

Thank you.

00:15:20.080 --> 00:15:21.480
Where's your colleague?

00:15:22.040 --> 00:15:23.560
He had to leave early.

00:15:25.480 --> 00:15:27.210
How about I give you a ride home?

00:15:27.910 --> 00:15:28.630
It's fine.

00:15:29.090 --> 00:15:30.020
I'll take a taxi.

00:15:31.670 --> 00:15:32.320
Thanks.

00:15:54.110 --> 00:15:55.640
It's hard to get a taxi here,

00:15:55.700 --> 00:15:56.950
and it's raining now.

00:15:59.420 --> 00:16:00.380
I'll wait.

00:16:00.850 --> 00:16:02.180
I can go to the main road.

00:16:04.440 --> 00:16:06.170
Ms. Hu, do you dislike me?

00:16:10.540 --> 00:16:11.300
I...

00:16:11.600 --> 00:16:13.040
Given the relationship
between our two companies,

00:16:13.040 --> 00:16:13.980
I completely understand if you want

00:16:13.980 --> 00:16:15.470
to keep your distance from me.

00:16:15.470 --> 00:16:16.800
But for safety reasons,

00:16:16.940 --> 00:16:18.250
there's no way I, a grown man,

00:16:18.250 --> 00:16:19.720
would let a girl

00:16:19.920 --> 00:16:21.070
stay here alone.

00:16:22.920 --> 00:16:23.980
Let's go together.

00:16:34.340 --> 00:16:34.890
Hu Xiu,

00:16:34.940 --> 00:16:35.650
are you home?

00:16:35.650 --> 00:16:37.480
It looks like it's raining outside.

00:16:37.480 --> 00:16:38.210
Don't worry.

00:16:38.360 --> 00:16:39.620
I'm already in the car.

00:16:40.240 --> 00:16:40.740
Alright.

00:16:40.740 --> 00:16:42.380
Then let me know when you get home.

00:16:42.380 --> 00:16:43.140
It's Hu Xiu?

00:16:44.090 --> 00:16:45.350
What's wrong with her?

00:16:45.420 --> 00:16:46.970
Didn't I go to the site today?

00:16:46.970 --> 00:16:48.340
I couldn't find an assistant at the time,

00:16:48.340 --> 00:16:49.800
so I asked her to go with me.

00:16:50.080 --> 00:16:51.150
She's not back yet?

00:16:51.150 --> 00:16:52.360
She insisted on staying there

00:16:52.360 --> 00:16:53.650
to verify the elevation differences
on site.

00:16:53.650 --> 00:16:55.870
But she just said
she's already in the car.

00:16:55.870 --> 00:16:56.910
Okay, I got it.

00:16:57.840 --> 00:16:58.510
Sun,

00:16:58.660 --> 00:17:00.790
you really don't go easy on newcomers.

00:17:01.360 --> 00:17:02.270
Hu Xiu has been here for so long.

00:17:02.270 --> 00:17:03.670
She's hardly a newcomer anymore.

00:17:03.670 --> 00:17:05.130
Besides, you have no idea,

00:17:05.240 --> 00:17:07.020
but the people from Zhuling
were also there today.

00:17:07.020 --> 00:17:08.150
It was quite a scene.

00:17:09.220 --> 00:17:10.060
Young man,

00:17:10.310 --> 00:17:12.369
you should feel some sense of crisis.

00:17:13.099 --> 00:17:13.760
Get to work.

00:17:27.470 --> 00:17:29.530
Ms. Hu, you don't need to be so formal.

00:17:29.640 --> 00:17:30.590
Actually,

00:17:30.990 --> 00:17:32.790
we should have been colleagues.

00:17:33.960 --> 00:17:34.920
How did you know?

00:17:35.310 --> 00:17:36.830
An outstanding candidate like you

00:17:36.830 --> 00:17:38.670
certainly leaves a deep impression.

00:17:38.670 --> 00:17:39.910
It's just a pity

00:17:40.960 --> 00:17:42.960
that you didn't choose us in the end.

00:17:45.680 --> 00:17:46.960
Being able to interview at Zhuling

00:17:46.960 --> 00:17:48.070
was an honor.

00:17:48.260 --> 00:17:50.430
It was just that my career goals

00:17:50.590 --> 00:17:53.450
might not have fully aligned
with Zhuling's needs.

00:17:55.740 --> 00:17:56.940
That was our mistake.

00:17:57.240 --> 00:17:59.720
HR's assessment of you was off.

00:18:01.010 --> 00:18:02.290
If possible,

00:18:02.850 --> 00:18:04.020
I wonder if you'd be willing to

00:18:04.020 --> 00:18:05.830
give me another chance.

00:18:07.120 --> 00:18:08.520
You're too kind, Mr. Pei.

00:18:08.680 --> 00:18:09.920
I'm already really grateful

00:18:09.920 --> 00:18:11.780
that you drove me back in the rain.

00:18:15.720 --> 00:18:16.810
It was no trouble.

00:18:17.790 --> 00:18:18.680
As a boss,

00:18:18.790 --> 00:18:20.070
I would never leave my employee

00:18:20.070 --> 00:18:21.270
alone at the site.

00:18:22.720 --> 00:18:23.510
Indeed.

00:18:23.960 --> 00:18:26.220
My colleague wanted me to leave with him.

00:18:26.290 --> 00:18:28.730
It was my fault—
I just wanted to hurry a bit.

00:18:29.830 --> 00:18:30.750
Sounds like you've been

00:18:30.750 --> 00:18:31.510
fairly happy

00:18:31.510 --> 00:18:32.750
at Dynamism.

00:18:33.960 --> 00:18:34.640
Of course.

00:18:34.880 --> 00:18:35.960
After all, working in this field

00:18:35.960 --> 00:18:37.510
has always been my dream.

00:18:37.880 --> 00:18:38.550
And Dynamism

00:18:38.550 --> 00:18:39.160
is a

00:18:39.160 --> 00:18:40.560
very open-minded place.

00:18:42.280 --> 00:18:43.080
Open-minded?

00:18:44.590 --> 00:18:45.720
What about Mr. Xiao?

00:18:46.200 --> 00:18:47.460
Is he open-minded too?

00:18:48.590 --> 00:18:50.310
Even before I started working,

00:18:50.310 --> 00:18:52.040
I already admired his designs.

00:18:56.510 --> 00:18:58.240
Mr. Xiao is young and talented.

00:18:58.830 --> 00:19:00.490
He's always been impressive.

I asked Zhou Yan to contact you.

00:21:12.350 --> 00:21:14.940
The park's identification system
often malfunctions.

00:21:14.940 --> 00:21:15.900
I'll walk back.

00:21:17.270 --> 00:21:18.110

Of course.

That's why
we went to check out the site today.

00:21:36.820 --> 00:21:37.750

00:21:38.260 --> 00:21:39.990
as a member of the project team,

00:21:40.110 --> 00:21:42.170
you should keep a distance from them.

they were going to raise the rent before?

00:25:05.910 --> 00:25:08.010
You want to play murder mystery games?

00:25:08.010 --> 00:25:09.730
I'm discussing a project.

00:25:09.830 --> 00:25:10.480
That client

00:25:10.480 --> 00:25:11.830
wants us to develop

a business park
management software product.

When I asked further,

00:25:14.110 --> 00:25:15.310
I found out he's from Fangyun Group—

00:25:15.310 --> 00:25:17.740
the one in charge
of your park's operations.

00:25:17.740 --> 00:25:18.960
He's just been transferred there

00:25:18.960 --> 00:25:20.510
and is extremely interested

00:25:20.510 --> 00:25:21.910
in murder mystery games.

00:25:22.110 --> 00:25:24.200
So you want to take him to play?

00:25:24.440 --> 00:25:24.960
Yes.

00:25:25.950 --> 00:25:28.550
But I know nothing
about murder mystery games.

00:25:28.990 --> 00:25:31.190
I'm afraid it might get awkward by then.

00:25:31.240 --> 00:25:33.210
What's so hard about playing a game?

00:25:33.210 --> 00:25:33.760
Here's the plan:

00:25:33.760 --> 00:25:35.160
let's call Hu Xiu along.

00:25:35.190 --> 00:25:36.160
More people means more fun.

00:25:36.160 --> 00:25:37.640
She's way more experienced than I am now.

00:25:37.640 --> 00:25:39.310
That would be wonderful.

00:25:40.110 --> 00:25:40.720

00:25:41.400 --> 00:25:42.350
You're the best.

The food you prepared today is delicious.

00:25:46.520 --> 00:25:47.650
Then have some more.

00:25:53.820 --> 00:25:54.660
Mr. Xiao.

00:26:05.600 --> 00:26:08.030
The southern part near the river
is all soft soil.

00:26:08.030 --> 00:26:09.480
Foundation treatment costs will be high.

00:26:09.480 --> 00:26:11.470
I think what Sun said before has a point.

00:26:11.470 --> 00:26:13.110
Why don't we move
the detached houses in the plan

00:26:13.110 --> 00:26:14.570
over to the southern part?

00:26:14.720 --> 00:26:16.400
What about the orientation and lighting?

00:26:16.400 --> 00:26:17.920
Orientation can be adjusted.

00:26:17.920 --> 00:26:20.030
Having the side facing the water
is actually not a problem.

00:26:20.030 --> 00:26:20.750
The most important thing

00:26:20.750 --> 00:26:23.550
is to make the waterfront concept
work to its fullest.

00:26:23.550 --> 00:26:25.270
In Shanghai's modern architecture,

00:26:25.270 --> 00:26:27.480
there are many riverside buildings,

00:26:27.590 --> 00:26:28.750
but most

00:26:28.750 --> 00:26:30.950
have a certain distance from the water.

00:26:31.150 --> 00:26:33.080
Designs like a fitness path
along the river

00:26:33.080 --> 00:26:33.920
are too conventional,

00:26:33.920 --> 00:26:36.270
and they don't fit the lane-style elements
we're aiming for.

00:26:36.270 --> 00:26:37.720
You mean...

00:26:38.010 --> 00:26:39.140
waterfront lanes?

00:26:39.410 --> 00:26:39.960
Yes.

00:26:40.160 --> 00:26:41.230
In Shanghai,

00:26:41.250 --> 00:26:43.210
most lanes are in the city center.

00:26:43.400 --> 00:26:45.210
Apart from some nearby ancient towns,

00:26:45.210 --> 00:26:47.400
waterfront lanes are actually very rare.

00:26:47.400 --> 00:26:49.400
Since Lyman's site is by the water,

00:26:49.510 --> 00:26:50.550
we could consider

00:26:50.550 --> 00:26:52.200
this kind of waterside-perching layout,

00:26:52.200 --> 00:26:55.260
creating a contemporary version
of a waterfront lane.

00:26:59.180 --> 00:27:01.240
This proposal is worth considering.

00:27:02.210 --> 00:27:03.810
It has practical potential.

00:27:07.480 --> 00:27:08.160
Hu Xiu,

00:27:08.680 --> 00:27:10.310
your ideas are bold,

00:27:10.420 --> 00:27:12.100
but they're very creative.

00:27:12.880 --> 00:27:14.010
Thank you, Ms. Zhou.

00:27:14.080 --> 00:27:15.740
Boldness brings innovation.

At Dynamism,

00:27:17.160 --> 00:27:19.420
there's no need to stick to conventions.

00:27:22.350 --> 00:27:23.210
Well, Ms. Zhou,

00:27:23.220 --> 00:27:24.620
I'll get back to work now.

00:27:32.200 --> 00:27:33.440
Not bad, this girl.

00:27:34.030 --> 00:27:36.080
She keeps her emotions in check.

00:27:36.270 --> 00:27:36.950
Yesterday,

00:27:36.980 --> 00:27:38.750
seeing so many people
from Zhuling go there

00:27:38.750 --> 00:27:40.590
and how they have connections
to the Construction Bureau,

00:27:40.590 --> 00:27:41.920
she was really worried.

00:27:41.920 --> 00:27:43.350
She insisted on checking and verifying

00:27:43.350 --> 00:27:45.750
all the site conditions before going home.

00:27:47.650 --> 00:27:49.040
Alright, let's settle on this for now.

00:27:49.040 --> 00:27:50.440
Next, I'll handle the coordination.

00:27:50.440 --> 00:27:51.830

00:27:51.830 --> 00:27:52.700

00:27:54.640 --> 00:27:55.440
What's wrong?

00:27:57.920 --> 00:27:58.510
Nothing.

00:28:12.310 --> 00:28:14.440
Why are you still working after hours?

00:28:15.390 --> 00:28:16.700
I need to grow up

00:28:16.720 --> 00:28:18.300
in the shortest time possible.

00:28:18.300 --> 00:28:20.230
I want those who don't believe in me

00:28:20.320 --> 00:28:22.180
to see what I'm really capable of.

00:28:23.960 --> 00:28:25.550
What upset you this time?

00:28:27.590 --> 00:28:28.150
Nothing.

00:28:29.510 --> 00:28:31.370
You need to balance work and rest.

00:28:31.700 --> 00:28:32.170
How about this?

00:28:32.170 --> 00:28:33.110
Wang is taking his client

00:28:33.110 --> 00:28:34.590
to a murder mystery game tonight.

00:28:34.590 --> 00:28:35.350
Let's join them,

00:28:35.350 --> 00:28:36.410
just to relax a bit.

00:28:38.600 --> 00:28:40.560
Can I skip it?

00:28:41.290 --> 00:28:43.040
Wang is going there for business.

00:28:43.040 --> 00:28:44.790
It'll be boring for me if I go alone.

00:28:44.790 --> 00:28:46.530
Didn't you like playing that game before?

00:28:46.530 --> 00:28:47.990
Just come with me, please?

00:28:48.990 --> 00:28:51.750
I had a falling out with Qin Xiaoyi there.

00:28:51.770 --> 00:28:53.530
It'll be awkward if I see him.

00:28:54.960 --> 00:28:56.790
When I went to the club
to pick up the tickets today,

00:28:56.790 --> 00:28:57.880
it was Li Yue there.

00:28:57.880 --> 00:28:59.610
It should be his session today.

00:29:00.290 --> 00:29:00.940
Li Yue?

00:29:07.160 --> 00:29:08.160
Fine, I'll go.

00:29:09.090 --> 00:29:10.090
That's my friend.

00:29:14.000 --> 00:29:15.400
Are these the most expensive beans?

00:29:15.400 --> 00:29:16.200
Yes.

00:29:18.300 --> 00:29:18.870
Mr. Qian.

00:29:19.160 --> 00:29:19.710
Mr. Guangming.

00:29:19.710 --> 00:29:20.740
Just call me Qian.

00:29:20.960 --> 00:29:21.820
Alright, Qian.

00:29:22.310 --> 00:29:23.440
I brought you some coffee.

00:29:23.440 --> 00:29:24.000
Thanks.

00:29:24.680 --> 00:29:25.680
Let me introduce you.

00:29:25.680 --> 00:29:26.810
This is Qian Jinxin.

00:29:27.000 --> 00:29:29.730
He's in charge
of operations for the entire park.

00:29:29.830 --> 00:29:30.690
This is my wife,

00:29:30.880 --> 00:29:31.680
Zhao Xiaorou.

00:29:31.680 --> 00:29:32.240
The café

00:29:32.240 --> 00:29:32.590
across the street,

00:29:32.590 --> 00:29:33.160
Regard,

00:29:33.240 --> 00:29:34.070
is hers.

00:29:35.070 --> 00:29:36.790
I saw it when I passed by earlier.

00:29:36.790 --> 00:29:37.650
It's very nice.

00:29:37.880 --> 00:29:39.940
Thanks. Feel free to drop by anytime.

00:29:40.790 --> 00:29:41.650
And who is this?

00:29:42.070 --> 00:29:43.330
My best friend, Hu Xiu.

00:29:44.790 --> 00:29:45.240
Hello.

00:29:45.790 --> 00:29:46.350
Hello.

00:29:47.710 --> 00:29:48.910
Let's go get our tickets checked first.

00:29:48.910 --> 00:29:49.460
Sure.

00:29:49.670 --> 00:29:50.870
Let's check in first.

00:29:52.720 --> 00:29:53.160
Honey,

00:29:53.830 --> 00:29:54.920
teach me how to play now.

00:29:54.920 --> 00:29:57.120
I don't want to embarrass myself later.

00:30:05.120 --> 00:30:05.840
Ms. Hu,

00:30:06.310 --> 00:30:07.000
you have such elegant poise.

00:30:07.000 --> 00:30:08.530
Did you study dance before?

00:30:09.280 --> 00:30:10.000
No.

00:30:11.730 --> 00:30:13.940
You should explore more in the arts.

00:30:14.350 --> 00:30:15.480
You're so young.

00:30:15.760 --> 00:30:18.040
You should try more new things.

00:30:19.300 --> 00:30:20.500
You're really funny.

00:30:21.030 --> 00:30:22.270
I'm not joking.

00:30:23.750 --> 00:30:24.880
Alright, players for the next session,

00:30:24.880 --> 00:30:26.240
you may start choosing your boxes now.

00:30:26.240 --> 00:30:26.880
Attention,

00:30:26.880 --> 00:30:27.440
drinks

00:30:27.440 --> 00:30:28.790
are not allowed in the game area.

00:30:28.790 --> 00:30:29.920
If you need to store them,

00:30:29.920 --> 00:30:31.520
there's a locker over there.

00:30:36.590 --> 00:30:37.110
Qian!

00:30:37.790 --> 00:30:38.520
Choose a box.

00:30:41.480 --> 00:30:43.340
What were you guys talking about?

00:30:43.440 --> 00:30:44.270
Nothing.

00:30:44.430 --> 00:30:46.230
Is that guy Guangming's client?

00:30:46.840 --> 00:30:48.680
They're discussing a collaboration.

00:30:48.680 --> 00:30:49.550
Qian Jinxin

00:30:49.550 --> 00:30:51.550
was recently transferred to this park.

00:30:51.550 --> 00:30:52.960
He wants Wang to develop

00:30:52.960 --> 00:30:54.510
a park management software product
for him.

00:30:54.510 --> 00:30:56.750
Later,
things like access control, parking,

00:30:56.750 --> 00:30:57.750
and property management

00:30:57.750 --> 00:30:59.860
can all be handled through this software.

00:30:59.860 --> 00:31:01.120
How do you know so much?

00:31:02.360 --> 00:31:03.290
I have no choice.

00:31:03.480 --> 00:31:05.020
Wang is in the early stage of his startup.

00:31:05.020 --> 00:31:06.790
I want to provide all the support I can,

00:31:06.790 --> 00:31:08.000
and help him secure

00:31:08.000 --> 00:31:09.330
any potential clients.

00:31:10.030 --> 00:31:10.640
Let's go.

00:31:10.660 --> 00:31:11.990
Let's go pick our boxes.

00:31:20.020 --> 00:31:21.150
Ms. Hu! Ms. Hu!

00:31:21.270 --> 00:31:22.270
Ms. Hu, let's go together.

00:31:22.270 --> 00:31:23.270
Rongcheng is too dangerous.

00:31:23.270 --> 00:31:23.510
No need.

00:31:23.510 --> 00:31:24.870
Let's not get separated.

00:31:24.870 --> 00:31:25.400
It's fine.

00:31:25.400 --> 00:31:26.000
No need.

00:31:26.740 --> 00:31:27.540
I'm sorry.

00:31:39.960 --> 00:31:40.680
What?

00:31:41.160 --> 00:31:43.490
Is this a welcome gift for me
in Rongcheng?

00:31:54.980 --> 00:31:55.870
Why is it you?

00:31:56.880 --> 00:31:57.940
You're surprised?

00:31:59.200 --> 00:31:59.960
This is my wife.

00:31:59.960 --> 00:32:00.960
I haven't been able to keep her in line.

00:32:00.960 --> 00:32:01.760
My apologies.

00:32:11.710 --> 00:32:12.510
Mr. Qian.

00:32:12.960 --> 00:32:14.590
Reporter Han Yingzhi and Mr. Miyazaki

00:32:14.590 --> 00:32:15.720
are indeed married,

00:32:15.720 --> 00:32:17.480
but it's a fake marriage.

00:32:17.720 --> 00:32:18.440
I understand.

00:32:18.440 --> 00:32:19.770
Like Mr. and Mrs. Smith.

00:32:20.270 --> 00:32:21.400
Though compared to Angelina Jolie,

00:32:21.400 --> 00:32:23.030
you're missing

00:32:23.180 --> 00:32:25.210
a little bit of that sexy factor.

00:32:25.640 --> 00:32:27.030
Although we're on different sides,

00:32:27.030 --> 00:32:28.790
the people we're up against are the same,

00:32:28.790 --> 00:32:29.350
right?

00:32:29.350 --> 00:32:31.080
Let me see your character card.

00:32:31.160 --> 00:32:32.160
-Let me see.
-Xiu.

00:32:35.030 --> 00:32:35.560
How is it?

00:32:36.180 --> 00:32:36.830
Not bad.

00:32:37.800 --> 00:32:38.510
Guy,

00:32:39.160 --> 00:32:40.220
it's getting late.

00:32:40.530 --> 00:32:41.930
Let's head into the city.

00:32:42.940 --> 00:32:43.580
Let's go.

00:32:43.750 --> 00:32:44.400
Let's go.

00:32:45.000 --> 00:32:45.460
Please.

00:33:00.150 --> 00:33:01.830
Well, well, well, Reporter Han,

00:33:01.830 --> 00:33:03.960
I've heard so much about you.

00:33:04.930 --> 00:33:05.990
What's my mission?

00:33:08.260 --> 00:33:09.190
I need you

00:33:09.210 --> 00:33:10.350
to get close to Qin Xiaoyi

00:33:10.350 --> 00:33:11.680
under the pretense of an interview

00:33:11.680 --> 00:33:13.760
and steal his pocket watch.

00:33:14.550 --> 00:33:15.350
Pocket watch?

00:33:15.570 --> 00:33:17.960
I found a very important lead.

00:33:18.200 --> 00:33:20.920
Qin Xiaoyi's father
was an economic criminal.

00:33:20.970 --> 00:33:22.940
That pocket watch is his heirloom.

00:33:23.750 --> 00:33:25.920
Once we expose his background,

00:33:25.940 --> 00:33:29.020
he'll be finished.

00:33:38.640 --> 00:33:39.840
Don't rush.

00:33:39.950 --> 00:33:42.080
He's at the theater. He can't get away.

00:33:44.360 --> 00:33:45.150
Ms. Hu!

00:33:45.750 --> 00:33:46.400
Ms. Hu!

00:33:46.680 --> 00:33:47.200
Ms. Hu!

00:33:48.110 --> 00:33:48.920
Ms. Hu.

00:33:49.430 --> 00:33:51.290
Looks like I wasn't mistaken earlier.

00:33:51.290 --> 00:33:52.620
You did go to the casino.

00:33:53.160 --> 00:33:53.880
Ms. Hu,

00:33:54.310 --> 00:33:55.480
as a young woman,

00:33:55.510 --> 00:33:56.860
it's not really appropriate for you

00:33:56.860 --> 00:33:58.680
to keep going to places like that.

00:33:58.680 --> 00:33:59.550
Mr. Qian,

00:33:59.570 --> 00:34:01.770
in Rongcheng, players can go anywhere.

00:34:01.920 --> 00:34:02.830
I understand.

00:34:03.070 --> 00:34:04.550
Then let me take you somewhere fun.

00:34:04.550 --> 00:34:06.210
No thanks, I've got a mission.

00:34:07.450 --> 00:34:08.489
It's just nearby.

00:34:09.510 --> 00:34:10.909
When I passed by earlier,

00:34:10.920 --> 00:34:12.230
I saw a clothing store.

00:34:12.880 --> 00:34:13.719
Actually,

00:34:13.760 --> 00:34:15.150
I wanted to tell you this

00:34:15.150 --> 00:34:16.760
right after we got off the train.

00:34:16.760 --> 00:34:18.190
The outfit you picked

00:34:18.620 --> 00:34:21.230
is a bit outdated.

00:34:21.840 --> 00:34:22.760
But it's okay.

00:34:23.070 --> 00:34:24.730
We can get you something else.

00:34:25.000 --> 00:34:26.630
Girls like you

00:34:27.070 --> 00:34:29.280
should wear pretty dresses.

00:34:31.239 --> 00:34:32.630
I know that store.

00:34:33.230 --> 00:34:34.400
But it doesn't sell clothes—

00:34:34.400 --> 00:34:35.360
it sells identities.

00:34:35.360 --> 00:34:36.630
But a new identity is too expensive.

00:34:36.630 --> 00:34:37.880
I don't have that money.

00:34:37.880 --> 00:34:39.480
Who says we don't have money?

00:34:40.370 --> 00:34:41.690
I have plenty.

00:34:42.290 --> 00:34:43.620
When we entered the game,

00:34:43.620 --> 00:34:45.460
Mr. Guangming gave me his props.

00:34:46.030 --> 00:34:47.440
He's just too kind.

00:34:47.760 --> 00:34:49.110
It's just a game,

00:34:49.230 --> 00:34:50.710
yet he takes such good care of me.

00:34:50.710 --> 00:34:52.320
Someone as reliable as him—

00:34:52.560 --> 00:34:55.080
his company is bound to succeed.

00:34:55.389 --> 00:34:57.250
Wang is in the early stage of his startup.

00:34:57.250 --> 00:34:59.190
I want to provide all the support I can,

00:34:59.190 --> 00:35:00.360
and help him secure

00:35:00.360 --> 00:35:01.710
any potential clients.

00:35:02.710 --> 00:35:04.370
Alright, let's go take a look.

00:35:04.850 --> 00:35:05.780
This way, Ms. Hu.

00:35:09.930 --> 00:35:10.700
Welcome.

00:35:14.130 --> 00:35:14.880
How about this one?

00:35:14.880 --> 00:35:16.680
A young lady who studied abroad.

00:35:21.020 --> 00:35:22.060
This one's nice.

00:35:22.230 --> 00:35:23.280
A nurse.

00:35:23.610 --> 00:35:25.740
Saving lives and helping the wounded.

00:35:29.070 --> 00:35:30.000
This looks good.

00:35:31.720 --> 00:35:33.190
When playing this kind of game,

00:35:33.190 --> 00:35:34.420
you need to wear clothes like these.

00:35:34.420 --> 00:35:35.820
That's what makes it fun,

00:35:36.360 --> 00:35:36.880
right?

00:35:38.210 --> 00:35:39.410
Just a moment, Ms. Hu.

00:35:42.000 --> 00:35:42.730
Try this one.

00:35:43.400 --> 00:35:44.230
Size S.

00:35:44.860 --> 00:35:45.840
A qipao

00:35:45.840 --> 00:35:47.150
is meant to show the curves.

00:35:47.150 --> 00:35:48.880
That's what makes it look good.

00:36:00.000 --> 00:36:00.760
Mr. Qian.

00:36:01.200 --> 00:36:02.630
When I came in just now,

00:36:03.070 --> 00:36:04.070
I noticed

00:36:04.070 --> 00:36:06.280
an indigo suit on that rack.

00:36:06.630 --> 00:36:07.550
It's just as good as any big brand

00:36:07.550 --> 00:36:08.750
and really suits you.

00:36:09.950 --> 00:36:11.360
Why don't you try it on?

00:36:12.060 --> 00:36:14.820
If you wear it, you'll totally
outshine all the other players.

00:36:14.820 --> 00:36:15.900
Really?

00:36:16.630 --> 00:36:18.230
Alright, I'll go take a look.

00:36:20.590 --> 00:36:22.900
All of our suits
are made with the finest fabrics,

00:36:22.900 --> 00:36:24.960
and the craftsmanship is excellent.

00:36:27.260 --> 00:36:28.010
Ms. Hu,

00:36:28.400 --> 00:36:30.330
which suit were you talking about?

00:36:31.370 --> 00:36:32.120
Ms. Hu?

00:36:34.960 --> 00:36:35.670
Ms. Hu?

00:37:06.220 --> 00:37:08.820
Reporter Han,
what brings you to a movie today?

00:37:15.090 --> 00:37:16.550
I'm here for an interview.

00:37:17.000 --> 00:37:17.730
That's rare.

00:37:18.440 --> 00:37:19.320
Rare how?

00:37:19.990 --> 00:37:22.550
I invited you
to the military office for an interview,

00:37:22.550 --> 00:37:25.110
but you ignored me for days,
Miss Reporter.

00:37:30.960 --> 00:37:32.630
What invitation?

00:37:32.940 --> 00:37:36.440
It clearly says here that Reporter Han
requested a meeting with Qin Xiaoyi.

00:37:36.440 --> 00:37:38.910
When has Qin Xiaoyi
ever been the one to reach out first?

00:37:38.910 --> 00:37:40.440
Let's start, Reporter Han.

00:37:42.060 --> 00:37:43.140
General Qin,

00:37:43.160 --> 00:37:45.840
don't you need
to check my press credentials first?

00:37:45.840 --> 00:37:46.590
No need.

00:37:49.070 --> 00:37:51.070
It's pitch-dark in this theater.

00:37:51.070 --> 00:37:53.320
You can't even see my face clearly,

00:37:53.510 --> 00:37:55.710
and you're not
confirming my identity either.

00:37:55.710 --> 00:37:57.950
Aren't you afraid
I'm using the title of reporter

00:37:57.950 --> 00:37:59.360
to do something shady?

00:38:03.460 --> 00:38:05.580
I never allow anyone I don't trust

00:38:05.700 --> 00:38:06.940
to come near me.

00:38:08.410 --> 00:38:10.140
As a member of the project team,

00:38:10.230 --> 00:38:12.190
you should keep a distance from them.

00:38:12.190 --> 00:38:13.280
During this project,

00:38:13.280 --> 00:38:15.520
it's best to stay away from their people.

00:38:15.520 --> 00:38:17.780
The competition for the mayor is fierce.

00:38:17.880 --> 00:38:19.590
Aren't you afraid that one day

00:38:19.590 --> 00:38:21.760
someone close to you
might be bought off by your rivals,

00:38:21.760 --> 00:38:23.480
or tricked into
leaking critical information,

00:38:23.480 --> 00:38:25.680
ruining everything at the last moment?

00:38:26.320 --> 00:38:27.360
So, Mr. Xiao,

00:38:28.200 --> 00:38:30.240
you came to the site

00:38:30.260 --> 00:38:31.790
because you don't trust me?

00:38:36.480 --> 00:38:37.070
No.

00:38:38.360 --> 00:38:40.000
Everyone around me is smart.

00:38:41.190 --> 00:38:42.280
And she knows

00:38:42.710 --> 00:38:43.970
who will win in the end.

00:38:54.190 --> 00:38:55.630
Reporter Han,
you've finished all your questions.

00:38:55.630 --> 00:38:56.960
Now I have a few of my own.

00:38:57.920 --> 00:38:59.400
Are you and Mr. Miyazaki

00:38:59.420 --> 00:39:00.380
very close?

00:39:02.440 --> 00:39:03.770
Why are you asking that?

00:39:04.860 --> 00:39:07.230
I saw you two
sticking together at the city gate.

00:39:07.230 --> 00:39:08.650
Even between husband and wife,

00:39:08.650 --> 00:39:10.220
the husband doesn't always

00:39:10.250 --> 00:39:11.850
stand on the wife's side—

00:39:12.150 --> 00:39:13.630
let alone a fake marriage.

00:39:14.510 --> 00:39:15.190
I've known for a long time

00:39:15.190 --> 00:39:16.880
that he's not on my side.

00:39:17.110 --> 00:39:18.680
Sooner or later, he'll betray me.

00:39:18.680 --> 00:39:19.610
So, why do you...

00:39:19.860 --> 00:39:21.460
I'm doing this for my friend.

00:39:21.730 --> 00:39:23.510
My friend has business to discuss

00:39:23.510 --> 00:39:24.590
with Mr. Miyazaki.

00:39:24.850 --> 00:39:26.950
Otherwise,
I wouldn't bother dealing with him at all.

00:39:26.950 --> 00:39:28.800
Your friend needs to rely on him?

00:39:29.000 --> 00:39:29.710
It seems

00:39:29.800 --> 00:39:31.530
his career is doing quite well.

00:39:31.650 --> 00:39:33.650
I don't know how his career is going,

00:39:33.650 --> 00:39:34.700
but as a person,

00:39:35.360 --> 00:39:36.320
he's just questionable, to say the least.

00:39:36.320 --> 00:39:38.480
He doesn't even know what manners are,

00:39:38.590 --> 00:39:40.660
and he doesn't
follow Rongcheng's rules either.

00:39:40.660 --> 00:39:41.880
Don't let me run into him again.

00:39:41.880 --> 00:39:43.030
Otherwise, I won't be able to stop myself
from hitting him.

00:39:43.030 --> 00:39:45.230
Then things will get ugly for everyone.

00:39:45.280 --> 00:39:45.950
Okay.

00:39:48.550 --> 00:39:49.240
What?

00:39:50.790 --> 00:39:52.190
I won't let you run into him.
