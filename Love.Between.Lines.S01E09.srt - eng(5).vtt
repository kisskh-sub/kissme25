I might not know how his career is going,

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:00.480
but his character

00:02:00.480 --> 00:02:01.790
leaves much to be desired.

00:02:01.790 --> 00:02:04.200
He doesn't even know basic courtesy.

00:02:04.630 --> 00:02:06.740
He won't follow Rongcheng's rules.

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:08.680
I'd better not run into him again,

00:02:08.680 --> 00:02:09.870
or I won't be able to stop myself
from lashing out,

00:02:09.870 --> 00:02:11.800
and everyone will be embarrassed.

Alright. (Support Admin Watch on

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:19.130
I won't let you run into him.

Try this candied fruit.

It's delicious.

I picked it up along the way.

00:02:46.829 --> 00:02:48.670
I can no longer accept your gifts,

I'm not being kind.

I won't marry you just because of a hat.

00:02:58.280 --> 00:02:59.380
Don't get ahead of yourself.

00:02:59.380 --> 00:03:00.470
I will not marry.

00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:03.460
Then I won't kiss you either.

00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:16.640
I almost forgot about
the real matters at hand.

00:03:17.079 --> 00:03:18.610
No, I don't want to kiss you,

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:20.530
even though you may need it.

00:03:20.670 --> 00:03:21.800
That is the problem.

You need someone

Then, do you think you're that person?

Watch where you're going!

Keep staring

00:03:37.640 --> 00:03:39.770
and I'll file a complaint against you!

00:04:02.520 --> 00:04:03.550
What's wrong?

00:04:04.390 --> 00:04:06.050
Is there something on my face?

but complain about the hawthorn balls.

00:04:31.030 --> 00:04:31.760
Don't panic.

Let's go.

00:04:42.960 --> 00:04:44.960
Chief Ning has lost important evidence.

00:04:44.960 --> 00:04:46.760
Everyone must be searched.

00:04:46.760 --> 00:04:48.760
Why are you hiding from Ning Zechen?

00:04:49.470 --> 00:04:50.120
Follow me.

00:04:51.960 --> 00:04:52.690
Hand it over.

00:05:00.640 --> 00:05:02.170

This way.

00:05:09.270 --> 00:05:10.790
Where does this path lead?

00:05:11.680 --> 00:05:12.610
To the main hall.

00:05:12.790 --> 00:05:14.250
It's one of the fire exits.

I'll need to prepare for
the mayor's election too.

00:05:33.680 --> 00:05:35.000
Well then, General Qin,

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:35.909
farewell.

00:05:37.200 --> 00:05:37.730
Alright.

00:05:40.760 --> 00:05:41.290
General!

00:05:42.470 --> 00:05:43.200
It's no good.

Mr. Guangming,

before I came here, I heard that

the NPCs here are all very good-looking.

00:08:34.470 --> 00:08:36.400
Lots of women spend money on them.

But I never expected

Ms. Hu is also such a person.

She went shopping with me today.

00:08:50.390 --> 00:08:52.890
At first, she even complimented
how handsome I looked in my suit.

00:08:52.890 --> 00:08:54.990
Then suddenly, she was flirting
with someone else.

00:08:54.990 --> 00:08:55.750
She's just a woman

00:08:55.750 --> 00:08:58.150
who only cares about looks, not character.

00:08:58.350 --> 00:08:59.680
I really misjudged her.

What do you mean by that?

00:09:08.350 --> 00:09:10.800
It's your friend who has
questionable character.

I saw it with my own eyes.

00:09:11.960 --> 00:09:13.560

other male actors.

00:10:33.550 --> 00:10:34.110
♪ It felt as if two lonely islands
had finally ♪

00:10:34.110 --> 00:10:34.710
try gripping my hand.

00:10:34.710 --> 00:10:36.040
Can you apply pressure?

00:10:39.480 --> 00:10:41.230
♪ Getting closer and slipped into
the flow of time together ♪

00:10:41.230 --> 00:10:42.400
I'm okay.

00:10:42.800 --> 00:10:45.060
You're messing up my gaming experience!

00:10:45.590 --> 00:10:45.960
I'm sorry.

00:10:45.960 --> 00:10:46.350
I can't continue anymore.

00:10:46.350 --> 00:10:47.880
Give us an explanation now!

00:10:50.440 --> 00:10:51.400
Don't touch me!

00:10:51.400 --> 00:10:52.320
What should we do?

00:10:52.320 --> 00:10:52.710
Let's call the police.

00:10:52.710 --> 00:10:53.560
All's good now.

00:10:53.560 --> 00:10:54.800
Why call the police?

00:10:55.160 --> 00:10:55.990
If this gets out,

00:10:55.990 --> 00:10:58.080
it won't look good for our club.

00:10:58.080 --> 00:11:00.080
Arrange full refunds for this session.

00:11:00.080 --> 00:11:01.280
Take down everyone's information.

00:11:01.280 --> 00:11:03.480
Everyone gets 30% off their next visit.

00:11:03.560 --> 00:11:06.870
Do you... have the authority
to make that decision?

00:11:07.040 --> 00:11:08.160
In my opinion,

00:11:08.160 --> 00:11:09.350
we should contact our boss first.

00:11:09.350 --> 00:11:10.280
Yes, yes.

00:11:10.280 --> 00:11:10.800
Let's contact our boss.

00:11:10.800 --> 00:11:11.800
I am the boss.

00:11:21.800 --> 00:11:22.830
How is your face?

00:11:22.830 --> 00:11:23.890
Does it still hurt?

00:11:24.080 --> 00:11:25.160
It's fine.

00:11:26.040 --> 00:11:27.440
You'd definitely slapped him back harder

00:11:27.440 --> 00:11:28.770
than what I had endured.

00:11:29.590 --> 00:11:30.750
It's his mouth.

00:11:30.750 --> 00:11:31.400
He can say

00:11:31.400 --> 00:11:32.280
whatever he wants.

00:11:32.280 --> 00:11:33.630
But I couldn't stand it.

00:11:34.110 --> 00:11:35.560
He was being so rude.

00:11:37.320 --> 00:11:38.630
Is that Qin Xiaoyi

00:11:38.660 --> 00:11:40.260
really the boss of this shop?

00:11:41.320 --> 00:11:42.160
If...

00:11:42.350 --> 00:11:43.320
he says so himself,

00:11:43.320 --> 00:11:44.800
then he must be.

00:11:44.900 --> 00:11:47.560
He keeps a much lower profile than
Gong Huaicong.

00:11:47.560 --> 00:11:48.800
You should go check on him quickly.

00:11:48.800 --> 00:11:51.060
I think he's in much worse shape
than I am.

00:11:51.160 --> 00:11:51.870
But...

00:11:52.230 --> 00:11:53.630
No buts.

00:11:53.630 --> 00:11:55.050
Wang is here with me.

00:11:55.070 --> 00:11:56.330
He will take care of me.

00:11:57.110 --> 00:11:58.320
Use this to ice it first.

00:11:58.320 --> 00:12:00.230
We'll use an ice pack when we get home.

00:12:00.230 --> 00:12:00.750
I'm sorry

00:12:00.750 --> 00:12:02.200
for causing you trouble today.

00:12:02.200 --> 00:12:03.200
I'm fine.

00:12:03.200 --> 00:12:04.400
I'll go check on Xiao—

00:12:05.160 --> 00:12:06.210
Qin Xiaoyi.

00:12:09.870 --> 00:12:12.640
All the players for this session
have been refunded.

00:12:12.640 --> 00:12:13.410
Wait.

00:12:13.480 --> 00:12:14.700
I can't believe I wasn't there

00:12:14.700 --> 00:12:16.230
for such a dramatic moment.

00:12:19.630 --> 00:12:21.080
I have to go now. Bye.

00:12:23.230 --> 00:12:24.400
You were waiting for me?

00:12:24.400 --> 00:12:26.200
I'll go to the hospital with you.

00:12:28.710 --> 00:12:29.830
You must get checked out.

00:12:29.830 --> 00:12:31.360
What if something's wrong?

00:12:32.390 --> 00:12:33.920
I didn't say I wasn't going.

00:12:34.230 --> 00:12:36.760
Architects don't mess around with
their own hands.

00:12:36.760 --> 00:12:38.220
Good that you understand.

00:12:38.630 --> 00:12:39.680
Let's go.

00:12:45.770 --> 00:12:46.430
[Emergency]

00:12:49.830 --> 00:12:50.560
We're here.

00:12:59.080 --> 00:12:59.610
Let's go.

00:13:00.590 --> 00:13:01.710
Alright.

00:13:01.850 --> 00:13:02.850
I hurt my arm,

00:13:02.880 --> 00:13:03.710
not my leg.

00:13:03.750 --> 00:13:05.280
I can still walk.

00:13:06.630 --> 00:13:07.890
Let's register first.

00:13:08.350 --> 00:13:08.830
Hello.

00:13:08.830 --> 00:13:10.280
My friend hurt his arm.

00:13:10.280 --> 00:13:11.230
How do we get to the clinic?

00:13:11.230 --> 00:13:12.160
Register first.

00:13:15.160 --> 00:13:15.920
Doctor.

00:13:15.920 --> 00:13:17.110
My friend injured his hand.

00:13:17.110 --> 00:13:17.730
I need to register.

00:13:17.730 --> 00:13:19.190
10 yuan for registration.

00:13:23.440 --> 00:13:24.440
Here's your card.

00:13:24.800 --> 00:13:25.330
Let's go.

00:13:28.950 --> 00:13:30.080
Can you bend it here?

00:13:31.110 --> 00:13:32.560
Gently, please!

00:13:35.250 --> 00:13:37.340
Your girlfriend seems quite concerned
about you.

00:13:37.340 --> 00:13:39.140
She's crying out in pain for you.

00:13:39.400 --> 00:13:40.400
Doctor, you misunderstood.

00:13:40.400 --> 00:13:40.800
I...

00:13:40.800 --> 00:13:41.990
We're not together.

00:13:42.240 --> 00:13:43.670
Doctor, is it serious?

00:13:44.990 --> 00:13:45.720
I'm not sure.

00:13:45.720 --> 00:13:47.180
Let's take an X-ray first.

00:13:48.110 --> 00:13:48.710
Oh, X-ray.

00:13:49.340 --> 00:13:50.080
Take him there first.

00:13:50.080 --> 00:13:51.060
It's on the second floor, right?

00:13:51.060 --> 00:13:51.650
Let's go.

00:13:51.670 --> 00:13:52.270
Thank you.

00:13:58.590 --> 00:14:00.630
Doctor, what's the diagnosis?

00:14:03.590 --> 00:14:04.750
I-Is it serious?

00:14:06.910 --> 00:14:07.840
The bone is fine.

00:14:07.870 --> 00:14:10.230
There's soft tissue contusion
with bruising.

00:14:10.230 --> 00:14:10.990
That's why

00:14:10.990 --> 00:14:11.920
this area

00:14:11.920 --> 00:14:12.990
is swollen.

00:14:14.110 --> 00:14:15.240
So what should we do?

00:14:15.510 --> 00:14:16.320
It's not serious.

00:14:16.320 --> 00:14:18.050
I'll prescribe some medicine.

00:14:18.400 --> 00:14:19.000
Remember,

00:14:19.400 --> 00:14:21.680
absolutely no spicy food or seafood.

00:14:21.680 --> 00:14:22.560
And this hand,

00:14:22.590 --> 00:14:23.850
don't strain it and keep movement minimal.

00:14:23.850 --> 00:14:24.790
Thank you, doctor.

00:14:24.790 --> 00:14:25.720
You're welcome.

00:14:45.160 --> 00:14:45.800
Let me see.

00:14:47.800 --> 00:14:48.800
It's much better.

00:14:51.440 --> 00:14:52.800
Did that project fall through?

00:14:52.800 --> 00:14:54.110
Don't mention the project.

00:14:54.110 --> 00:14:55.590
Who would work with someone like that?

00:14:55.590 --> 00:14:57.120
He'll fail sooner or later.

00:14:57.370 --> 00:14:58.100
That's true.

00:14:58.260 --> 00:14:59.920
Consider it dodging a bullet.

00:15:02.440 --> 00:15:03.080
Let's eat.

00:15:06.320 --> 00:15:07.080
Let's go.

00:15:12.510 --> 00:15:13.110
How is it?

00:15:13.110 --> 00:15:14.770
These are all your favorites.

00:15:15.990 --> 00:15:16.590
It's good.

00:15:16.960 --> 00:15:17.590
It's good?

00:15:30.040 --> 00:15:30.840
What's wrong?

00:15:33.160 --> 00:15:35.890
Mr. Qu wants me to attend
a technical conference.

00:15:36.560 --> 00:15:37.510
Is it far?

00:15:37.830 --> 00:15:38.710
Jinshan.

00:15:40.050 --> 00:15:41.170
That's not too bad.

00:15:41.190 --> 00:15:42.990
At least it's still in Shanghai.

00:15:49.350 --> 00:15:50.110
Let's eat.

00:15:55.200 --> 00:15:55.800
By the way,

00:15:56.230 --> 00:15:56.920
tomorrow,

00:15:57.000 --> 00:15:58.390
remember to transfer

00:15:58.470 --> 00:16:00.200
the medical expenses to Hu Xiu.

00:16:00.990 --> 00:16:01.750
I'll ask her tomorrow.

00:16:01.750 --> 00:16:03.210
She must be quite busy now.

00:16:08.320 --> 00:16:10.320
The dosage and instructions are
clearly stated on the labels.

00:16:10.320 --> 00:16:11.440
Make sure to take them on time.

00:16:11.440 --> 00:16:13.040
Call me if you need anything.

00:16:13.080 --> 00:16:13.990
Get down first.

00:16:13.990 --> 00:16:15.440
I'll go park the car.

00:16:15.990 --> 00:16:16.920
You've been busy all night.

00:16:16.920 --> 00:16:17.980
Aren't you hungry?

00:16:18.870 --> 00:16:20.200
I... I'm fine.

00:16:27.110 --> 00:16:27.800
I'm hungry.

00:16:29.300 --> 00:16:30.360
Let's go upstairs.

00:16:44.390 --> 00:16:45.060
Mr. Xiao,

00:16:45.280 --> 00:16:47.230
my cooking skills aren't that great.

00:16:47.230 --> 00:16:49.560
You're still better than me with one hand.

00:16:50.160 --> 00:16:50.710
Well then,

00:16:50.710 --> 00:16:52.170
what would you like to eat?

00:16:52.440 --> 00:16:53.520
Check the fridge

00:16:53.550 --> 00:16:54.750
and see what's there.

00:17:04.359 --> 00:17:05.359
What's this?

00:17:06.310 --> 00:17:08.569
I don't like taking advantage of others.

00:17:09.440 --> 00:17:10.510
So over here, you're figuring out

00:17:10.510 --> 00:17:12.160
how to keep live crabs fresh?

00:17:12.710 --> 00:17:13.680
At least for now,

00:17:13.680 --> 00:17:15.020
they seem to be holding up pretty well.

00:17:15.020 --> 00:17:16.020
Are they alive?

00:17:21.480 --> 00:17:22.160
It might still be alive,

00:17:22.160 --> 00:17:24.089
but you nearly smashed it to death.

00:17:35.100 --> 00:17:36.230
By the way, Mr. Xiao,

00:17:36.360 --> 00:17:38.510
you already got evidence of
Ning Zechen's smuggling.

00:17:38.510 --> 00:17:39.360
So why didn't you

00:17:39.360 --> 00:17:41.160
go straight to the mayor for
a command token

00:17:41.160 --> 00:17:42.660
and then enter the election?

00:17:42.660 --> 00:17:44.590
Why come to the dance hall instead?

00:17:49.840 --> 00:17:51.900
I was planning to give you this watch.

00:17:53.550 --> 00:17:54.400
You trusted me

00:17:54.750 --> 00:17:56.330
and gave me the smuggling evidence.

00:17:56.330 --> 00:17:57.510
So of course, I should give you
something in return

00:17:57.510 --> 00:17:58.840
to put your mind at ease.

00:17:59.090 --> 00:18:01.550
That's what mutual trust is about,
isn't it?

00:18:03.440 --> 00:18:05.550
You're so smooth-talking now.

00:18:05.550 --> 00:18:07.010
Where was all this before?

00:18:14.270 --> 00:18:15.870
On that day of the site visit,

00:18:15.880 --> 00:18:17.550
it wasn't that I didn't trust you.

00:18:17.550 --> 00:18:18.880
I didn't trust Zhuling.

00:18:19.400 --> 00:18:20.710
I have no idea what they might do

00:18:20.710 --> 00:18:22.040
to achieve their goals.

00:18:25.200 --> 00:18:26.120
So...

00:18:26.750 --> 00:18:28.230
you weren't being suspicious,

00:18:28.230 --> 00:18:29.030
but...

00:18:29.270 --> 00:18:30.400
you were concerned?

00:18:34.710 --> 00:18:36.160
Concern for an employee?

00:18:37.160 --> 00:18:38.560
You could put it that way.

00:18:42.810 --> 00:18:43.850
Don't worry,

00:18:43.880 --> 00:18:45.080
I won't betray you.

00:22:02.680 --> 00:22:04.280

00:22:52.960 --> 00:22:53.680
Mr. Xiao,

00:22:54.390 --> 00:22:55.790
I brought you breakfast.

00:22:57.550 --> 00:22:58.150
Thank you.

00:23:04.990 --> 00:23:06.160
How's your hand?

00:23:07.200 --> 00:23:08.400
It doesn't hurt as much anymore,

00:23:08.400 --> 00:23:10.000
but it's still a bit swollen.

00:23:13.200 --> 00:23:14.070
What's this?

00:23:15.440 --> 00:23:17.600
I saw your fridge was almost empty,

00:23:17.670 --> 00:23:19.400
so I bought some instant meals.

00:23:20.120 --> 00:23:21.550
You just need to heat them up,

00:23:21.550 --> 00:23:23.480
so you don't have to cook yourself.

00:23:27.400 --> 00:23:28.270
Let me do it.

00:23:30.340 --> 00:23:33.400
I'm not completely incapable of
taking care of myself.

00:23:35.640 --> 00:23:36.160
Here.

00:23:37.470 --> 00:23:37.960
Take it.

00:23:39.510 --> 00:23:40.030
Thanks.

00:23:41.550 --> 00:23:42.200
Mr. Xiao,

00:23:42.400 --> 00:23:44.330
I can drive you to the office today.

00:23:45.820 --> 00:23:48.120
Isn't Xiao He on a business trip
with Ms. Zhou?

00:23:48.120 --> 00:23:50.720
I see your hands aren't
in a condition to drive.

00:24:14.310 --> 00:24:15.230
Looking at this background,

00:24:15.230 --> 00:24:17.960
it's that murder mystery game shop
in the industrial park?

00:24:17.960 --> 00:24:19.120
I heard there was a woman

00:24:19.120 --> 00:24:20.700
who cheated with an NPC from the shop,

00:24:20.700 --> 00:24:22.200
so the man in the video was very angry

00:24:22.200 --> 00:24:23.440
and wanted to catch the adulterer.

00:24:23.440 --> 00:24:25.680
I heard it was a love triangle.

00:24:25.680 --> 00:24:26.990
One of these women is the current partner,

00:24:26.990 --> 00:24:28.650
and the other is the mistress.

00:24:29.210 --> 00:24:30.080
Is that for real?

00:24:30.080 --> 00:24:30.950
That's scary.

00:24:30.980 --> 00:24:32.190
You should have seen

00:24:32.680 --> 00:24:34.070
that girl called Hu Xiu.

00:24:34.070 --> 00:24:36.120
She went straight up
and slapped that jerk.

00:24:36.120 --> 00:24:37.710
Although she's scared of ghosts,

00:24:37.710 --> 00:24:39.840
she sure isn't afraid to charge at people.

00:24:39.840 --> 00:24:42.310
The one who's in trouble should be
Qin Xiaoyi from Group A.

00:24:42.310 --> 00:24:42.990
I think

00:24:42.990 --> 00:24:45.510
we should call our Second Boss now.

00:24:46.660 --> 00:24:48.320
That statue was really heavy.

00:24:48.470 --> 00:24:50.870
His hand must be
at least slightly injured.

00:24:52.840 --> 00:24:54.100
Qin Xiaoyi is injured?

00:24:54.510 --> 00:24:56.230
But it shouldn't be too serious.

00:24:56.230 --> 00:24:56.790
Boss,

00:24:57.030 --> 00:24:59.290
have you seen the video in the group chat?

00:24:59.310 --> 00:25:00.110
I just saw it.

00:25:00.310 --> 00:25:02.440
The group is full of the park's regulars.

00:25:02.440 --> 00:25:03.750
If this spreads out,

00:25:03.750 --> 00:25:05.280
it would be terrible for us.

00:25:06.680 --> 00:25:07.270
How about

00:25:07.270 --> 00:25:09.160
we share the video of the Second Boss
saving someone

00:25:09.160 --> 00:25:09.750
instead?

00:25:09.750 --> 00:25:10.400
Nonsense.

00:25:12.270 --> 00:25:13.700
Remember this, all of you.

00:25:13.700 --> 00:25:15.980
Stop calling him "Second Boss"
from now on.

00:25:15.980 --> 00:25:17.870
Just treat him as Qin Xiaoyi.

00:25:18.270 --> 00:25:19.440
We'll be acting together again
in the future.

00:25:19.440 --> 00:25:21.370
Just be more natural, understand?

00:25:24.680 --> 00:25:25.120
Fei.

00:25:25.980 --> 00:25:27.710
Obtain the surveillance footage

00:25:27.710 --> 00:25:28.750
and show it to me.

00:25:31.710 --> 00:25:34.110
We are definitely not sharing it publicly.

00:25:34.310 --> 00:25:35.510
I'm just curious

00:25:36.270 --> 00:25:37.800
how he rescued that person.

00:25:38.160 --> 00:25:38.680
Okay.

00:25:44.160 --> 00:25:45.840
Hu Xiu and this girl

00:25:45.840 --> 00:25:48.230
went up and beat this guy together?

00:25:48.440 --> 00:25:49.640
They don't look like

00:25:49.640 --> 00:25:51.570
the current lover or the mistress.

00:25:52.160 --> 00:25:52.790
Mr. Gong.

00:25:53.440 --> 00:25:54.230
People in the group chat

00:25:54.230 --> 00:25:55.700
are just spreading rumors.

00:25:55.700 --> 00:25:56.360
This girl is

00:25:56.360 --> 00:25:56.790
Regard Café's

00:25:56.790 --> 00:25:57.600
Ms. Zhao.

00:25:57.600 --> 00:25:59.030
She's childhood friends with Hu Xiu.

00:25:59.030 --> 00:26:00.170
I know both of them.

00:26:00.550 --> 00:26:01.200
That Ms. Zhao,

00:26:01.200 --> 00:26:02.600
isn't she in the group chat?

00:26:02.600 --> 00:26:04.660
Why doesn't she come out and explain?

00:26:05.230 --> 00:26:05.920
Last night,

00:26:05.920 --> 00:26:06.920
many other players

00:26:06.920 --> 00:26:08.790
came to me complaining about
this Miyazaki guy,

00:26:08.790 --> 00:26:10.190
saying he has no manners.

00:26:10.230 --> 00:26:11.310
Why don't we help by

00:26:11.310 --> 00:26:12.520
saying something in the group chat?

00:26:12.520 --> 00:26:13.070
Wait a minute.

00:26:13.070 --> 00:26:13.550
Hold on.

00:26:13.840 --> 00:26:14.960
Since the people involved
haven't come forward,

00:26:14.960 --> 00:26:18.820
it's not appropriate for us to discuss
our client's private matters.

00:26:19.440 --> 00:26:20.700
He won't come forward.

00:26:21.380 --> 00:26:22.250
Why not?

00:26:22.960 --> 00:26:24.750
This guy is called Qian Jinxin.

00:26:24.990 --> 00:26:27.790
He's the new operations manager
of our industrial park.

00:26:27.790 --> 00:26:30.310
So many things happen in
Shanghai every day.

00:26:30.510 --> 00:26:32.690
Everyone's attention will shift quickly.

00:26:32.690 --> 00:26:34.680
I've got to save my dignity somehow,

00:26:34.680 --> 00:26:35.550
so that my little shop

00:26:35.550 --> 00:26:37.150
can continue to operate peacefully.

00:26:37.150 --> 00:26:38.680
Are we still asking for compensation?

00:26:38.680 --> 00:26:39.840
Ms. Zhao left her contact information

00:26:39.840 --> 00:26:41.260
and said to contact her when convenient.

00:26:41.260 --> 00:26:41.870
Forget it.

00:26:41.890 --> 00:26:43.230
It wasn't her fault anyway.

00:26:43.230 --> 00:26:44.070
Besides,

00:26:44.710 --> 00:26:45.640
she looks like someone

00:26:45.640 --> 00:26:47.030
you shouldn't mess with.

00:26:47.030 --> 00:26:48.400
Why should I cause trouble for myself

00:26:48.400 --> 00:26:50.060
over that little bit of money?

00:26:53.750 --> 00:26:54.710
It's no trouble.

00:26:55.220 --> 00:26:57.950
Mr. Gong, let's settle this
strictly by the book.

00:27:03.790 --> 00:27:04.460
Mr. Xiao,

00:27:05.230 --> 00:27:06.270
here's a document

00:27:06.270 --> 00:27:07.800
that needs your signature.

00:27:10.640 --> 00:27:10.990
Mr. Xiao,

00:27:10.990 --> 00:27:12.520
what happened to your hand?

00:27:12.910 --> 00:27:14.840
It's nothing. Just a minor injury.

00:27:18.270 --> 00:27:18.840
Mr. Xiao,

00:27:19.400 --> 00:27:19.750
your keys.

00:27:19.750 --> 00:27:20.840
Keep it with you for now.

00:27:20.840 --> 00:27:24.040
Until He returns, you're in charge of
ferrying me around.

00:27:25.990 --> 00:27:26.850
Anything else?

00:27:27.590 --> 00:27:28.390
No.

00:27:42.070 --> 00:27:43.660
Hu Xiu, you bought a car?

00:27:45.310 --> 00:27:45.830
No.

00:27:45.860 --> 00:27:47.530
I found a part-time job

00:27:48.000 --> 00:27:49.130
as a private driver.

00:27:49.600 --> 00:27:49.920
Well then,

00:27:49.920 --> 00:27:51.120
be careful out there.

00:27:58.920 --> 00:27:59.400
Zhao,

00:27:59.400 --> 00:28:00.440
where are you?

00:28:00.880 --> 00:28:02.810
Why did you close the shop so early?

00:28:02.880 --> 00:28:04.160
Xiu, I'm at home.

00:28:04.640 --> 00:28:06.270
Isn't Guangming on a business trip?

00:28:06.270 --> 00:28:07.800
Why did you go home so early?

00:28:08.200 --> 00:28:08.680
I even

00:28:08.680 --> 00:28:10.120
brought you your favorite late-night snack

00:28:10.120 --> 00:28:11.520
so we could eat together.

00:28:11.790 --> 00:28:13.450
Business was just okay today.

00:28:13.940 --> 00:28:15.540
I just wanted to take it easy.

00:28:15.550 --> 00:28:16.160
Alright.

00:28:16.160 --> 00:28:17.510
Get some rest then.

00:28:23.680 --> 00:28:24.600
Zhao, I've got something to do.

00:28:24.600 --> 00:28:25.530
I'll hang up now.

00:28:29.020 --> 00:28:30.820
Aren't you going to invite me in?

00:28:34.120 --> 00:28:35.030
Mr. Qian.

00:28:35.460 --> 00:28:37.660
please speak your mind.

00:28:38.070 --> 00:28:39.640
With you stomping all over the place,

00:28:39.640 --> 00:28:40.310
the floor will get dirty,

00:28:40.310 --> 00:28:41.900
and I'll have to mop it again.

00:28:41.900 --> 00:28:43.160
Ms. Hu, I heard that you

00:28:43.160 --> 00:28:44.290
live just upstairs.

00:28:44.980 --> 00:28:45.980
Who told you that?

00:28:47.510 --> 00:28:49.370
I happened to pass by a few days ago

00:28:49.680 --> 00:28:51.410
and saw the lights on upstairs.

00:28:52.360 --> 00:28:52.920
So I

00:28:52.920 --> 00:28:55.980
checked the industrial park's
entry and exit records.

00:28:57.390 --> 00:28:58.470
Yes, I live here.

00:28:58.490 --> 00:28:59.900
This is my friend's shop.

00:28:59.960 --> 00:29:01.550
She signed a contract with
the industrial park

00:29:01.550 --> 00:29:03.010
and had already paid rent.

00:29:03.030 --> 00:29:04.360
I'm just staying here temporarily.

00:29:04.360 --> 00:29:05.470
Is there a problem?

00:29:05.710 --> 00:29:08.030
Tenants cannot use commercial spaces
as residences.

00:29:08.030 --> 00:29:09.550
That's the industrial park's policy.

00:29:09.550 --> 00:29:11.420
Ms. Hu, up until today,

00:29:11.880 --> 00:29:14.470
you've been living here for
almost two months, right?

00:29:14.470 --> 00:29:16.760
If it were just two or three days,

00:29:16.780 --> 00:29:18.310
I could pretend not to know.

00:29:19.510 --> 00:29:20.920
But two months...

00:29:21.750 --> 00:29:23.610
that's a bit difficult to ignore.

00:29:25.230 --> 00:29:26.160
What do you want?

00:29:28.370 --> 00:29:30.160
I'm responsible for managing
this industrial park.

00:29:30.160 --> 00:29:32.110
I can't just know about it and
not report it, right?

00:29:32.110 --> 00:29:34.030
But if I report this...

00:29:34.640 --> 00:29:35.960
your friend's shop

00:29:36.780 --> 00:29:38.710
might be shut down for violations.

00:29:39.070 --> 00:29:39.840
However,

00:29:40.470 --> 00:29:42.880
rules are rigid, but we can be flexible.

00:29:42.880 --> 00:29:45.080
Since you now understand your mistake,

00:29:45.360 --> 00:29:47.510
if you just join me for dinner and drinks

00:29:47.510 --> 00:29:48.640
and apologize,

00:29:49.260 --> 00:29:50.350
perhaps I

00:29:50.370 --> 00:29:52.570
could turn a blind eye to this.

00:29:53.470 --> 00:29:54.160
No need.

00:29:54.880 --> 00:29:56.620
I'll move out as soon as possible.

00:29:56.620 --> 00:29:58.150
Please leave immediately.

00:30:01.490 --> 00:30:03.890
If you don't leave,
I'm calling the police.

00:30:17.970 --> 00:30:18.630
No problem.

00:30:18.640 --> 00:30:20.300
Let's proceed with this plan.

00:30:20.720 --> 00:30:22.600
The second draft was well coordinated.

00:30:22.600 --> 00:30:23.270
Now, the proposal

00:30:23.270 --> 00:30:24.610
is in its final stages of revision.

00:30:24.610 --> 00:30:26.140
We can't let our guard down.

00:30:30.510 --> 00:30:31.840
Is there anything else?

00:30:32.390 --> 00:30:33.030
Mr. Xiao,

00:30:33.920 --> 00:30:35.470
you just said

00:30:35.790 --> 00:30:37.160
this plan is now

00:30:37.160 --> 00:30:38.960
in its final stages of revision.

00:30:38.990 --> 00:30:40.400
Doesn't that mean many things

00:30:40.400 --> 00:30:42.160
have already been settled?

00:30:42.550 --> 00:30:44.470
So we might not need some...

00:30:44.920 --> 00:30:46.780
external inspiration to fuel it.

00:30:47.680 --> 00:30:49.280
Just say what's on your mind.

00:30:51.030 --> 00:30:52.160
Back then,

00:30:52.160 --> 00:30:53.960
didn't you move into the lane in search of

00:30:53.960 --> 00:30:55.690
inspiration for this project?

00:30:56.360 --> 00:30:57.920
So since this project

00:30:57.920 --> 00:30:59.600
is coming to an end now,

00:31:00.360 --> 00:31:03.080
isn't it about time you moved out?

00:31:04.740 --> 00:31:06.160
It hasn't been three months yet.

00:31:06.160 --> 00:31:06.980
According to the contract,

00:31:06.980 --> 00:31:08.700
I can stay as long as I want.

00:31:11.070 --> 00:31:13.600
Then can I move in and
share the place with you?

00:31:17.740 --> 00:31:20.200
I have to drive you
to and from work every day,

00:31:20.360 --> 00:31:22.290
which has doubled my commute time.

00:31:22.440 --> 00:31:23.510
You know very well

00:31:23.510 --> 00:31:24.840
how my hand got injured.

00:31:25.630 --> 00:31:27.550
Of course I know, Mr. Xiao.

00:31:28.630 --> 00:31:30.930
It's my responsibility to drive you
to and from work.

00:31:30.930 --> 00:31:32.130
I'm not running away.

00:31:32.750 --> 00:31:33.990
I'm just wondering if we could

00:31:33.990 --> 00:31:35.160
make things

00:31:35.250 --> 00:31:36.070
a little easier.

00:31:36.070 --> 00:31:36.750
No.

00:31:41.390 --> 00:31:42.080
Mr. Xiao,

00:31:42.100 --> 00:31:42.650
goodbye.

00:31:54.910 --> 00:31:55.970
What are you doing?

00:31:56.920 --> 00:31:57.600
As you all know,

00:31:57.600 --> 00:31:58.610
we once developed
a social media application

00:31:58.610 --> 00:31:59.470
[Software Innovation and Development
Technical Exchange Conference]

00:31:59.470 --> 00:32:02.400
which generated quite a bit of discussion.

00:32:02.680 --> 00:32:03.270
Well,

00:32:03.550 --> 00:32:05.840
the chain of trust issue in
anonymous social networking

00:32:05.840 --> 00:32:08.640
is sometimes like
the Byzantine Generals Problem.

00:32:08.640 --> 00:32:10.640
Users need to hide their identities

00:32:10.640 --> 00:32:12.480
while also establishing connections.

00:32:12.480 --> 00:32:13.240
Therefore,

00:32:13.310 --> 00:32:15.310
in this iteration we've introduced

00:32:15.310 --> 00:32:17.750
the concept of reinforcement learning
with weak ties.

00:32:17.750 --> 00:32:19.880
Let's explore this concept together.

00:32:24.660 --> 00:32:25.390
Guangming!

00:32:26.510 --> 00:32:27.160
Cheng Han.

00:32:29.160 --> 00:32:30.490
What are you doing here?

00:32:31.550 --> 00:32:32.550
What have you been up to
these past two years?

00:32:32.550 --> 00:32:33.960
We haven't heard anything from you.

00:32:33.960 --> 00:32:35.100
I'm just getting by.

00:32:35.160 --> 00:32:36.360
You're being modest again.

00:32:36.360 --> 00:32:37.200
I heard your

00:32:37.200 --> 00:32:38.930
entire presentation just now.

00:32:39.380 --> 00:32:40.100
So,

00:32:40.160 --> 00:32:41.600
when should we organize a class reunion?

00:32:41.600 --> 00:32:42.880
I haven't seen you for just two years,

00:32:42.880 --> 00:32:43.760
and it feels like

00:32:43.760 --> 00:32:45.220
we've grown a bit distant.

00:32:45.230 --> 00:32:45.710
Sure.

00:32:46.400 --> 00:32:46.840
By then, let's...

00:32:46.840 --> 00:32:47.600
Cheng Han.

00:32:50.110 --> 00:32:50.790
Senior.

00:32:53.100 --> 00:32:54.250
This is Chi Xin.

00:32:54.270 --> 00:32:56.040
She was in the same major as us
in college.

00:32:56.040 --> 00:32:58.910
I remember she was two years behind us,

00:32:58.950 --> 00:33:00.880
and now she's working at Zhiteng.

00:33:02.790 --> 00:33:03.600
Chi Xin?

00:33:04.820 --> 00:33:05.650
My fault.

00:33:06.050 --> 00:33:07.920
We took some general courses together,

00:33:07.920 --> 00:33:08.270
didn't we?

00:33:08.270 --> 00:33:08.750
Yes.

00:33:09.120 --> 00:33:09.790
It's been 7 years

00:33:09.790 --> 00:33:11.920
since we last met,
which was at your graduation.

00:33:11.920 --> 00:33:13.720
It's normal not to recognize me.

00:33:13.790 --> 00:33:15.440
Actually, you've become more beautiful,

00:33:15.440 --> 00:33:16.310
so it's no wonder

00:33:16.310 --> 00:33:17.030
we didn't recognize you.

00:33:17.030 --> 00:33:18.120
Senior, since we're from the same major,

00:33:18.120 --> 00:33:19.920
how about exchanging contacts?

00:33:22.700 --> 00:33:23.700
It's my wife.

00:33:23.990 --> 00:33:24.790
My wife's calling.

00:33:24.790 --> 00:33:26.120
You should take it then.

00:33:28.070 --> 00:33:28.550
Hi, honey.

00:33:28.550 --> 00:33:30.010
So, you are at Zhiteng now?

00:33:30.600 --> 00:33:32.030
I've been revising my speech

00:33:32.030 --> 00:33:33.550
from last night until this morning.

00:33:33.550 --> 00:33:34.510
Then, I just had to deal with

00:33:34.510 --> 00:33:36.020
a bunch of miscellaneous tasks,

00:33:36.020 --> 00:33:37.930
so I didn't have time to check my phone.

00:33:37.930 --> 00:33:38.530
By the way,

00:33:38.660 --> 00:33:40.310
I met two college classmates today.

00:33:40.310 --> 00:33:41.750
One you know, Cheng Han,

00:33:41.750 --> 00:33:43.210
my college roommate,

00:33:43.360 --> 00:33:44.580
and a junior female classmate

00:33:44.580 --> 00:33:46.580
who seems to be doing quite well now.

00:33:47.680 --> 00:33:49.680
It was quite a coincidence, anyway.

00:33:50.810 --> 00:33:51.370
Mr. Xiao,

00:33:51.640 --> 00:33:52.270
I thought

00:33:52.270 --> 00:33:54.190
it would be Mr. Gong signing it today.

00:33:54.190 --> 00:33:55.990
He had something urgent come up.

00:33:56.750 --> 00:33:58.470
Previously, I mentioned to Mr. Gong that

00:33:58.470 --> 00:33:59.360
the industrial park wants to

00:33:59.360 --> 00:34:01.080
collaborate with the club
on some marketing events.

00:34:01.080 --> 00:34:02.710
So when the proposal is ready,

00:34:02.710 --> 00:34:03.820
I'll send it to you.

00:34:03.850 --> 00:34:05.840
Just give it directly to Gong Huaicong.

00:34:05.840 --> 00:34:07.230
Okay, that works.

00:34:07.880 --> 00:34:09.070
No, let me treat you.

00:34:09.070 --> 00:34:10.150
It's okay, let me have it.

00:34:10.150 --> 00:34:10.670
No,

00:34:10.800 --> 00:34:11.469
Mr. Xiao,

00:34:11.469 --> 00:34:12.110
you see,

00:34:12.110 --> 00:34:14.670
our industrial park values the cooperation
with your club.

00:34:14.670 --> 00:34:16.360
Since you're willing to renew
for another two years,

00:34:16.360 --> 00:34:17.440
it's only fair

00:34:17.440 --> 00:34:18.770
that I should treat you.

00:34:18.840 --> 00:34:20.760
If the club has any needs in the future,

00:34:20.760 --> 00:34:21.690
just let us know.

00:34:23.239 --> 00:34:23.770
Alright.

00:34:23.900 --> 00:34:24.580
Hello,

00:34:24.600 --> 00:34:26.000
two Americanos, please.

00:34:32.880 --> 00:34:33.719
Mr. Xiao,

00:34:34.190 --> 00:34:36.080
the club must have quite a few employees.

00:34:36.080 --> 00:34:38.340
They don't live on the premises, do they?

00:34:38.350 --> 00:34:38.830
No,

00:34:38.980 --> 00:34:41.110
we've arranged dormitories for them.

00:34:41.179 --> 00:34:42.130
That's good.

00:34:42.550 --> 00:34:44.010
Is there something wrong?

00:34:44.139 --> 00:34:44.909
Nothing.

00:34:44.929 --> 00:34:46.590
It's good that you don't have that issue.

00:34:46.590 --> 00:34:48.190
How's it going? Is the coffee ready?

00:34:48.190 --> 00:34:48.790
Yes, it is.

00:34:54.070 --> 00:34:54.630
Ms. Hu,

00:34:55.070 --> 00:34:55.760
there are some things

00:34:55.760 --> 00:34:57.240
I need to tell you in advance.

00:34:57.240 --> 00:34:58.590
There are actually quite a few
residential complexes

00:34:58.590 --> 00:34:59.760
near our lane.

00:34:59.760 --> 00:35:01.550
But the budget you've given

00:35:01.550 --> 00:35:02.960
is truly on the low side.

00:35:03.880 --> 00:35:04.760
Moreover,

00:35:04.780 --> 00:35:06.250
since it's for a one-month
short-term rental,

00:35:06.250 --> 00:35:06.910
it's even harder

00:35:06.910 --> 00:35:08.570
to negotiate with this price.

00:35:08.960 --> 00:35:10.800
I'm aware of all the issues you mentioned,

00:35:10.800 --> 00:35:12.110
but I'd still appreciate

00:35:12.110 --> 00:35:13.760
if you could keep an eye out for me.

00:35:13.760 --> 00:35:14.840
Sure, sure.

00:35:18.960 --> 00:35:21.400
That Mr. Xiao who rented
your previous place,

00:35:21.400 --> 00:35:22.800
is he still living there?

00:35:23.190 --> 00:35:24.640
It's precisely because
he's still renting it

00:35:24.640 --> 00:35:26.500
that I need to find another place.

00:35:27.920 --> 00:35:30.030
This Mr. Xiao is also quite strange.

00:35:30.030 --> 00:35:31.240
I previously introduced him to

00:35:31.240 --> 00:35:32.710
that new complex nearby.

00:35:32.990 --> 00:35:34.440
It even has free parking spaces

00:35:34.440 --> 00:35:35.500
available for him.

00:35:35.680 --> 00:35:37.200
But he wasn't interested

00:35:37.220 --> 00:35:39.240
and insisted on living in some old lane.

00:35:39.240 --> 00:35:40.190
At first, he even said

00:35:40.190 --> 00:35:41.550
he must find something

00:35:42.020 --> 00:35:43.670
near Lane 7, Number 11.

00:35:44.470 --> 00:35:45.800
Lane 7, Number 11?

00:35:46.190 --> 00:35:47.590
Isn't that place vacant?

00:35:47.720 --> 00:35:48.470
He's not short of money,

00:35:48.470 --> 00:35:50.030
so why didn't he just rent
that place directly?

00:35:50.030 --> 00:35:51.960
That house isn't available for rent.

00:35:51.960 --> 00:35:54.560
The owner bought it for
the sake of collecting.

00:35:55.960 --> 00:35:58.240
I've heard of property investment,

00:35:58.630 --> 00:35:59.760
but for collection?

00:36:00.610 --> 00:36:02.530
That landlord is really wealthy.

00:36:03.150 --> 00:36:03.840
He even has

00:36:04.150 --> 00:36:06.080
his own Baidu encyclopedia entry.

00:36:13.240 --> 00:36:14.030
This Xie Lin

00:36:14.030 --> 00:36:15.960
used to live on Yanhua Road
when he was a child.

00:36:15.960 --> 00:36:16.470
Since childhood,

00:36:16.470 --> 00:36:17.440
he grew up in this lane

00:36:17.440 --> 00:36:18.880
with his grandfather.

00:36:19.110 --> 00:36:19.760
Unfortunately,

00:36:19.760 --> 00:36:21.280
when he was in his teens,

00:36:21.280 --> 00:36:22.730
his grandfather passed away.

00:36:22.730 --> 00:36:25.190
He had to go live with his parents
in Shenzhen,

00:36:25.190 --> 00:36:26.790
and later went abroad.

00:36:26.840 --> 00:36:27.550
This house

00:36:27.550 --> 00:36:29.370
changed hands many times.

00:36:29.550 --> 00:36:30.150
In the end,

00:36:30.150 --> 00:36:31.590
it was my mentor who made the connection

00:36:31.590 --> 00:36:33.320
and helped buy it back.

00:36:34.260 --> 00:36:35.340
That makes sense.

00:36:35.940 --> 00:36:38.160
No wonder he insisted on living
in this lane.

00:36:38.160 --> 00:36:39.930
It was for Xie Lin all along.

00:36:39.960 --> 00:36:40.920
So that means we have to wait until

00:36:40.920 --> 00:36:42.320
the design competition is over

00:36:42.320 --> 00:36:43.150
before moving out?

00:36:43.150 --> 00:36:43.610
Well...

00:36:44.360 --> 00:36:47.030
I'll just have to share the place
with him then.

00:36:48.010 --> 00:36:49.740
Share?

00:36:54.570 --> 00:36:55.340
Ms. Zhou?

00:36:55.890 --> 00:36:56.600
Hu Xiu,

00:36:56.630 --> 00:36:57.940
check the message I sent you.

00:36:57.940 --> 00:37:00.070
Send me a copy of all the materials
mentioned there.

00:37:00.070 --> 00:37:00.920
I'm sorry, Ms. Zhou.

00:37:00.920 --> 00:37:01.550
I wasn't

00:37:01.550 --> 00:37:03.350
looking at my messages just now.

00:37:04.570 --> 00:37:05.670
I'll send them to you.

00:37:05.670 --> 00:37:06.470
Just a moment.

00:37:07.400 --> 00:37:07.920
It's already late.

00:37:07.920 --> 00:37:09.470
I'm sorry for disturbing you.

00:37:09.470 --> 00:37:10.630
I had no choice either.

00:37:10.630 --> 00:37:13.080
I just received a notification from Lyman
earlier tonight that

00:37:13.080 --> 00:37:15.280
the submission deadline has suddenly been
moved up by two days.

00:37:15.280 --> 00:37:15.840
So I thought

00:37:15.840 --> 00:37:17.420
I should quickly confirm these materials.

00:37:17.420 --> 00:37:17.990
Tomorrow morning,

00:37:17.990 --> 00:37:19.030
I will work with the team to...

00:37:19.030 --> 00:37:20.510
Early submission?

00:37:38.830 --> 00:37:39.540
Mr. Xiao,

00:37:39.920 --> 00:37:42.070
what happened to your hand?

00:37:42.550 --> 00:37:44.280
You received the email, right?

00:37:44.490 --> 00:37:46.110
The submission deadline has been moved up.

00:37:46.110 --> 00:37:48.110
I'm worried about our progress now.

00:37:48.230 --> 00:37:49.800
Can you still draw with your hand?

00:37:49.800 --> 00:37:50.800
It's not serious.

00:37:51.070 --> 00:37:52.400
After a few more days of recovery,

00:37:52.400 --> 00:37:54.600
I'll speed up and get the drawings done.

00:37:55.190 --> 00:37:56.400
You should rest properly first.

00:37:56.400 --> 00:37:57.540
Don't force yourself to work.

00:37:57.540 --> 00:37:59.400
Your hand's recovery is very important.

00:37:59.400 --> 00:38:00.510
I'll see if I can

00:38:00.510 --> 00:38:01.760
transfer a designer from

00:38:01.760 --> 00:38:03.400
another project to assist you.

00:38:03.400 --> 00:38:04.070
Got it.

00:38:11.110 --> 00:38:11.760
Mr. Xiao.

00:38:14.030 --> 00:38:14.590
Come in.

00:38:19.320 --> 00:38:21.150
After hearing the revised proposal,

00:38:21.150 --> 00:38:23.030
I tried to draw
some revised designs myself.

00:38:23.030 --> 00:38:25.210
Would you mind taking a look?

00:38:36.440 --> 00:38:37.370
Mr. Xiao.

00:38:37.400 --> 00:38:39.000
I've been thinking all night

00:38:39.280 --> 00:38:41.830
about how I can
better fulfill my responsibilities.

00:38:41.830 --> 00:38:43.870
Since your hand is injured

00:38:43.890 --> 00:38:46.410
and these revisions are urgent,

00:38:46.720 --> 00:38:47.760
if you have any work

00:38:47.760 --> 00:38:49.450
that I can help with,

00:38:49.480 --> 00:38:51.340
please don't hesitate to tell me.

00:38:51.630 --> 00:38:52.400
How did you know

00:38:52.400 --> 00:38:54.440
the revisions are urgent?

00:38:55.470 --> 00:38:55.960
Well...

00:38:56.360 --> 00:38:59.240
time was already tight to begin with.

00:39:02.560 --> 00:39:03.640
So I think

00:39:04.190 --> 00:39:05.280
you should reconsider

00:39:05.280 --> 00:39:07.740
my suggestion about sharing the apartment.

00:39:09.570 --> 00:39:11.370
I can help you with the drawings.

00:39:11.530 --> 00:39:13.660
Working overtime is no problem at all.

00:39:14.400 --> 00:39:15.660
While you're injured,

00:39:15.880 --> 00:39:16.920
I'll take care of all the housework.

00:39:16.920 --> 00:39:17.670
In short,

00:39:17.670 --> 00:39:20.320
I can completely become
your new right hand.

00:39:25.310 --> 00:39:27.710
You really want to be roommates
that badly?

00:39:29.280 --> 00:39:32.470
The café cannot possibly be
as comfortable as home.

00:39:32.470 --> 00:39:33.190
And your work efficiency

00:39:33.190 --> 00:39:35.150
won't be as high as when you're at home.

00:39:35.150 --> 00:39:37.030
Whether from a personal perspective,

00:39:37.030 --> 00:39:38.550
or from a work perspective,

00:39:38.550 --> 00:39:40.550
or from your perspective, Mr. Xiao,

00:39:40.800 --> 00:39:43.110
sharing an apartment is a great choice.

00:39:49.440 --> 00:39:49.920
Fine.

00:39:50.250 --> 00:39:51.470
Move back as soon as possible.

00:39:51.470 --> 00:39:52.870
We have a lot of work to do.

00:39:56.670 --> 00:39:57.880
Just like that?

00:39:58.860 --> 00:39:59.740
What else?

00:40:10.280 --> 00:40:10.960
Coming.

00:40:17.230 --> 00:40:18.160
Why are you here?

00:40:18.670 --> 00:40:20.070
I heard you hurt your hand.

00:40:20.070 --> 00:40:21.270
I came to check on you.

00:40:21.360 --> 00:40:22.150
Are you okay?

00:40:22.840 --> 00:40:23.640
It's nothing.

00:40:24.720 --> 00:40:25.800
You...

00:40:25.800 --> 00:40:27.200
You're so tight-lipped.

00:40:27.390 --> 00:40:29.390
Not a single word about your injury.

00:40:29.960 --> 00:40:32.690
I couldn't hide it from you
even if I tried my best.

00:40:32.710 --> 00:40:34.360
Why are you hiding

00:40:34.360 --> 00:40:35.890
this heroic rescue from me?

00:40:36.110 --> 00:40:37.070
You're sweating so much,

00:40:37.070 --> 00:40:37.960
yet still talking non-stop.

00:40:37.960 --> 00:40:39.360
Drink this to rehydrate.

00:40:40.150 --> 00:40:40.720
Oh right,

00:40:40.720 --> 00:40:41.400
try this

00:40:41.400 --> 00:40:42.030
medicinal patch later.

00:40:42.030 --> 00:40:43.230
I heard it works well.

00:40:46.280 --> 00:40:46.880
By the way,

00:40:48.260 --> 00:40:49.590
if you don't have anything important,

00:40:49.590 --> 00:40:51.030
stop coming over so often.

00:40:51.030 --> 00:40:52.560
Just giving you a heads-up.

00:40:53.240 --> 00:40:53.960
Why?

00:40:54.800 --> 00:40:56.330
The landlord moved back in.

00:40:57.980 --> 00:40:59.190
So are you moving out?

00:40:59.240 --> 00:41:00.240
Your hand is still injured.

00:41:00.240 --> 00:41:01.320
How can you move now?

00:41:01.320 --> 00:41:02.190
I'm not moving.

00:41:02.720 --> 00:41:03.580
We're sharing.

00:41:08.220 --> 00:41:09.220
Sharing?

00:41:11.040 --> 00:41:11.880
I'm really

00:41:11.880 --> 00:41:14.440
seeing Hu Xiu in a new light.

00:41:15.400 --> 00:41:15.990
No wonder

00:41:15.990 --> 00:41:18.990
someone started buying
grapefruit-flavored water.

00:41:19.520 --> 00:41:22.250
It's pretty impressive that she managed
to convince you

00:41:22.250 --> 00:41:23.510
to share an apartment.

00:41:24.150 --> 00:41:25.190
Could she be

00:41:25.190 --> 00:41:27.280
coming back just to repay you?

00:41:28.590 --> 00:41:31.120
She actually put on quite a show in front of me.

00:41:35.510 --> 00:41:36.670
Has her friend's café

00:41:36.670 --> 00:41:38.070
had any problems lately?

00:41:39.670 --> 00:41:41.130
It's operating normally.

00:41:41.550 --> 00:41:42.280
However,

00:41:42.760 --> 00:41:44.030
that video of them disciplining someone

00:41:44.030 --> 00:41:45.240
during the murder mystery game

00:41:45.240 --> 00:41:46.680
has spread throughout the industrial park.

00:41:46.680 --> 00:41:48.280
It must have had some impact.

00:41:49.050 --> 00:41:50.260
Go check for me

00:41:50.280 --> 00:41:51.550
if anything else has happened.
