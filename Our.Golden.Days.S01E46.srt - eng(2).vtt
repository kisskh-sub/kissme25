00:00:01.234 --> 00:00:02.334
What is the medicine for?

00:00:04.264 --> 00:00:05.274
What?

00:00:06.734 --> 00:00:07.734
Heart failure?

00:00:09.044 --> 00:00:10.574
What exactly is heart failure?

00:00:11.004 --> 00:00:14.944
It's when your heart gets weaker and can't pump enough blood.

00:00:15.384 --> 00:00:16.984
Basically, their heart function is weakened.

00:00:18.884 --> 00:00:20.554
Is it really serious?

00:00:22.024 --> 00:00:25.094
It depends on their condition. You can't tell from the medication.

00:00:25.954 --> 00:00:28.054
If they're still working, it's probably not that severe.

00:00:31.734 --> 00:00:32.764
Really?

00:00:35.704 --> 00:00:37.704
(Younglim)

00:00:40.474 --> 00:00:42.504
So he was acting that way because he's sick.

00:00:43.044 --> 00:00:46.614
My mom packed enough tofu pockets for two.

00:00:46.814 --> 00:00:48.944
The thing is, I don't eat tofu pockets.

00:00:49.414 --> 00:00:50.414
I don't like them.

00:00:50.484 --> 00:00:52.514
Something's come up at work.

00:00:52.884 --> 00:00:55.224
We're not at the point where I share company secrets.

00:00:55.484 --> 00:00:56.684
I don't have the bandwidth to be considerate...

00:00:59.194 --> 00:01:00.554
or worry about anyone else.

00:01:01.924 --> 00:01:03.594
No wonder it felt off.

00:01:04.964 --> 00:01:07.794
When you're sick, your loved one should be there for you.

00:01:08.704 --> 00:01:12.274
Pushing me away, acting fine, while thinking he's protecting me.

00:01:15.104 --> 00:01:16.604
Lee Ji Hyuk, I swear...

00:01:26.514 --> 00:01:28.424
There's quite a lot to prepare.

00:01:30.854 --> 00:01:32.524
How about this, Mr. Han?

00:01:33.354 --> 00:01:36.464
I have a better idea.

00:01:40.494 --> 00:01:41.664
And what's that?

00:01:42.264 --> 00:01:43.864
A way to make him...

00:01:43.864 --> 00:01:46.474
release the collateral mortgage without a lawsuit.

00:01:47.974 --> 00:01:49.244
There's a way to do that?

00:01:49.944 --> 00:01:54.344
My husband is convinced I'd never actually sue him.

00:01:55.744 --> 00:01:59.054
Because I can't afford a retainer, and time isn't on my side.

00:02:00.554 --> 00:02:04.424
A lawsuit can take anywhere from 1 to 3 years, it's true.

00:02:04.754 --> 00:02:05.894
Exactly.

00:02:06.154 --> 00:02:07.724
But then, I go ahead and file the lawsuit.

00:02:08.824 --> 00:02:13.264
He knows if it goes to court, he could face criminal charges.

00:02:13.634 --> 00:02:14.734
You think he'd let it get to that point?

00:02:14.794 --> 00:02:17.404
But you said you were going to sue him.

00:02:18.434 --> 00:02:21.374
I was. But like I said, I've thought of a better way.

00:02:22.974 --> 00:02:27.674
I need you to draft the complaint and send him a photo of it.

00:02:28.044 --> 00:02:29.984
That'll get a reaction out of him.

00:02:32.354 --> 00:02:33.784
So he'll reach out to you...

00:02:34.154 --> 00:02:35.784
and propose a settlement.

00:02:37.654 --> 00:02:39.554
No, he'll contact you, Attorney Han.

00:02:40.354 --> 00:02:43.924
He'll probably offer you money not to take this case.

00:02:46.094 --> 00:02:47.564
Then let's use that money...

00:02:47.794 --> 00:02:50.264
for the retainer on my divorce case.

00:02:52.904 --> 00:02:55.104
You really think he'll do that?

00:02:57.144 --> 00:02:58.174
One hundred percent.

00:03:02.014 --> 00:03:03.244
As tempting as that is,

00:03:03.744 --> 00:03:05.284
that would be a violation of the Attorney Act for me.

00:03:06.314 --> 00:03:09.054
Really? Then don't take the money.

00:03:09.684 --> 00:03:13.454
Him contacting you will in itself be proof...

00:03:13.524 --> 00:03:14.724
that he secretly got the mortgage.

00:03:15.524 --> 00:03:18.634
Whether he texts or calls you using someone else's name,

00:03:19.264 --> 00:03:22.304
his goal will be to tell you not to represent Ko Seong Hui.

00:03:24.864 --> 00:03:28.674
- So? - Give me proof they contacted you.

00:03:29.274 --> 00:03:30.974
I'll handle the negotiations myself.

00:03:33.274 --> 00:03:36.714
So, all I have to do for now is draft the official complaint.

00:03:37.584 --> 00:03:39.354
You can do that right away, can't you?

00:03:39.854 --> 00:03:41.414
Just drafting the complaint? Yes, I can do that.

00:03:42.184 --> 00:03:44.054
In that case, should we draft...

00:03:44.054 --> 00:03:45.524
a 20 percent contingency fee contract?

00:03:45.854 --> 00:03:48.394
Even if we settle, a promise is a promise.

00:03:49.024 --> 00:03:50.224
Even if we settle?

00:03:51.194 --> 00:03:52.994
A 20 percent contingency fee.

00:03:53.434 --> 00:03:57.034
Once the mortgage is cleared, you'll start my divorce case.

00:03:58.464 --> 00:04:02.104
He's the at-fault party now, so I can get a divorce, right?

00:04:03.974 --> 00:04:05.204
If we can pull that off...

00:04:06.374 --> 00:04:07.714
But will it really work?

Shoe...

00:04:15.324 --> 00:04:19.454
The key is that a real lawyer has taken on the case.

00:04:20.624 --> 00:04:24.794
He must've thought since I'm broke, I'd never be able to hire a lawyer.

It's wonderful to have someone you can't live without.

00:11:27.054 --> 00:11:28.854
For Eun Oh's mom and her younger brother too.

00:11:29.624 --> 00:11:33.994
Dad found out and added more guards without her family knowing.

00:11:36.294 --> 00:11:38.224
And while all that was happening, I'm just lying here...

00:11:39.234 --> 00:11:40.434
I feel so bad for you.

00:11:42.734 --> 00:11:44.104
If you're worried about me,

00:11:46.504 --> 00:11:47.674
then you better make it through this.

00:11:49.944 --> 00:11:50.944
Without you,

00:11:53.444 --> 00:11:54.444
what would I do?

00:12:09.764 --> 00:12:11.724
So? Did you two actually do it?

00:12:11.864 --> 00:12:14.234
It's fine. I won't let him get away this time. I mean it.

00:12:14.464 --> 00:12:17.364
- Listen to that confidence. - I'm so embarrassed.

00:12:24.244 --> 00:12:26.814
Eun Oh still has such a beautiful smile.

00:12:58.844 --> 00:12:59.844
Hey, Ji Hyuk!

00:13:00.114 --> 00:13:02.844
- Dad! - What are the odds?

00:13:03.284 --> 00:13:04.444
Hey, here's your lunch.

00:13:06.214 --> 00:13:07.554
Wait, you packed me lunch?

00:13:07.554 --> 00:13:10.854
I'll be packing your lunch from now on.

00:13:11.724 --> 00:13:14.054
But Dad, I'm already signed up for a healthy meal delivery service.

00:13:14.124 --> 00:13:15.554
Just cancel it.

00:13:16.164 --> 00:13:19.064
Come on, let me do this one thing for you. Please?

00:13:19.494 --> 00:13:22.504
I'll make it for you after your mom leaves for work,

00:13:22.564 --> 00:13:24.334
and then I'll drop it off right here for you.

00:13:24.834 --> 00:13:26.174
Dad...

00:13:26.574 --> 00:13:30.774
Hey, you must be craving something. Just name it, and I'll make it.

00:13:31.004 --> 00:13:32.544
I can even make it with low sodium.

00:13:35.644 --> 00:13:38.984
Okay, then I'll only take them until you have to leave for work.

00:13:39.554 --> 00:13:41.114
Right. I have a job now, don't I?

00:13:43.054 --> 00:13:46.054
Hey, it's cold out. Get inside. Go on. I'm going. All right.

00:14:07.344 --> 00:14:10.744
Anyway, caffeine is bad for Ji Hyuk,

00:14:10.744 --> 00:14:12.884
so if anyone gives him coffee, you have to take it from him.

00:14:14.214 --> 00:14:18.624
I don't get why he's hiding it. If you're sick, just tell people.

00:14:20.354 --> 00:14:22.354
His parents must know, right?

00:14:24.494 --> 00:14:26.094
He's hiding it...

00:14:26.594 --> 00:14:29.204
because he really hates being a burden to anyone.

00:14:30.304 --> 00:14:31.304
Unbelievable.

00:14:32.674 --> 00:14:36.744
But surely he wouldn't hide it from his parents, right?

00:14:39.214 --> 00:14:40.214
Who could be calling?

00:14:46.054 --> 00:14:47.684
(Yong Su Cheol)

00:14:50.124 --> 00:14:54.124
- Hey, Su Cheol. - Mr. Earl...

00:14:56.264 --> 00:14:58.824
Hello? Are you there?

00:14:59.494 --> 00:15:02.034
Sorry about that.

00:15:03.004 --> 00:15:06.834
I was just wondering if I should still be calling you Mr. Early.

00:15:07.574 --> 00:15:09.704
What? What are you talking about?

00:15:12.944 --> 00:15:16.484
You see, I have feelings for Ji Hyuk.

00:15:17.884 --> 00:15:19.554
You...

00:15:20.384 --> 00:15:22.014
You like Ji Hyuk?

00:15:23.754 --> 00:15:24.754
Yes.

00:15:25.754 --> 00:15:26.824
That's why...

00:15:27.454 --> 00:15:31.294
it feels weird calling you Mr. Early like we're just friends.

00:15:32.734 --> 00:15:35.034
So I don't know if I should call you Mr. Lee,

00:15:35.434 --> 00:15:37.304
or if I should call you Father.

00:15:39.104 --> 00:15:40.104
Hello?

00:15:42.404 --> 00:15:43.404
Are you still there?

00:15:45.104 --> 00:15:46.114
Father?

00:15:48.744 --> 00:15:50.744
Goodness.

00:15:51.514 --> 00:15:54.014
I like the sound of Father.

00:15:54.584 --> 00:15:59.454
All of Ji Hyuk's friends call me Dad or Father anyway, so why not?

00:16:00.094 --> 00:16:01.724
It's just that, all this time,

00:16:02.254 --> 00:16:05.994
I enjoyed having a young friend. That's all.

00:16:11.864 --> 00:16:13.604
Lately, Ji Hyuk...

00:16:13.904 --> 00:16:16.444
has seemed a little under the weather.

00:16:18.174 --> 00:16:19.814
The one thing I need you to do for me now...

00:16:20.914 --> 00:16:23.684
is make sure Mom, Ji Wan, and Su Bin don't find out.

00:16:25.484 --> 00:16:27.454
I want to live as if nothing is wrong.

00:16:29.284 --> 00:16:32.584
Oh, that's...

00:16:32.924 --> 00:16:35.724
Ji Hyuk's just been so wrapped up in work lately,

00:16:36.164 --> 00:16:38.494
that I think he's just run down from exhaustion.

00:16:39.164 --> 00:16:42.194
So at work, could you, Su Cheol... I mean, you...

00:16:42.734 --> 00:16:45.534
Eun Oh, could you please look out for him for me?

00:16:47.434 --> 00:16:49.304
You'd be okay with me taking care of him?

00:16:49.874 --> 00:16:52.744
Of course! Why wouldn't it be okay?

00:16:53.244 --> 00:16:56.014
Ji Hyuk likes you too, you know.

00:16:57.284 --> 00:16:58.914
You even know about that?

00:16:59.314 --> 00:17:03.184
I'm not trying to pressure you. Really.

00:17:09.224 --> 00:17:11.994
That means you don't mind me either. Right, Father?

00:17:13.334 --> 00:17:14.394
Then that's all I need to hear.

00:17:17.234 --> 00:17:20.134
How are you after your surgery? Are you doing okay?

00:17:20.734 --> 00:17:23.204
I'm doing great. Don't you worry.

00:17:23.874 --> 00:17:26.114
They said I'm totally fine.

00:17:27.574 --> 00:17:28.644
Good.

00:17:29.214 --> 00:17:30.344
That's a relief, then.

00:17:31.044 --> 00:17:34.114
But still, make sure you take care of yourself, all right?

00:17:34.684 --> 00:17:37.324
Looks like I've got another call.

00:17:38.024 --> 00:17:40.754
- I have to go. We'll talk later. - Okay, Father.

00:17:49.504 --> 00:17:51.564
So his father doesn't know either?

00:17:56.204 --> 00:17:58.344
Ji Hyuk is really something else.

00:18:00.044 --> 00:18:02.344
He must be so lonely, dealing with this all by himself.

00:18:16.264 --> 00:18:18.394
No. I can't let him go like this.

00:18:18.624 --> 00:18:21.294
Ji Hyuk... I can't let him go like this.

00:18:21.694 --> 00:18:23.064
This can't be happening.

00:18:25.604 --> 00:18:27.504
He's finally made it through that dark tunnel...

00:18:28.134 --> 00:18:30.044
and just stepped into the light.

00:18:30.774 --> 00:18:32.074
And now he's supposed to just die?

00:18:33.274 --> 00:18:34.914
No, that can't be right.

00:18:35.714 --> 00:18:38.614
I can't let him go like that. He was so close.

00:18:39.584 --> 00:18:41.414
All he had left to do was be happy.

00:18:42.154 --> 00:18:44.354
How can I let a son like that go?

00:18:51.894 --> 00:18:54.934
- Dad! What are you doing? - What?

00:18:57.964 --> 00:18:59.874
Dad, look at you. You look so haggard.

00:19:01.234 --> 00:19:04.844
Dad, where'd you go after making my lunch?

00:19:05.274 --> 00:19:08.714
I was a little bored, so I went for a walk.

00:19:09.074 --> 00:19:10.544
So, how was it? Was it any good?

00:19:10.914 --> 00:19:15.254
Yes. I dipped it in soy sauce. It was amazing.

00:19:15.314 --> 00:19:19.054
Really? That's a relief. Why'd you come down?

00:19:19.454 --> 00:19:22.864
I figured you'd be bored, so I came down.

00:19:23.824 --> 00:19:25.964
Dad, here. You can watch videos on this.

00:19:26.964 --> 00:19:30.964
Movies, documentaries, miniseries... There's tons of stuff.

00:19:31.964 --> 00:19:36.474
- You're saying I can use this? - Yes. It was mine...

00:19:36.544 --> 00:19:40.274
before I upgraded for video editing, but it's still pretty nice.

00:19:41.514 --> 00:19:43.814
I already saved a bunch of fun stuff on here for you.

00:19:44.614 --> 00:19:45.744
Just what I needed.

00:19:48.984 --> 00:19:51.754
(Heart transplant conditions)

00:19:52.784 --> 00:19:54.954
(Heart transplant conditions: Who is eligible?)

00:20:02.334 --> 00:20:05.464

(Traffic accident donations and heart transplant policy)

00:20:28.224 --> 00:20:29.394
There's no way.

00:20:30.964 --> 00:20:31.994
There's no way!

00:20:33.034 --> 00:20:36.564
Why? Why isn't there a way? Why?

00:20:44.474 --> 00:20:45.874
Why did it have to be Ji Hyuk?

00:20:46.744 --> 00:20:48.314
Of all people, why did it have to be Ji Hyuk?

00:20:49.444 --> 00:20:51.784
I'm right here. Take me instead.

00:20:52.544 --> 00:20:54.054
How can this be happening?

00:20:55.014 --> 00:20:56.084
How?

00:20:56.784 --> 00:20:57.884
How?

00:21:05.624 --> 00:21:06.634
Father!

00:21:07.934 --> 00:21:10.234
Why are you taking Ji Hyuk?

00:21:11.334 --> 00:21:12.334
Mom!

00:21:13.374 --> 00:21:15.004
Can't you do anything to stop this?

00:21:16.974 --> 00:21:18.004
How do I get there?

00:21:18.444 --> 00:21:22.274
How do I get there? I'll go talk to them myself. I will!

00:21:30.854 --> 00:21:31.854
Ji Hyuk.

00:21:32.284 --> 00:21:34.194
What am I going to do about Ji Hyuk? My boy, Ji Hyuk.

00:21:34.794 --> 00:21:37.164
Please, just save him.

00:21:37.924 --> 00:21:39.894
Please save him.

00:21:41.564 --> 00:21:43.064
If you just save Ji Hyuk,

00:21:44.034 --> 00:21:47.174
you can take my life right now.

00:21:48.434 --> 00:21:52.904
Please, just save him. I'm begging you.

00:22:00.514 --> 00:22:02.384
Yeong Ra, this...

00:22:06.424 --> 00:22:07.454
Writer Park.

00:22:08.654 --> 00:22:09.664
Yes?

00:22:10.494 --> 00:22:12.064
So you do know you're a writer.

00:22:12.694 --> 00:22:13.894
What's with the long face?

00:22:14.264 --> 00:22:15.834
Are you still worried about your mother?

00:22:18.634 --> 00:22:22.574
She was blowing up my phone, and then suddenly, nothing.

00:22:24.174 --> 00:22:27.674
I'm unsure if she found another way, or if something's happened to her.

00:22:28.944 --> 00:22:30.014
It's making me so anxious.

00:22:31.814 --> 00:22:34.954
I get it. She's still your mother, after all.

00:22:36.084 --> 00:22:37.084
Right.

00:22:38.184 --> 00:22:39.184
Hey, Yeong Ra.

00:22:40.554 --> 00:22:42.694
Let me tell you a really interesting story.

00:22:45.724 --> 00:22:48.494
The tragic love life of Lee Ji Wan?

00:22:49.864 --> 00:22:51.064
Your love life?

00:22:51.664 --> 00:22:54.634
I was a pretty simple guy when it came to dating.

00:22:55.134 --> 00:22:59.544
When I liked someone, I'd go all in, showering them with flowers,

00:22:59.644 --> 00:23:01.674
and when she wanted a nice car, I leased a luxury import.

00:23:02.674 --> 00:23:07.184
But she wouldn't marry me unless I got a three-bedroom unit in Seoul.

00:23:07.654 --> 00:23:08.684
Like that's even possible.

00:23:09.584 --> 00:23:11.184
Wait, you were going to get married?

00:23:11.984 --> 00:23:14.024
I really liked her back then.

00:23:15.354 --> 00:23:17.894
But then, out of nowhere, she hands me a wedding invitation.

00:23:18.164 --> 00:23:20.834
She was getting married to some other guy in a week.

00:23:22.034 --> 00:23:23.104
You've got to be kidding me.

00:23:23.704 --> 00:23:26.534
Wait, so she was cheating on you the whole time?

00:23:27.304 --> 00:23:28.834
- Yes. - That witch!

00:23:29.674 --> 00:23:32.704
Did you just call her a witch?

00:23:33.274 --> 00:23:34.944
She is one!

00:23:35.374 --> 00:23:36.814
I can't believe people like that exist.

00:23:37.514 --> 00:23:40.254
So what did you do? Did you get revenge?

00:23:40.614 --> 00:23:45.254
Revenge? Please. She married a rich guy with a fancy apartment.

00:23:45.724 --> 00:23:46.824
I couldn't do a thing.

00:23:47.324 --> 00:23:48.624
It's not like I have that kind of power.

00:23:49.824 --> 00:23:51.264
What's wrong with you?

00:23:51.624 --> 00:23:55.334
You should've at least exposed her. Told him she was a two-timer.

00:23:57.004 --> 00:23:59.564
She must've had zero respect for you to give you an invitation.

00:24:00.004 --> 00:24:02.574
She knew you wouldn't dare make a scene at her wedding!

00:24:03.374 --> 00:24:06.174
She knew. Hong Mi knew me too well.

00:24:06.644 --> 00:24:10.714
But with me, you're always so tough and blowing me off.

00:24:11.014 --> 00:24:12.514
You even took down that stalker.

00:24:13.554 --> 00:24:16.354
I'm just a softie when it comes to my girl.

00:24:16.754 --> 00:24:17.854
And I never cheat.

00:24:19.954 --> 00:24:21.024
"Your girl?"

00:24:22.124 --> 00:24:26.634
So you're so hard on me because I'm not your girlfriend.

00:24:28.234 --> 00:24:29.564
Pathetic, isn't it?

00:24:30.234 --> 00:24:33.574
Hey, I wonder if we could use this as an episode for "City Rapunzel."

00:24:35.074 --> 00:24:36.074
Let's do it.

00:24:36.744 --> 00:24:39.404
And let's make it a huge hit so that she's forced to watch it.

00:24:40.814 --> 00:24:42.544
That woman is so infuriating!

00:24:43.074 --> 00:24:44.314
You're frustrating, too.

00:24:47.854 --> 00:24:51.224
I'll have to think about how to frame this revenge episode.

00:24:53.724 --> 00:24:55.354
Bring me the files. Let's brainstorm.

00:24:55.924 --> 00:24:57.024
What? Okay.

00:25:02.294 --> 00:25:04.034
I guess her mom's no longer on her mind now.

00:25:04.904 --> 00:25:05.904
What a relief.

00:25:11.344 --> 00:25:13.214
Why haven't I heard from Park Jin Seok?

00:25:14.614 --> 00:25:16.614
This shouldn't be taking so long.

00:25:22.354 --> 00:25:24.654
Attorney Han, still no word?

00:25:29.454 --> 00:25:30.794
The nerve.

00:25:35.834 --> 00:25:40.434
I'm sorry. For personal reasons, I must withdraw from this case.

00:25:40.904 --> 00:25:41.904
You're backing out?

00:25:42.904 --> 00:25:44.404
Is he out of his mind?

00:25:48.774 --> 00:25:50.744
(Attorney Han Seong Ju)

00:25:50.814 --> 00:25:52.814
Park Jin Seok paid you off, didn't he?

00:25:53.754 --> 00:25:57.454
He paid you to drop my case. How much was it?

00:25:57.484 --> 00:26:01.624
That's an insulting accusation. It's a serious ethical violation.

00:26:01.994 --> 00:26:04.894
- Then why are you dropping my case? - It's just that...

00:26:06.194 --> 00:26:08.134
There are circumstances I'm not at liberty to discuss.

00:26:09.394 --> 00:26:10.464
How much did he pay you?

00:26:11.264 --> 00:26:12.264
Did he offer more...

00:26:12.264 --> 00:26:13.274
than my eight-million-dollar contingency fee?

00:26:13.904 --> 00:26:15.174
That can't be it.

00:26:15.174 --> 00:26:17.344
Even as chairman, do you think he'd spend eight million...

00:26:17.344 --> 00:26:19.474
just to teach his wife a lesson?

00:26:22.544 --> 00:26:23.814
Did he threaten to make sure you lose?

00:26:24.214 --> 00:26:26.544
Or is it because you think you can't get the contingency fee?

00:26:29.154 --> 00:26:30.484
It's because I'm afraid.

00:26:30.724 --> 00:26:33.184
Ma'am, you're up against someone who can corner a person like this,

00:26:33.254 --> 00:26:35.754
and I'm afraid I'll get caught up and just vanish without a trace.

00:26:38.464 --> 00:26:40.734
So he threatened you and paid you off at the same time.

00:26:41.064 --> 00:26:42.334
I wasn't threatened.

00:26:44.004 --> 00:26:45.134
And I received no money.

00:26:45.404 --> 00:26:46.404
Shut it!

00:26:47.304 --> 00:26:49.974
How dare you tell such a blatant lie to my face.

00:26:50.944 --> 00:26:51.944
Please leave.

00:26:53.644 --> 00:26:56.044
Fine. Just tell me what he said to you.

00:26:56.784 --> 00:26:58.644
He did contact you, right?

00:26:58.684 --> 00:27:02.184
He did, but I can't tell you what was said.

00:27:09.324 --> 00:27:10.894
Is that so? All right.

00:27:10.964 --> 00:27:12.724
(Chairman Park Jin Seok)

00:27:17.764 --> 00:27:19.734
I wonder what you'll pull next.

00:27:21.334 --> 00:27:22.374
Ko Seong Hui.

00:27:22.874 --> 00:27:24.774
You're clearly backed into a corner now.

00:27:30.644 --> 00:27:31.684
I'm home.

00:27:32.484 --> 00:27:33.614
Ji Hyuk.

00:27:34.314 --> 00:27:35.314
Have you eaten?

00:27:35.754 --> 00:27:37.184
I ate already, Mom.

00:27:38.054 --> 00:27:40.154
From now on, don't worry about making me dinner.

00:27:40.754 --> 00:27:42.094
I won't be able to eat dinner at home.

00:27:42.724 --> 00:27:43.724
Are you busy again?

00:27:45.364 --> 00:27:47.564
Yes. Where's Dad?

00:27:48.034 --> 00:27:50.234
Your dad has been going out a lot lately.

00:27:50.564 --> 00:27:52.164
Can you believe he just sent a text today, too?

00:27:54.074 --> 00:27:55.804
You should go out with friends too, Mom.

00:27:56.434 --> 00:27:59.644
You get off work early. Go out and have a nice dinner,

00:27:59.704 --> 00:28:00.774
and maybe go to a dessert cafe.

00:28:01.774 --> 00:28:03.214
That sounds wonderful.

00:28:05.684 --> 00:28:09.614
And, Mom. Check your bank account tomorrow.

00:28:09.914 --> 00:28:11.624
I'll send you some money to spend.

00:28:16.724 --> 00:28:17.724
Oh my.

00:28:18.394 --> 00:28:21.234
My goodness, why does he have to sound so cool?

00:28:22.134 --> 00:28:24.104
"Mom, check your bank account tomorrow."

00:28:27.834 --> 00:28:29.404
My son's such a tough guy.

00:28:33.474 --> 00:28:34.644
Mom.

00:28:35.944 --> 00:28:37.714
Is that something to be so happy about?

00:28:42.014 --> 00:28:43.484
(Mr. Yeong Bo)

00:28:44.024 --> 00:28:45.454
Hey, sir.

00:28:47.694 --> 00:28:48.694
Ji Hyuk.

00:29:00.234 --> 00:29:01.234
Dad.

00:29:05.974 --> 00:29:08.914
Can you help me get him on my back?

00:29:11.344 --> 00:29:12.344
Dad.

00:29:15.584 --> 00:29:18.624
- Ji Hyuk, what's wrong with him? - Ji Hyuk! Put him down, quick!

00:29:18.624 --> 00:29:20.524
- Dad! - For goodness' sake!

00:29:21.294 --> 00:29:22.854
- Dad, are you okay? - Honey!

00:29:22.894 --> 00:29:25.024
Water... I need some water.

00:29:25.664 --> 00:29:26.664
Sure.

00:29:28.664 --> 00:29:31.204
- Honey! - Dad.

00:29:32.064 --> 00:29:34.634
- Ji Hyuk, can you carry... - Mom, we should do it.

00:29:34.634 --> 00:29:35.634
What?

00:29:36.634 --> 00:29:37.674
- Oh, honey. - Dad.

00:29:37.674 --> 00:29:40.644
You reek of alcohol. Try to sober up, will you?

00:29:57.924 --> 00:29:59.024
Here, Ji Hyuk.

00:29:59.324 --> 00:30:00.464
Thanks.

00:30:02.594 --> 00:30:04.004
Take your time.

00:30:13.374 --> 00:30:16.114
I haven't been working out lately,

00:30:16.884 --> 00:30:18.814
so I guess I'm not as strong as I used to be.

00:30:22.084 --> 00:30:25.124
What are you talking about? Do you know how much Dad weighs?

00:30:25.654 --> 00:30:27.124
You must have been exhausted.

00:30:28.124 --> 00:30:29.294
Get some rest.

00:30:38.204 --> 00:30:39.564
My poor brother.

00:30:47.374 --> 00:30:48.914
You reek of alcohol.

00:30:49.374 --> 00:30:51.544
Why is he acting so out of character?

00:30:52.584 --> 00:30:55.284
Now that he's finally employed, his worries should be over.

00:31:09.094 --> 00:31:10.094
Honey.

00:31:10.664 --> 00:31:12.364
How did I get home last night?

00:31:13.334 --> 00:31:15.734
Ji Hyuk had to carry you home on his back.

00:31:16.504 --> 00:31:19.944
What? Ji Hyuk carried me?

00:31:20.174 --> 00:31:22.344
Apparently, Yeong Bo called him.

00:31:27.454 --> 00:31:28.654
Are you going to the bathroom?

00:31:31.484 --> 00:31:32.954
Ji Hyuk already left for work.

00:31:40.934 --> 00:31:42.194
You crazy idiot...

00:31:42.864 --> 00:31:45.664
You idiot. You stupid jerk.

00:31:48.534 --> 00:31:50.274
Your son has a bad heart,

00:31:50.344 --> 00:31:53.944
and you had him carry this heavy body of yours?

00:31:54.014 --> 00:31:56.244
And you call yourself his father, you piece of trash?

00:32:01.454 --> 00:32:03.454
That poor kid must've been exhausted.

00:32:04.054 --> 00:32:06.524
He must've been so out of breath.

00:32:11.594 --> 00:32:13.894
Your dad is so sorry, you hear me?

00:32:25.104 --> 00:32:28.044
Dad, I made it to work fine and I'm doing okay.

00:32:28.844 --> 00:32:30.074
Don't worry about me.

00:32:31.614 --> 00:32:32.914
Are you really okay?

00:32:34.354 --> 00:32:36.484
I'm so, so sorry, Ji Hyuk.

00:32:43.524 --> 00:32:44.924
Want me to send you a photo?

00:32:46.164 --> 00:32:47.894
It's starting to feel like I'm dating you, Dad.

00:32:47.934 --> 00:32:52.704
(My eldest son)

00:32:54.474 --> 00:32:56.504
Thank you, my lord.

00:32:57.244 --> 00:33:01.474
Now I get why you wanted to keep it a secret, Ji Hyuk.

00:33:01.774 --> 00:33:03.014
I get it now.

00:33:03.684 --> 00:33:04.714
Right.

00:33:05.714 --> 00:33:08.284
From now on, I promise not to let on. I won't.

00:33:18.964 --> 00:33:20.164
Thanks.

00:33:23.864 --> 00:33:26.234
I guess he'll be more careful now.

00:33:36.944 --> 00:33:38.984
(AP Group)

00:33:49.694 --> 00:33:50.994
I just dropped it off.

00:34:06.474 --> 00:34:10.914
I'll quietly leave it by the main entrance around 11:30am,

00:34:11.214 --> 00:34:12.544
so pick it up then.

00:34:12.844 --> 00:34:14.954
My dad is such a stickler for time.

00:34:25.024 --> 00:34:28.664
We're going for shabu-shabu. Want to come?

00:34:28.934 --> 00:34:32.834
Or maybe some poke? Is that too cold? How about sushi?

00:34:34.034 --> 00:34:36.074
If you want takeout, just give me your card.

00:34:38.374 --> 00:34:41.244
My dad... He packed a lunch for me.

00:34:43.514 --> 00:34:44.884
Really?

00:34:45.444 --> 00:34:46.444
Got it.

00:34:55.654 --> 00:34:58.424
I tell her my dad packed me a lunch,

00:34:59.824 --> 00:35:01.134
and she acts like it's totally normal.

00:35:15.074 --> 00:35:16.074
(Lee Ji Hyuk's Medication)

00:35:32.864 --> 00:35:34.594
Here, drink this.

00:35:38.234 --> 00:35:40.474
Ji Hyuk only drinks iced coffee. What's with the herbal tea?

00:35:43.734 --> 00:35:45.274
Not anymore, Su Jeong.

00:35:45.874 --> 00:35:48.274
I've been having trouble sleeping, so I quit coffee.

00:35:49.774 --> 00:35:53.284
Good call. That's why I switched to herbal tea, too.

00:35:54.214 --> 00:35:56.184
Thanks. I'll enjoy it.

00:36:04.294 --> 00:36:05.294
Sorry.

00:36:07.434 --> 00:36:09.564
- You just couldn't help yourself. - I'm sorry.

00:36:10.134 --> 00:36:11.804
- Unbelievable... - Just hit me.

00:36:24.584 --> 00:36:26.614
Eun Oh and Su Jeong. What was that all about?

00:36:27.454 --> 00:36:30.254
All of a sudden, Eun Oh tells me to drink herbal tea.

00:36:32.254 --> 00:36:36.124
Or maybe some poke? Is that too cold? How about sushi?

00:36:38.424 --> 00:36:41.334
Sushi is cold too, but it's something I can eat.

00:36:43.634 --> 00:36:46.404
My dad... He packed a lunch for me.

00:36:48.874 --> 00:36:50.234
Really?

00:36:50.804 --> 00:36:51.804
Got it.

00:36:52.174 --> 00:36:54.744
She acted as if she knew why he packed me a lunch.

00:36:55.614 --> 00:36:59.414
Want me to grab you a sandwich? How about a chicken breast sandwich?

00:37:01.384 --> 00:37:05.584
She's making sure I eat, she knows my diet,

00:37:06.184 --> 00:37:07.924
she's a friend of Dad's...

00:37:08.994 --> 00:37:10.394
Could Dad have told her?

00:37:11.364 --> 00:37:12.364
Come on.

00:37:12.794 --> 00:37:13.894
No way.

00:37:19.504 --> 00:37:20.504
Come in.

00:37:28.844 --> 00:37:31.044
What brings you to my office?

00:37:33.284 --> 00:37:34.284
Ji Eun Oh.

00:37:35.654 --> 00:37:37.824
You've moved on, right?

00:37:38.424 --> 00:37:39.554
Emotionally, I mean.

00:37:41.454 --> 00:37:42.454
Excuse me?

00:37:42.954 --> 00:37:44.394
What you told me the other day.

00:37:45.324 --> 00:37:49.234
And what if I mean it when I say I like you again?

00:37:50.534 --> 00:37:53.804
You're completely over those feelings, right?

00:37:54.904 --> 00:37:56.574
We're just alumni...

00:37:57.104 --> 00:37:58.344
and coworkers.

00:37:59.544 --> 00:38:01.074
That's all there is...

00:38:01.844 --> 00:38:02.974
to our relationship, right?

00:38:07.554 --> 00:38:08.584
Why are you...

00:38:08.954 --> 00:38:11.084
suddenly asking me to confirm that?

00:38:12.824 --> 00:38:14.054
I want to be sure,

00:38:15.454 --> 00:38:16.594
because...

00:38:16.994 --> 00:38:19.164
you're treating me very comfortably, like a junior would.

00:38:19.764 --> 00:38:23.334
You're looking out for my meals and getting me drinks.

00:38:23.764 --> 00:38:26.164
What do I do? What do I say?

00:38:27.734 --> 00:38:29.074
I want to make things clear.

00:38:29.734 --> 00:38:31.874
That's how I'll know whether to keep it strictly professional,

00:38:32.644 --> 00:38:35.714
or if we can be comfortable colleagues.

00:38:36.844 --> 00:38:37.844
You're over...

00:38:38.914 --> 00:38:39.984
your feelings for me, right?

00:38:51.194 --> 00:38:52.194
No.

00:38:56.464 --> 00:38:57.464
Then...

00:38:58.134 --> 00:39:00.734
what was all that behaviour about?

00:39:02.074 --> 00:39:03.134
Were you just pretending to care?

00:39:05.174 --> 00:39:06.174
I...

00:39:07.914 --> 00:39:09.014
I know that...

00:39:10.174 --> 00:39:11.184
you're sick.

00:39:13.584 --> 00:39:16.284
I figured it out from the medication you're taking.

00:39:21.624 --> 00:39:23.994
You're telling me you went through my desk?

00:39:25.494 --> 00:39:26.494
I did.

00:39:27.464 --> 00:39:29.764
Yes, I did. So what?

00:39:31.104 --> 00:39:32.434
You did the same thing.

00:39:33.064 --> 00:39:34.704
You said you couldn't give up on me...

00:39:34.704 --> 00:39:36.334
and that you'd do whatever you could.

00:39:37.774 --> 00:39:39.804
So what if I'm doing the same thing?

00:39:42.074 --> 00:39:46.714
Can we please get on the same page?

00:39:48.814 --> 00:39:50.514
Why is having heart failure such a big deal?

00:39:51.924 --> 00:39:54.024
You can get treatment while we're dating.

00:39:57.724 --> 00:39:58.824
Heart failure?

00:40:01.594 --> 00:40:02.594
I sent my friend...

00:40:03.994 --> 00:40:06.104
a list of the medications you're taking.

00:40:06.864 --> 00:40:08.334
She said it's for heart failure.

00:40:09.134 --> 00:40:10.944
I've even researched it and everything.

00:40:11.904 --> 00:40:14.344
So that's why. She thinks it's just heart failure.

00:40:17.174 --> 00:40:19.684
Do you really think that little of me?

00:40:20.854 --> 00:40:21.884
If the roles were reversed,

00:40:22.254 --> 00:40:25.824
and I was sick, would you leave me? Of course you wouldn't.

00:40:27.324 --> 00:40:30.624
I'm so sick of these games.

00:40:32.564 --> 00:40:33.824
This isn't a game.

00:40:35.534 --> 00:40:36.534
Then...

00:40:37.164 --> 00:40:38.164
go out with me.

00:40:40.534 --> 00:40:42.474
How can you be so confident when you have no idea?

00:40:43.104 --> 00:40:44.204
You've been sick before, too.

00:40:44.944 --> 00:40:45.944
Don't you understand how I feel?

00:40:47.174 --> 00:40:50.984
- I really don't care you're sick. - I'm sick, so I don't want to date!

00:40:54.044 --> 00:40:55.454
I don't have the energy for that.

00:40:57.524 --> 00:40:58.554
I don't want to.

00:40:59.724 --> 00:41:01.094
All those feelings...

00:41:04.124 --> 00:41:05.124
are just a hassle.

00:41:07.634 --> 00:41:08.694
Dealing with my illness and work...

00:41:11.264 --> 00:41:13.304
is all I can handle.

00:41:18.374 --> 00:41:19.374
That doesn't include you.

00:41:27.814 --> 00:41:28.814
That's a lie.

00:41:31.584 --> 00:41:34.294
Do you know how good you are at saying things you don't mean?

00:41:35.524 --> 00:41:37.564
Is that why you're thinking about taking on some copycat project?

00:41:38.294 --> 00:41:40.164
You deliberately provoked me so I'd take on...

00:41:40.764 --> 00:41:42.134
the head of the Turnkey Team position.

00:41:42.394 --> 00:41:44.734
I thought you didn't like talking to me, Ms. Ji Eun Oh.

00:41:45.134 --> 00:41:47.004
You were afraid I'd find out you liked me,

00:41:47.334 --> 00:41:48.874
so you pushed me away on purpose.

00:41:49.074 --> 00:41:51.574
You shouldn't have even remembered that I like the hanok style.

00:41:52.004 --> 00:41:54.244
Why do things I haven't asked for? It messes with my head.

00:41:55.344 --> 00:41:56.674
When you do this, it makes me...

00:41:57.244 --> 00:41:58.644
Instead of admitting you like me,

00:41:59.814 --> 00:42:01.214
you just get mad at me.

00:42:04.014 --> 00:42:07.554
You're hiding your illness and pushing me away, all for my sake.

00:42:08.554 --> 00:42:09.554
I...

00:42:10.094 --> 00:42:11.194
I'm not falling for it this time.

00:42:14.494 --> 00:42:15.594
You've got to be kidding me.

00:42:17.264 --> 00:42:18.564
Think whatever you want,

00:42:19.434 --> 00:42:20.534
but I'm the one saying no.

00:42:21.004 --> 00:42:23.704
Are you going to keep stressing out a sick person?

00:42:24.944 --> 00:42:26.374
Is that your way of showing you care?

00:42:29.614 --> 00:42:31.084
From now on, you...

00:42:33.144 --> 00:42:34.184
I mean, Ms. Ji.

00:42:37.184 --> 00:42:38.424
You're just my employee.

00:42:40.054 --> 00:42:41.554
Nothing more, nothing less.

00:42:44.224 --> 00:42:45.224
Keep that in mind.

00:42:45.764 --> 00:42:46.764
I refuse!

00:42:46.824 --> 00:42:48.864
(Younglim)

00:43:03.544 --> 00:43:05.514
(Thursday, January 22)

00:43:20.064 --> 00:43:21.134
I need a moment of your time.

00:43:21.264 --> 00:43:22.894
Message me on the company chat if it's about work.

00:43:33.504 --> 00:43:36.814
How can I help you? You need to go through me first.

00:43:37.574 --> 00:43:38.684
It's personal.

00:43:39.444 --> 00:43:40.684
Then I can't allow it.

00:43:41.584 --> 00:43:44.784
Team Leader Ji Eun Oh, this is a workplace.

00:43:47.724 --> 00:43:50.794
(CEO's Office)

00:44:14.214 --> 00:44:15.254
(Lee Ji Hyuk, CEO)

00:44:15.314 --> 00:44:16.314
(In a meeting. Please try again later.)

00:44:24.594 --> 00:44:25.924
(In a meeting. Please try again later.)

00:44:25.994 --> 00:44:27.564
I guess he's really not going to see me.

00:44:28.494 --> 00:44:29.864
He's being so cold-hearted.

00:44:30.734 --> 00:44:31.734
He's not giving me an opening.

00:44:33.864 --> 00:44:35.434
But...

00:44:36.034 --> 00:44:39.044
What if that's how Ji Hyuk really feels?

00:44:39.804 --> 00:44:42.044
He's got a huge responsibility running the company, and...

00:44:42.744 --> 00:44:45.484
we also don't know exactly what his condition is.

00:44:48.754 --> 00:44:49.854
That's true.

00:44:51.884 --> 00:44:53.524
But it's not like he's dying.

00:44:54.154 --> 00:44:55.924
We can get through it together.

00:44:56.554 --> 00:44:57.554
Right.

00:44:58.294 --> 00:44:59.294
Or am I wrong?

00:44:59.824 --> 00:45:01.294
By acting this way,

00:45:01.564 --> 00:45:03.894
am I just making things harder for Ji Hyuk?

00:45:05.964 --> 00:45:08.774
He's not giving you an inch.

00:45:12.744 --> 00:45:14.544
So I should just pretend I don't know anything and wait,

00:45:15.344 --> 00:45:18.884
and then pop up as his girlfriend after he's all better?

00:45:19.244 --> 00:45:20.544
That's ridiculous too.

00:45:23.714 --> 00:45:26.284
Just watching the man I love be sick like this...

00:45:27.794 --> 00:45:28.794
is so painful.

00:45:33.624 --> 00:45:35.834
What the heck? Are you crazy? Get out now!

00:45:35.894 --> 00:45:38.534
Eun Oh, this is urgent. We need to talk.

00:45:39.004 --> 00:45:41.174
The worst has happened because of you.

00:45:42.034 --> 00:45:43.604
So you and I have some talking to do.

00:45:46.044 --> 00:45:48.674
Su Jeong, I'm fine. You can leave us.

00:45:50.914 --> 00:45:51.914
Darn.

00:45:55.984 --> 00:45:59.484
If you feel even a bit unsafe, just scream. I'll be right outside.

00:46:01.154 --> 00:46:02.554
Why you little...

00:46:08.894 --> 00:46:10.564
You're really something else.

00:46:11.264 --> 00:46:12.364
How could you even think of seeing me again?

00:46:12.434 --> 00:46:15.074
You got me kicked out, so of course I had to come find you.

00:46:17.404 --> 00:46:18.504
You got kicked out?

00:46:18.504 --> 00:46:20.604
Did you think Seong Jae wouldn't tell his father?

00:46:21.844 --> 00:46:23.574
No, he wouldn't have.

00:46:24.144 --> 00:46:26.614
Mr. Park is a man of his word.

00:46:27.484 --> 00:46:29.514
Then how else would my husband have found out?

00:46:30.414 --> 00:46:33.324
He knew about you, Woo Jin, and that you were declared dead.

00:46:33.724 --> 00:46:35.154
How else would he know if it wasn't Seong Jae?

00:46:37.424 --> 00:46:40.394
So you came here to blame this on me?

00:46:41.594 --> 00:46:43.234
Thanks to you, I was kicked out without a penny to my name.

00:46:44.134 --> 00:46:45.664
Give me 200,000 dollars from the money I gave you.

00:46:46.404 --> 00:46:47.634
There's a lawsuit I have to deal with.

00:46:50.404 --> 00:46:52.344
You're here to get money from me?

00:46:53.074 --> 00:46:55.514
It's your fault, so you should pay me at least that.

00:46:56.344 --> 00:46:57.644
I'm down to my last 100 dollars.

00:46:59.744 --> 00:47:01.254
Should I give her the 200,000 dollars?

00:47:02.154 --> 00:47:03.154
Give me the 200,000 dollars,

00:47:03.684 --> 00:47:04.684
and I'll stay away from Woo Jin.

00:47:06.254 --> 00:47:07.254
What did you say?

00:47:07.554 --> 00:47:09.554
I said I'd give up Woo Jin for good.

00:47:10.124 --> 00:47:11.194
So give me the 200,000 dollars.

00:47:12.124 --> 00:47:13.124
No.

00:47:13.924 --> 00:47:16.634
What? After I ended up in this mess because of you,

00:47:16.694 --> 00:47:19.304
you won't give me 200,000 dollars out of the million?

00:47:19.964 --> 00:47:24.804
I wouldn't give a penny to someone who'd sell their son for 200,000.

00:47:25.204 --> 00:47:29.074
Besides, I don't have the money. I told you I gave it to Woo Jin.

00:47:29.244 --> 00:47:31.414
Then you can just ask Woo Jin for it.

00:47:33.384 --> 00:47:34.384
Hey, Su Jeong.

00:47:35.614 --> 00:47:36.754
What are you doing out here?

00:47:37.014 --> 00:47:38.124
Ji Hyuk, it's just...

00:47:38.724 --> 00:47:39.724
Fine. 100,000 dollars, then.

00:47:40.584 --> 00:47:42.594
If you don't even give me that, I won't just let this go.

00:47:42.854 --> 00:47:46.564
- Is that a threat? - Hey, Ji Eun Oh!

00:47:48.094 --> 00:47:49.964
I thought I told you to never set foot in here again.

00:47:50.864 --> 00:47:52.404
- Ji Hyuk. - What? What are you doing?

00:47:52.904 --> 00:47:53.904
Oh my.

00:47:55.434 --> 00:47:58.344
What the heck are you doing? Let go of me! Darn it.

00:47:58.344 --> 00:47:59.444
Are you even human?

00:48:00.004 --> 00:48:01.474
How dare you show your face here again?

00:48:01.814 --> 00:48:03.714
Who do you think you are, harassing Eun Oh?

00:48:03.974 --> 00:48:05.014
Do you have a death wish?

00:48:05.744 --> 00:48:07.714
That's why I said we should settle it with money,

00:48:07.714 --> 00:48:09.054
so we never see each other again.

00:48:09.684 --> 00:48:10.684
His heart.

00:48:11.114 --> 00:48:13.054
- Ji Hyuk, stop it. - Let go of me.

00:48:13.054 --> 00:48:15.954
Ji Hyuk, you should take it easy. Don't waste your strength on her.

00:48:16.054 --> 00:48:17.424
Ji Eun Oh, call the police.

00:48:17.554 --> 00:48:21.434
Wait, what? What did I do? I wanted to talk to my daughter.

00:48:21.534 --> 00:48:22.764
Who are you calling your daughter?

00:48:23.464 --> 00:48:25.264
Ji Eun Oh, call the police!

00:48:25.304 --> 00:48:26.464
- Ji Hyuk. - Let go of me!

00:48:27.034 --> 00:48:28.804
- Hey, you! - Ji Hyuk!

00:48:29.974 --> 00:48:31.874
- Hey! - Don't go.

00:49:10.244 --> 00:49:11.244
Eun Oh.

00:49:12.944 --> 00:49:13.944
Let go.

00:49:17.084 --> 00:49:18.084
See?

00:49:18.854 --> 00:49:20.554
You were lying.

00:49:21.654 --> 00:49:23.924
You do have feelings for me. This proves it!

00:49:25.664 --> 00:49:26.664
Ji Hyuk.

00:49:28.034 --> 00:49:29.034
Please, just...

00:49:29.834 --> 00:49:31.094
Can't you just stop?

00:49:32.834 --> 00:49:35.504
I told you I really don't care that you're sick.

00:49:57.394 --> 00:49:58.394
What do you think you're doing?

00:49:59.264 --> 00:50:00.264
Team Leader Ji Eun Oh.

00:50:02.394 --> 00:50:05.264
You always get formal like this when you're cornered.

00:50:06.234 --> 00:50:07.404
As if I'd fall for that.

00:50:08.634 --> 00:50:10.004
It was simply human indignation.

00:50:23.514 --> 00:50:24.784
I was right, wasn't I?

00:50:26.184 --> 00:50:27.624
His feelings for me haven't changed.

00:50:29.254 --> 00:50:30.554
I was right.

00:50:33.264 --> 00:50:34.564
You're happy about this?

00:50:35.834 --> 00:50:37.694
Even after that terrifying ordeal with that woman?

00:50:40.664 --> 00:50:41.674
But in return,

00:50:42.704 --> 00:50:44.534
I got to see how he really feels.

00:50:46.374 --> 00:50:47.374
So that's all that matters.

00:50:52.014 --> 00:50:53.014
Hey, Ji Hyuk.

00:50:53.614 --> 00:50:54.614
Seong Jae.

00:50:55.054 --> 00:50:56.814
Aren't you supposed to be protecting Eun Oh's family?

00:50:57.854 --> 00:51:00.254
They're being protected. Why?

00:51:00.424 --> 00:51:03.494
That woman just stormed into Eun Oh's office.

00:51:04.194 --> 00:51:05.194
What?

00:51:08.464 --> 00:51:10.634
AP. Isn't this Ji Eun Oh's company?

00:51:11.134 --> 00:51:12.404
(Eldest son)

00:51:12.464 --> 00:51:16.974
(Shoe Joy, Shoealls)

00:51:17.034 --> 00:51:18.034
Yes?

00:51:18.804 --> 00:51:20.304
Yes, I just got the photo.

00:51:22.574 --> 00:51:23.844
Right. I'll handle it.

00:51:24.474 --> 00:51:25.484
Tell them not to worry.

00:51:26.144 --> 00:51:29.014
(Motel)

00:51:33.854 --> 00:51:35.224
Ji Eun Oh, that venomous cow!

00:51:37.194 --> 00:51:38.194
What do I do?

00:51:39.394 --> 00:51:40.394
What am I going to do now?

00:51:44.134 --> 00:51:45.134
I need to think of something.

00:51:50.074 --> 00:51:51.944
(CEO Park Jin Seok)

00:51:52.004 --> 00:51:53.444
Leave Ji Eun Oh alone.

00:51:54.344 --> 00:51:55.374
Or you're dead.

00:52:09.754 --> 00:52:10.754
I see.

00:52:11.524 --> 00:52:12.524
Park Jin Seok.

00:52:14.864 --> 00:52:17.064
You're trying to back me completely into a corner,

00:52:17.594 --> 00:52:20.034
and make me get on my knees and beg.

00:52:23.334 --> 00:52:24.334
No way.

00:52:25.774 --> 00:52:28.974
If this is how you're going to play, I'll never beg you for anything.

00:52:32.714 --> 00:52:34.584
I won't come crawling back to you.

00:52:40.154 --> 00:52:42.394
- Welcome. - Hi.

00:52:49.864 --> 00:52:52.334
Mom, just pick out whichever one you like.

00:52:52.534 --> 00:52:56.004
They're all so beautiful.

00:52:56.004 --> 00:52:57.904
I don't know which one to choose.

00:52:57.904 --> 00:53:01.104
Just pick one you absolutely love, Ms. Jeong.

00:53:02.214 --> 00:53:06.784
Why did you bring me here? I need to prep for my grand opening.

00:53:07.284 --> 00:53:10.014
To buy you a pair as a gift for your restaurant's grand opening.

00:53:10.414 --> 00:53:11.924
Oh, really?

00:53:12.784 --> 00:53:16.294
If Mr. Ji is running around his own restaurant,

00:53:16.554 --> 00:53:18.024
he'll need comfortable shoes.

00:53:18.694 --> 00:53:20.894
(Shoealls)

00:53:23.364 --> 00:53:25.734
What do you think, Mom? They're so pretty.

00:53:29.474 --> 00:53:30.934
They're comfortable and light.

00:53:31.334 --> 00:53:34.504
- They'll be comfortable all day. - I see.

00:53:35.214 --> 00:53:36.874
I'll take these.

00:53:37.144 --> 00:53:38.144
Sure.

00:53:39.844 --> 00:53:41.954
In that case, I'll get these too. So Mom and I can match.

00:53:43.254 --> 00:53:47.284
Mom, you liked these earlier, right? We'll take these as well, please.

00:53:47.524 --> 00:53:49.854
Oh, no, that's okay, Eun Oh.

00:53:50.294 --> 00:53:52.794
It's because something really good happened to me today.

00:53:52.864 --> 00:53:56.734
- Goodness. - Then can I get another pair?

00:53:57.794 --> 00:54:00.564
Only if you do something for me.

00:54:15.084 --> 00:54:16.184
Hello, Ji Hyuk.

00:54:16.484 --> 00:54:19.324
- I'm Ji Gang Oh, Eun Oh's brother. - Ji Gang Oh?

00:54:19.924 --> 00:54:21.824
I want to ask you something,

00:54:21.824 --> 00:54:23.294
so I'm inviting you to my grand opening.

00:54:23.924 --> 00:54:26.594
Why is this kid inviting me?

00:54:31.464 --> 00:54:33.504
What excuse can I give for not going?

00:54:37.874 --> 00:54:38.904
This weekend?

00:54:40.444 --> 00:54:43.114
I don't have anything planned. Why?

00:54:43.474 --> 00:54:47.014
Su Bin, then, let's go get some delicious beef.

00:54:47.584 --> 00:54:49.754
One of my juniors' younger brothers just opened a restaurant.

00:54:51.954 --> 00:54:54.684
When was the last time we went out just the two of us?

00:54:55.324 --> 00:54:56.324
Or is this a first?

00:54:57.454 --> 00:54:58.464
I guess so.

00:55:00.064 --> 00:55:01.264
This is the first time...

00:55:02.334 --> 00:55:03.334
since you went off to college.

00:55:03.834 --> 00:55:04.934
Lately, there have been more firsts...

00:55:05.604 --> 00:55:06.604
than I expected.

00:55:08.374 --> 00:55:14.604
(Damga Charcoal Grill)

00:55:19.584 --> 00:55:22.314
This place just opened yesterday? The line is pretty long.

00:55:22.614 --> 00:55:23.854
Looks like we'll have to wait a while.

00:55:24.614 --> 00:55:26.284
We have a table. Let's go.

00:55:26.884 --> 00:55:27.884
It's going to be so good.

00:55:28.394 --> 00:55:31.154
- With this current order... - It's three, I'm telling you!

00:55:31.224 --> 00:55:33.964
- No, I'm telling you it's five. - Mom, it's three!

00:55:34.024 --> 00:55:35.234
- No... - Ji Hyuk, you're here.

00:55:35.234 --> 00:55:37.134
- Goodness. Welcome. - Hello.

00:55:37.364 --> 00:55:39.904
Ji Hyuk, you made it!

00:55:40.504 --> 00:55:45.244
- Hey, this is my sister. - I remember you from high school.

00:55:45.444 --> 00:55:46.574
You've gotten even prettier.

00:55:47.274 --> 00:55:48.814
So you're the junior from my brother's club.

00:55:49.074 --> 00:55:50.214
I'm Lee Su Bin.

00:55:50.744 --> 00:55:53.284
Make sure your big brother buys you lots of meat.

00:55:54.584 --> 00:55:56.014
- Mom. - Let's go.

00:55:56.014 --> 00:55:58.584
- Double-check it properly. - I got it.

00:56:00.954 --> 00:56:02.554
Hey, Ji Hyuk.

00:56:05.764 --> 00:56:07.794
Come on. Su Bin, have a seat.

00:56:23.874 --> 00:56:25.484
Ji Hyuk said he was treating me to beef.

00:56:27.114 --> 00:56:28.114
Oh, really?

00:56:28.684 --> 00:56:30.684
I'm here for the grand opening of Eun Oh's brother's restaurant.

00:56:32.424 --> 00:56:35.624
Why are you guys being so awkward? I thought you said it was resolved.

00:56:37.854 --> 00:56:39.324
- It's not awkward. - It's not awkward.

00:56:40.224 --> 00:56:41.464
Oh, really?

00:56:46.304 --> 00:56:47.464
I'll do the ordering.

00:56:48.064 --> 00:56:49.974
I'm going to order one of everything.

00:56:55.074 --> 00:56:56.774
This is so good.

00:57:02.214 --> 00:57:04.884
- Ji Hyuk, do you need anything? - No, we're good.

00:57:05.554 --> 00:57:08.454
Hey, this tastes just like it does at your mother's restaurant.

00:57:09.524 --> 00:57:11.054
That's the seal of approval right there.

00:57:11.554 --> 00:57:15.064
- Don't forget why you started. - I'll take that to heart.

00:57:15.934 --> 00:57:18.734
- Gang Oh, I'm going to grab a bite. - Sure, go ahead.

00:57:20.604 --> 00:57:23.704
Hey, you can't just eat off a customer's table.

00:57:24.234 --> 00:57:25.704
I'm just encouraging you to eat more.

00:57:30.274 --> 00:57:32.844
Here, Eun Oh. You have this first.

00:57:33.184 --> 00:57:34.984
Gosh. Thanks.

00:57:43.594 --> 00:57:46.294
Eun Oh, how do you and Seong Jae know each other?

00:57:47.594 --> 00:57:49.364
We go way back. We're friends.

00:57:52.034 --> 00:57:54.304
Did you also meet Seong Jae through my brother?

00:57:55.904 --> 00:57:56.904
Yes.

00:57:57.234 --> 00:57:59.174
Mr. Vice President, has it been over ten years now?

00:57:59.974 --> 00:58:01.004
Yes.

00:58:05.714 --> 00:58:06.714
Why?

00:58:10.284 --> 00:58:11.584
There's already someone I like.

00:58:11.784 --> 00:58:14.724
I've liked her for a long time. I've clearly said no,

00:58:15.224 --> 00:58:16.754
and I told you there's someone else.

00:58:16.894 --> 00:58:18.624
So that "friend" in the hospital...

00:58:18.624 --> 00:58:21.364
Is she the girl you had a crush on for years?

00:58:22.934 --> 00:58:25.304
Did I really say all that?

00:58:31.874 --> 00:58:33.544
So you two have known each other for over ten years.

00:58:38.844 --> 00:58:40.944
Ji Hyuk, try this. It's not too salty.

00:59:03.504 --> 00:59:07.444
- Eun Oh, can I speak with you? - Mom. You all go ahead and eat.

00:59:12.344 --> 00:59:14.484
Can you excuse me?

00:59:20.424 --> 00:59:22.424
(Damga Charcoal Grill)

00:59:28.394 --> 00:59:31.534
- Where's Ji Hyuk going? - I think he went to the restroom.

00:59:32.264 --> 00:59:34.434
But the restroom is inside.

00:59:48.284 --> 00:59:49.284
Ji Hyuk.

00:59:51.114 --> 00:59:52.124
Ji Hyuk!

00:59:56.594 --> 00:59:59.694
What... But she's not even fully recovered.

01:00:12.304 --> 01:00:13.374
Ji Eun Oh!

01:00:17.644 --> 01:00:20.414
You just had surgery. You shouldn't be running!

01:00:20.584 --> 01:00:23.314
You're always so quick to worry about me,

01:00:24.384 --> 01:00:25.754
so why won't you let me worry about you?

01:00:28.724 --> 01:00:29.724
Because you...

01:00:30.524 --> 01:00:33.464
- That wasn't some minor surgery. - But you're sick too.

01:00:38.164 --> 01:00:39.204
Fine.

01:00:41.734 --> 01:00:42.774
All right.

01:00:45.304 --> 01:00:47.974
So what is it you wanted to say to me?

01:00:51.914 --> 01:00:53.444
Even if it takes a year,

01:00:54.344 --> 01:00:56.554
three years, or even ten years,

01:00:58.284 --> 01:00:59.284
I...

01:01:00.524 --> 01:01:02.494
Until you're completely better,

01:01:03.094 --> 01:01:04.854
I can be by your side.

01:01:10.034 --> 01:01:11.064
You can't do that.

01:01:12.864 --> 01:01:14.234
Yes, I can.

01:01:18.374 --> 01:01:21.274
- You can't. - I'm telling you, I can!

01:01:22.274 --> 01:01:24.744
That's how much I love you.

01:01:25.274 --> 01:01:27.614
I've fallen for you all over again.

01:01:29.084 --> 01:01:31.514
But if you keep pushing me away like this...

01:01:33.354 --> 01:01:34.354
then I...

01:01:34.954 --> 01:01:36.754
have no choice but to wait.

01:01:38.924 --> 01:01:40.964
And that time is just too precious to waste.

01:01:46.834 --> 01:01:48.104
Too precious to waste?

01:01:49.404 --> 01:01:50.774
But I'm already out of time.

01:01:53.504 --> 01:01:55.004
Do you think I'm the kind of person...

01:01:55.344 --> 01:01:58.044
who'd pester you to go on dates while you're sick?

01:01:59.984 --> 01:02:01.214
Let's just...

01:02:02.914 --> 01:02:04.684
look at each other,

01:02:06.224 --> 01:02:07.754
and be by each other's side.

01:02:09.854 --> 01:02:11.354
That's what you did for me.

01:02:12.724 --> 01:02:14.464
Even when I misunderstood you,

01:02:15.294 --> 01:02:17.394
even when I said I hated you and treated you with contempt,

01:02:19.264 --> 01:02:20.764
you always pretended you were fine,

01:02:22.534 --> 01:02:24.404
always put me first,

01:02:25.334 --> 01:02:27.374
and always stayed by my side.

01:02:32.014 --> 01:02:33.014
You're right.

01:02:37.684 --> 01:02:39.054
I loved you,

01:02:42.124 --> 01:02:43.194
I love you now,

01:02:46.024 --> 01:02:47.424
and I want to be by your side.

01:02:54.334 --> 01:02:55.404
But...

01:03:00.804 --> 01:03:01.804
I can't.

01:03:03.944 --> 01:03:05.614
Ji Eun Oh, always so determined.

01:03:10.554 --> 01:03:11.614
You're really going to force me...

01:03:14.824 --> 01:03:17.194
to say the one thing I never wanted to say.

01:03:19.794 --> 01:03:20.794
Eun Oh.

01:03:23.494 --> 01:03:24.594
I'm not just...

01:03:28.534 --> 01:03:30.234
your average patient with heart failure.

01:03:43.454 --> 01:03:45.114
I'm a patient who needs...

01:03:46.654 --> 01:03:47.684
a heart transplant.

01:03:55.394 --> 01:03:56.664
Are you sure you're watching her properly?

01:03:57.964 --> 01:04:01.004
It doesn't make sense for her to be holed up in a motel for three days.

01:04:01.904 --> 01:04:05.234
Yes, sir. I've confirmed food deliveries. She's definitely inside.

01:04:06.674 --> 01:04:08.344
Really? All right, then.

01:04:16.354 --> 01:04:18.284
I can't get a read on her this time.

01:04:20.054 --> 01:04:21.884
Did I miscalculate?

01:04:28.264 --> 01:04:31.294
(Motel)

01:04:40.004 --> 01:04:42.174
All right, everyone. As we teased earlier,

01:04:42.344 --> 01:04:44.774
the star of our "This Will Shock You" segment...

01:04:45.174 --> 01:04:46.814
is right here next to me.

01:04:46.884 --> 01:04:48.284
(Samun TV)

01:04:48.344 --> 01:04:53.224
She looks beautiful, like she's lived a charmed life, doesn't she?

01:04:53.824 --> 01:04:54.824
But you'd be wrong.

01:04:55.954 --> 01:04:57.494
She's someone who desperately needs help...

01:04:57.554 --> 01:04:59.264
from me and all of you.

01:05:00.964 --> 01:05:02.164
Please, go ahead.

01:05:06.404 --> 01:05:07.404
Hello, everyone.

01:05:07.464 --> 01:05:08.634
(Samun TV)

01:05:08.704 --> 01:05:11.204
My name is Ko Seong Hui.

01:05:11.934 --> 01:05:14.744
I am the wife of Chairman Park Jin Seok...

01:05:15.444 --> 01:05:16.774
of the Shoe Joy Group.

01:05:56.254 --> 01:05:59.184
(Our Golden Days)

01:05:59.384 --> 01:06:01.224
How can someone be so vile?

01:06:01.284 --> 01:06:03.854
You were really raised by a monster, weren't you?

01:06:04.024 --> 01:06:07.624
You'll meet someone wonderful one day. I'll pray for you.

01:06:07.694 --> 01:06:08.864
After all, I'm just...

01:06:08.864 --> 01:06:10.034
your best friend's little sister to you now.

01:06:10.094 --> 01:06:13.464
Why are you being so reckless? Father, you're just like her.

01:06:13.604 --> 01:06:16.174
I didn't see this coming. Ko Seong Hui...

01:06:16.274 --> 01:06:17.734
- That's so like you. - This is unbelievable.

01:06:17.874 --> 01:06:22.444
You pushed me this far. You thought I couldn't beat you?

01:06:22.544 --> 01:06:25.414
Goodbye, Park Jin Seok. It's over.

01:06:25.514 --> 01:06:27.114
While I still have time,

01:06:27.344 --> 01:06:30.214
can't we go back to being colleagues so it won't be so hard to see you?

01:06:30.514 --> 01:06:34.124
Eun Oh. Please, just leave me be.
