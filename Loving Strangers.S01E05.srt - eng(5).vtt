00:10:26.550 --> 00:10:27.300
It's Gu Chen.

00:10:34.870 --> 00:10:35.460
Su Gengsheng,

00:10:35.670 --> 00:10:36.700
stop playing dumb with me.

00:10:37.360 --> 00:10:38.460
Why not?

00:10:38.960 --> 00:10:39.700
Investigating bribery

00:10:39.720 --> 00:10:41.010
is Inspection Office's job.

00:10:41.630 --> 00:10:42.820
Those gift cards are evidence.

00:10:43.320 --> 00:10:44.370
How could we let you take them?

00:10:45.480 --> 00:10:45.980
How about this?

00:10:46.870 --> 00:10:48.060
I'll buy a few cards myself,

00:10:48.360 --> 00:10:49.010
swap them one-for-one.

00:10:49.080 --> 00:10:49.460
That works, right?

00:10:49.670 --> 00:10:51.460
You want me to sell you

00:10:51.480 --> 00:10:52.240
criminal evidence?

00:10:53.870 --> 00:10:55.130
I'm not playing word games with you.

00:10:56.320 --> 00:10:57.130
I'm the Vice GM.

00:10:58.120 --> 00:10:59.530
You have to do what I say.

00:11:00.720 --> 00:11:01.370
Sorry, Mr. Pang.

00:11:02.360 --> 00:11:02.980
Inspection Office

00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:04.060
has its own way of handling things.

00:11:12.200 --> 00:11:12.820
Su Gengsheng,

00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:15.610
so the Vice GM doesn't count,

00:11:16.390 --> 00:11:17.340
but the CEO does,

00:11:17.390 --> 00:11:18.610
am I right?

00:11:20.150 --> 00:11:20.650
Mr. Pang,

00:11:21.600 --> 00:11:22.610
I hope you know

00:11:22.630 --> 00:11:23.460
what you're saying.

00:11:27.390 --> 00:11:28.180
I know exactly.

00:12:06.790 --> 00:12:07.300
Boss,

00:12:08.550 --> 00:12:09.460
the hospitals are lined up.

00:12:14.480 --> 00:12:15.300
Hey, did you actually

00:12:15.320 --> 00:12:16.420
explain it clearly?

00:12:16.840 --> 00:12:18.180
We have to hit three hospitals today.

00:12:18.480 --> 00:12:19.010
No car available.

00:12:20.150 --> 00:12:20.980
Can you stop

00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:22.010
spitting out few words at a time?

00:12:22.390 --> 00:12:24.010
Will a full sentence kill you?

00:12:26.840 --> 00:12:28.010
Always pulling that sour face.

00:12:28.550 --> 00:12:28.980
What's with the attitude?

00:12:29.270 --> 00:12:29.850
If I were Admin,

00:12:29.850 --> 00:12:30.850
even with a car, I'd still say no.

00:12:31.530 --> 00:12:32.060
Real funny.

00:12:32.120 --> 00:12:32.530
Boss,

00:12:33.120 --> 00:12:34.130
want me to ask again?

00:12:34.720 --> 00:12:35.340
Let's just get a cab.

00:12:58.360 --> 00:12:59.820
Didn't the forecast say

00:13:00.080 --> 00:13:01.010
today would warm up?

00:13:01.390 --> 00:13:02.340
The sun's out already.

00:13:02.440 --> 00:13:03.730
So why's it still freezing?

00:13:04.120 --> 00:13:05.300
Since when did the forecast

00:13:05.320 --> 00:13:06.250
have to be right?

00:13:06.550 --> 00:13:07.300
And since when

00:13:07.480 --> 00:13:08.980
did sun automatically mean warm?

00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:10.490
Song,

00:13:10.630 --> 00:13:11.530
you're just picking a fight.

00:13:13.320 --> 00:13:13.940
Dong,

00:13:14.120 --> 00:13:15.360
when can we get a ride?

00:13:15.390 --> 00:13:16.700
My phone's about to freeze dead.

00:13:17.080 --> 00:13:17.940
Boss, I'm not complaining,

00:13:18.150 --> 00:13:18.850
but I've been

00:13:18.910 --> 00:13:20.180
with this company for years,

00:13:20.320 --> 00:13:22.100
and I've only used the company car once.

00:13:22.240 --> 00:13:22.890
I almost forgot

00:13:22.910 --> 00:13:24.250
what it even looks like.

00:13:26.080 --> 00:13:27.340
Why don't you walk back yourself?

00:13:27.910 --> 00:13:28.250
Well...

00:13:29.150 --> 00:13:30.130
Give it back to me!

00:13:38.440 --> 00:13:39.250
In this weather,

00:13:39.630 --> 00:13:40.890
aren't they cold in those short socks?

00:13:53.390 --> 00:13:54.580
Fashion and sexy

00:13:54.670 --> 00:13:55.580
keep the cold out.

00:14:07.910 --> 00:14:08.650
Not everyone

00:14:08.670 --> 00:14:09.610
thinks that way.

00:14:37.200 --> 00:14:37.580
Dongshan,

00:14:37.600 --> 00:14:38.940
you played great today.

00:14:39.320 --> 00:14:40.250
Was that kick yours?

00:14:40.510 --> 00:14:41.180
Wide-open goal,

00:14:41.440 --> 00:14:42.420
I think Fei could've caught it.

00:14:42.440 --> 00:14:42.890
Right?

00:14:43.240 --> 00:14:43.820
We didn't even have enough people.

00:14:43.840 --> 00:14:45.180
I was covering two spots by myself.

00:14:45.550 --> 00:14:46.080
Where's Chi?

00:14:46.080 --> 00:14:46.940
I'll call him and chew him out.

00:14:48.150 --> 00:14:48.770
Chi!

00:14:49.030 --> 00:14:50.060
Over here!

00:14:55.080 --> 00:14:55.820
It can't stop!

00:14:56.080 --> 00:14:57.370
Dongshan, run!

00:15:10.060 --> 00:15:12.460
[Yao "Stinky Foot"]

00:15:26.670 --> 00:15:27.770
Let me pat and comfort you.

00:15:28.320 --> 00:15:28.770
It's okay now.

00:15:30.080 --> 00:15:30.460
Yeah.

00:15:30.630 --> 00:15:31.100
Chi,

00:15:31.600 --> 00:15:32.650
you really need to fix that car.

00:15:32.870 --> 00:15:33.460
Or sooner or later,

00:15:33.480 --> 00:15:34.490
you're going to get my uncle killed.

00:15:35.240 --> 00:15:36.010
Hey, Jiang Jialu,

00:15:36.030 --> 00:15:37.420
you really want me dead that bad?

00:15:38.790 --> 00:15:39.980
Today's on me.

00:15:40.030 --> 00:15:40.730
Sooner or later,

00:15:40.750 --> 00:15:41.650
I'll change those brake pads.

00:15:42.240 --> 00:15:43.180
Sorry, I scared you.

00:15:43.320 --> 00:15:44.460
Who got scared? I didn't...

00:15:45.150 --> 00:15:45.650
Chi,

00:15:45.670 --> 00:15:46.370
I saw your van

00:15:46.390 --> 00:15:47.420
got a "For Sale" sign on it.

00:15:47.550 --> 00:15:48.130
What's up?

00:15:48.840 --> 00:15:49.980
Yeah, why are you selling it?

00:15:50.030 --> 00:15:51.100
Nothing...

00:15:51.670 --> 00:15:52.180
What are you thinking?

00:15:52.440 --> 00:15:53.730
So what was it today? I missed it.

00:15:53.910 --> 00:15:54.650
Lose? Win?

00:15:54.670 --> 00:15:55.580
Don't ask the score.

00:15:55.600 --> 00:15:56.530
Don't bring it up.

00:15:56.870 --> 00:15:58.370
You weren't there. Jiaqi wasn't there.

00:15:58.670 --> 00:15:59.130
How were we supposed to play?

00:15:59.840 --> 00:16:00.770
It's you. You can't serve!

00:16:00.840 --> 00:16:01.580
You never could!

00:16:01.790 --> 00:16:02.300
Right?

00:16:03.440 --> 00:16:04.220
Now I know

00:16:04.270 --> 00:16:05.010
why you're selling it.

00:16:07.980 --> 00:16:11.340
[For Sale]

00:16:11.360 --> 00:16:11.850
How much did you win?

00:16:13.240 --> 00:16:13.820
What?

00:16:13.910 --> 00:16:14.940
You think I hit the jackpot?

00:16:15.480 --> 00:16:15.980
No.

00:16:19.960 --> 00:16:21.530
I just switched jobs.

00:16:21.790 --> 00:16:22.340
Switched jobs?

00:16:22.440 --> 00:16:23.100
To what?

00:16:23.360 --> 00:16:23.820
Driver.

00:16:24.120 --> 00:16:25.100
Isn't that still driving?

00:16:25.670 --> 00:16:26.190
Not the same.

00:16:26.190 --> 00:16:27.460
Drivers come in tiers.

00:16:28.150 --> 00:16:28.850
This time I'm driving

00:16:28.870 --> 00:16:30.610
for a government-affiliated unit.

00:16:33.080 --> 00:16:33.980
So you're in the system now.

00:16:34.790 --> 00:16:35.420
How much are they paying?

00:16:35.910 --> 00:16:36.940
4,500 a month.

00:16:37.870 --> 00:16:38.730
That's just so-so.

00:16:39.320 --> 00:16:40.460
You know what!

00:16:41.390 --> 00:16:42.730
The job before has me up early, home late,

00:16:43.080 --> 00:16:44.010
and I have to help carry stuff.

00:16:44.240 --> 00:16:45.610
My back can't take it.

00:16:46.120 --> 00:16:46.850
Let's do the math.

00:16:47.390 --> 00:16:48.700
Yeah, the pay's low now,

00:16:49.120 --> 00:16:49.940
but it's legit.

00:16:50.720 --> 00:16:51.890
Once the contract's signed,

00:16:52.550 --> 00:16:53.370
you get full benefits.

00:16:53.870 --> 00:16:54.340
And then,

00:16:54.630 --> 00:16:55.730
holidays, festivals,

00:16:56.080 --> 00:16:56.850
all the perks are there.

00:16:57.320 --> 00:16:58.370
There's a year-end bonus too.

00:16:58.630 --> 00:17:00.300
Most importantly, it's steady and easy.

00:17:00.750 --> 00:17:01.650
When the boss clocks out, I clock out.

00:17:01.670 --> 00:17:02.490
Doesn't mess with my drinking.

00:17:03.390 --> 00:17:04.330
Nice.

00:17:05.030 --> 00:17:06.290
So you got a connection?

00:17:07.000 --> 00:17:08.730
My cousin works at City Hall.

00:17:09.070 --> 00:17:10.330
He put in a word early,

00:17:10.640 --> 00:17:11.730
so I got ready.

00:17:12.720 --> 00:17:13.900
Then talk to your cousin for me.

00:17:14.240 --> 00:17:14.980
Get me in too.

00:17:15.270 --> 00:17:16.050
Jialu and I will go together.

00:17:17.200 --> 00:17:17.810
You serious?

00:17:19.400 --> 00:17:19.810
Alright then!

00:17:19.960 --> 00:17:21.010
We're tight, us three!

00:17:21.920 --> 00:17:22.530
I'm not going.

00:17:23.200 --> 00:17:23.980
If you want it, go yourself.

00:17:28.590 --> 00:17:29.620
I'll reach out for you tonight.

00:17:31.350 --> 00:17:32.010
Solid, right?

00:17:34.070 --> 00:17:34.980
Let me pick up the tab!

00:17:41.200 --> 00:17:42.570
Alright, enough. The interview's starting.

00:17:51.590 --> 00:17:52.380
Yao Dongshan!

00:17:52.790 --> 00:17:53.250
Here!

00:17:56.270 --> 00:17:57.090
Dude, hold this for me.

00:18:03.920 --> 00:18:04.770
Hello, sirs.

00:18:06.590 --> 00:18:07.050
Have a sit.

00:18:14.480 --> 00:18:16.090
Why do you think you're a good fit

00:18:16.350 --> 00:18:17.250
for this position?

00:18:17.640 --> 00:18:18.490
I'm in great shape,

00:18:19.440 --> 00:18:20.180
full of energy,

00:18:20.680 --> 00:18:21.530
especially at night.

00:18:22.160 --> 00:18:23.900
I can get up early and stay up late.

00:18:24.830 --> 00:18:25.530
I...

00:18:25.720 --> 00:18:27.420
I'm even-tempered and have a good sense of humor.

00:18:28.030 --> 00:18:29.810
Nineteen years behind the wheel,

00:18:30.350 --> 00:18:31.380
zero violations,

00:18:31.550 --> 00:18:33.090
not a single point off my license.

00:18:34.880 --> 00:18:35.900
I think this job

00:18:36.240 --> 00:18:38.220
was made for me!

00:18:40.030 --> 00:18:40.620
Very good.

00:18:47.760 --> 00:18:48.220
Mr. Gu.

00:18:48.350 --> 00:18:49.140
- Mr. Gao. - Mr. Gu.

00:18:49.180 --> 00:18:49.810
Mr. Gu.

00:18:54.010 --> 00:18:54.820
Mr. Gu. Mr. Gao.

00:18:58.280 --> 00:18:59.490
No idea what kind of spell

00:18:59.510 --> 00:19:00.620
he cast on the chairman.

00:19:01.270 --> 00:19:02.770
For something this big with Commissioner Du,

00:19:03.070 --> 00:19:04.180
the chairman sent him.

00:19:09.350 --> 00:19:09.770
Mr. Pang,

00:19:11.480 --> 00:19:11.980
thanks for your hard work.

00:19:13.200 --> 00:19:13.940
Just doing my job.

00:19:16.750 --> 00:19:17.570
If only you really knew

00:19:17.680 --> 00:19:19.090
