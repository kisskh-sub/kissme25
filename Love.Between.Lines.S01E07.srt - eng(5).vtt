[Episode 7]

00:01:59.000 --> 00:01:59.840
Ms. Wang,

00:02:00.760 --> 00:02:01.820
congratulations,

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:02.710
really.

00:02:04.120 --> 00:02:05.000
Thank you.

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:06.950
To be honest with you,

00:02:07.120 --> 00:02:09.630
I didn't expect to get married so early.

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:12.330
I was actually afraid of marriage before.

00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:15.030
Indeed.

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:18.490
Flash marriage, in particular,
needs more courage.

00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:19.590
Flash marriage?

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:22.360
How do you know that?

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:26.400
I...

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:27.640
Keep in touch.

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:29.250
Please stay for a while.

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:30.310
Let me add you on WeChat.

00:02:30.310 --> 00:02:30.870
Okay.

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:31.320
Okay.

00:02:31.870 --> 00:02:32.310
Okay.

00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:32.710
Okay.

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:40.030
Liang,

00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:41.400
take care of everyone for me.

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:41.870
Go ahead.

00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:42.430
Go ahead. Go ahead.

00:02:42.430 --> 00:02:43.090
Okay. Okay.

00:02:56.710 --> 00:02:57.280
Congratulations.

00:02:57.280 --> 00:02:58.030
Your son married into a good family.

00:02:58.030 --> 00:02:59.190
Congratulations.

00:02:59.870 --> 00:03:01.000
Thanks to you.

00:03:01.590 --> 00:03:02.190
I'm so jealous.

00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:02.870
Son!

00:03:02.870 --> 00:03:03.150
Yes.

00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:03.800
Son!

00:03:05.150 --> 00:03:06.080
He's too busy to hear me.

00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:06.960
Wait for me.

00:03:06.980 --> 00:03:07.770
Okay. Okay.

00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:08.730
Qiran.

00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:10.150
What were you doing?

00:03:10.150 --> 00:03:11.520
You didn't answer when I called you.

00:03:11.520 --> 00:03:12.590
Auntie Xu and others are here.

00:03:12.590 --> 00:03:13.520
Go and say hello.

00:03:15.820 --> 00:03:16.620
Hu Xiu is here.

00:03:17.520 --> 00:03:18.150
Hu Xiu?

00:03:18.579 --> 00:03:19.820
Why is she here?

00:03:20.470 --> 00:03:21.670
Does she know that...

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:23.970
How about this?

00:03:23.970 --> 00:03:25.380
Go and attend to the guests.

00:03:25.380 --> 00:03:26.380
Leave Hu Xiu to me.

00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:28.500
I won't let her ruin your wedding.

00:04:10.980 --> 00:04:11.980
Flash marriage?

00:04:13.070 --> 00:04:14.630
How do you know that?

00:04:15.270 --> 00:04:17.320
But I don't think

00:04:17.350 --> 00:04:18.810
it's an accurate description.

00:04:18.810 --> 00:04:20.750
We've known each other for over a year.

00:04:20.750 --> 00:04:22.390
We dated

00:04:22.390 --> 00:04:24.650
for more than half a year
to decide on our marriage.

00:04:24.650 --> 00:04:25.530
Half a year?

00:04:26.190 --> 00:04:26.830
Yes.

00:04:27.120 --> 00:04:27.920
A while back,

00:04:27.940 --> 00:04:29.210
he gave up everything in Shanghai

00:04:29.210 --> 00:04:30.610
and came to Suzhou for me.

00:04:30.950 --> 00:04:32.470
He did really well.

00:04:32.780 --> 00:04:35.040
That's why my dad agreed to our marriage.

00:04:35.220 --> 00:04:37.290
I told him to arrange the wedding
as soon as possible,

00:04:37.290 --> 00:04:39.550
so that my dad wouldn't keep testing him.

00:04:58.650 --> 00:05:00.160
Send the tablet and information in the bag

00:05:00.160 --> 00:05:03.160
to the conference room
on the third floor of the hotel.

00:05:07.070 --> 00:05:09.800
Is he here for the Lyman project?

00:05:10.750 --> 00:05:11.520
Hold it.

00:05:11.960 --> 00:05:13.440
Don't ruin the business.

00:05:23.560 --> 00:05:24.560
Is anyone there?

00:05:24.700 --> 00:05:26.700
This door is broken. I can't open it!

[Is Being Inspected and Repaired]

00:05:32.830 --> 00:05:33.310
[Mr. Xiao]

00:05:37.950 --> 00:05:40.610
You're here
for the design competition's sake?

00:05:41.110 --> 00:05:41.720
Yes.

00:05:42.900 --> 00:05:45.230
Your studio has already been eliminated.

00:05:45.500 --> 00:05:47.360
Letting you rejoin the competition

00:05:47.360 --> 00:05:49.360
would be unfair to other companies.

00:05:50.920 --> 00:05:52.960
When this island was being developed,

00:05:52.960 --> 00:05:54.820
Mr. Wang invited many designers.

00:05:56.150 --> 00:05:57.350
But they all refused.

00:05:58.870 --> 00:06:00.200
So why did you accept it?

00:06:01.360 --> 00:06:03.420
Precisely because they all refused.

00:06:04.750 --> 00:06:05.800
In others' eyes,

00:06:06.370 --> 00:06:07.770
this was just wasteland.

00:06:07.930 --> 00:06:10.060
But the more something is overlooked,

00:06:11.080 --> 00:06:13.140
the more it deserves to be redefined.

00:06:18.150 --> 00:06:18.830
Mr. Xie.

00:06:20.990 --> 00:06:21.640
Mr. Xie?

00:06:23.210 --> 00:06:23.920
I'm sorry.

00:06:25.580 --> 00:06:28.040
You just reminded me
of someone from my past.

00:06:28.430 --> 00:06:30.430
Is that person your friend, Mr. Xie?

00:06:32.960 --> 00:06:33.960
I suppose so.

00:06:47.920 --> 00:06:49.580
It'll be late if I don't go now.

00:08:00.390 --> 00:08:03.790
What does the island project have to do
with the competition?

00:08:04.070 --> 00:08:05.530
What are you trying to say?

00:08:06.250 --> 00:08:07.810
I want to know your choice—

00:08:08.560 --> 00:08:10.020
will you stick to the rules

00:08:10.280 --> 00:08:10.890
or choose

00:08:10.920 --> 00:08:12.430
a truly valuable design?

00:08:13.350 --> 00:08:14.210
All right then.

00:08:14.350 --> 00:08:15.440
Show me

00:08:15.470 --> 00:08:17.060
what you've got.

00:08:18.680 --> 00:08:21.940
Since you're here,
you didn't come empty-handed, did you?

00:08:22.880 --> 00:08:24.140
Just a moment, please.

00:08:33.659 --> 00:08:34.539
Mr. Xiao.

00:08:39.820 --> 00:08:40.890
I'm sorry, Mr. Xiao.

00:08:40.890 --> 00:08:41.799
I'm late.

00:08:49.330 --> 00:08:50.040
Take a look.

00:08:55.910 --> 00:08:56.580
Hu Xiu.

00:08:57.160 --> 00:08:58.220
After dawn breaks,

00:08:58.240 --> 00:09:00.240
don't think about the past anymore.

00:09:00.270 --> 00:09:01.790
Our only goal now

00:09:02.160 --> 00:09:04.020
is Lyman's competition project.

00:09:12.940 --> 00:09:14.720
Building architecture
is just about winning awards.

00:09:14.720 --> 00:09:16.050
You said that yourself?

00:09:17.340 --> 00:09:18.170
Yes, I did.

00:09:20.850 --> 00:09:22.180
My goal in architecture

00:09:22.530 --> 00:09:23.770
does partly involve

00:09:23.790 --> 00:09:25.080
impressing the judges

00:09:25.380 --> 00:09:26.510
and winning awards.

00:09:28.010 --> 00:09:29.810
Every line drawn by an architect

00:09:30.130 --> 00:09:30.990
is a statement.

00:09:31.200 --> 00:09:32.260
And winning awards

00:09:32.930 --> 00:09:35.390
is the best challenge
to break conventions.

00:09:37.370 --> 00:09:38.320
I understand that this statement

00:09:38.320 --> 00:09:39.560
might cause controversy,

00:09:39.560 --> 00:09:42.290
and I respect others'
different interpretations.

00:09:42.290 --> 00:09:43.680
But I've never felt

00:09:44.170 --> 00:09:45.970
that wanting awards
and creating good architecture

00:09:45.970 --> 00:09:47.440
are in any way contradictory.

00:09:47.440 --> 00:09:48.440
That's my answer.

00:09:52.720 --> 00:09:54.520
As expected from a young person,

00:09:54.960 --> 00:09:55.890
ambitious

00:09:56.170 --> 00:09:57.010
and driven.

00:09:57.530 --> 00:09:59.720
Am I, as an old man, appearing

00:09:59.720 --> 00:10:00.920
a bit narrow-minded?

00:10:12.200 --> 00:10:12.960
Thank you.

00:10:14.580 --> 00:10:15.870
What happened to you?

00:10:20.320 --> 00:10:21.250
It's nothing.

00:10:21.560 --> 00:10:23.400
I just took a fall.

00:10:24.600 --> 00:10:25.290
Where are your shoes?

00:10:25.290 --> 00:10:26.620
Where did you lose them?

00:10:28.290 --> 00:10:29.170
Forget it.

00:10:29.290 --> 00:10:30.550
Don't bother looking.

What are you thinking about?

00:10:44.900 --> 00:10:46.780
You knew Mr. Xie was coming today.

00:10:49.170 --> 00:10:51.300
I asked Mr. Wang for help to invite him.

00:10:51.650 --> 00:10:53.770

Hu Xiu.

00:11:31.960 --> 00:11:33.290
What exactly happened?

00:11:34.530 --> 00:11:35.440
I'm just

00:11:36.320 --> 00:11:37.080
tired.

00:11:38.210 --> 00:11:39.990
Besides, going to the wedding
dressed like this

00:11:39.990 --> 00:11:41.330
would be too embarrassing.

00:11:41.330 --> 00:11:42.730
Mr. Xie will be there too.

00:11:44.880 --> 00:11:46.540
You're overthinking things.

00:11:47.930 --> 00:11:49.330
Wait for me near the dock.

00:11:49.600 --> 00:11:50.530
Don't go too far.

00:12:10.490 --> 00:12:11.920
This is ridiculous.

00:12:16.180 --> 00:12:17.150
That person

00:12:17.170 --> 00:12:18.320
should be gone by now, right?

00:12:18.320 --> 00:12:18.800
Who?

00:12:19.250 --> 00:12:20.080
Hu Xiu.

00:12:20.140 --> 00:12:22.080
I just saw Qiran's mother following her

00:12:22.080 --> 00:12:23.140
to the lounge area.

00:12:23.340 --> 00:12:24.220
Hu Xiu is here?

00:12:24.530 --> 00:12:25.140
No way.

00:12:25.640 --> 00:12:29.240
Zhang Qiran actually invited
his ex-girlfriend to the wedding?

00:12:47.230 --> 00:12:47.990
Mr. Xiao.

00:12:50.060 --> 00:12:50.590
Let's go.

00:12:51.530 --> 00:12:52.320
Where to?

00:12:54.730 --> 00:12:55.930
To the wedding venue.

00:13:00.130 --> 00:13:01.170
Wang Yue's groom

00:13:01.290 --> 00:13:02.740
is the one who broke off the engagement
with you,

00:13:02.740 --> 00:13:03.260
right?

00:13:04.900 --> 00:13:05.780
How do you know?

00:13:06.450 --> 00:13:08.250
I just went to the security room.

00:13:08.910 --> 00:13:10.690
The person who locked you
in the lounge area

00:13:10.690 --> 00:13:12.150
was Zhang Qiran's mother.

00:13:17.410 --> 00:13:17.960
Hu Xiu.

00:13:19.320 --> 00:13:21.720
If you're doing this
for the sake of the studio,

00:13:21.720 --> 00:13:23.850
I suggest you don't flatter yourself.

00:13:23.930 --> 00:13:24.800
My reputation

00:13:24.800 --> 00:13:26.320
won't be damaged

00:13:26.350 --> 00:13:27.960
just because you don't have
the right shoes.

00:13:27.960 --> 00:13:28.650
But if

00:13:29.890 --> 00:13:31.530
you've been treated unfairly

00:13:31.530 --> 00:13:33.930
and still think
you should swallow your pride,

00:13:33.930 --> 00:13:36.790
believing that you're the one
who should hide away,

00:13:37.850 --> 00:13:40.110
then just stay here and enjoy the breeze.

00:14:04.170 --> 00:14:05.930
Today, we gather here

00:14:05.930 --> 00:14:07.480
to witness

00:14:07.480 --> 00:14:10.010
this important moment for the couple.

00:14:10.530 --> 00:14:11.680
I now declare

00:14:12.010 --> 00:14:13.080
that Ms. Wang Yue

00:14:13.080 --> 00:14:15.890
and Mr. Zhang Qiran's wedding ceremony

00:14:16.020 --> 00:14:18.110
officially begins.

00:14:30.540 --> 00:14:32.290
Look how perfect they are together.

00:14:32.290 --> 00:14:34.080
Yes, they're a perfect match.

00:14:34.290 --> 00:14:35.050
Qiran,

00:14:35.650 --> 00:14:37.290
I'm entrusting Wang Yue to you.

00:14:37.290 --> 00:14:38.450
Don't worry, Dad.

00:14:44.370 --> 00:14:46.010
-Good!
-Good!

00:14:49.030 --> 00:14:49.910
Mr. Zhang,

00:14:50.480 --> 00:14:53.930

I do.

Now, Ms. Wang,

00:14:57.680 --> 00:15:01.200

00:15:01.600 --> 00:15:02.360

-Congratulations.

Thanks and congratulations.

00:17:31.610 --> 00:17:33.410
Mr. Wang, congratulations.

00:17:34.000 --> 00:17:34.680
Having a good time today?

00:17:34.680 --> 00:17:35.880
Thank you. Thank you.

00:17:44.610 --> 00:17:45.200
Renzi.

00:17:46.200 --> 00:17:46.890
Qiran.

00:17:47.410 --> 00:17:49.270
I'll take the kids to make a toast.

00:17:49.370 --> 00:17:50.010
Alright. Alright.

00:17:50.010 --> 00:17:50.400
Dad.

00:17:51.090 --> 00:17:51.890
Auntie Zhang.

00:17:51.930 --> 00:17:52.720
Okay. Okay.

00:17:55.440 --> 00:17:56.040
Mr. Xiao.

00:17:57.170 --> 00:17:58.400
Ladies and gentlemen,

00:17:58.400 --> 00:18:00.390
thank you all for attending
my daughter's wedding.

00:18:00.390 --> 00:18:02.090
I'm here with my daughter and son-in-law

00:18:02.090 --> 00:18:03.330
to toast to all of you.

00:18:03.480 --> 00:18:04.520
Thank you for coming.

00:18:04.520 --> 00:18:04.980
Cheers.

00:18:05.080 --> 00:18:06.010
You're too kind.

00:18:06.850 --> 00:18:07.440
Here.

00:18:07.770 --> 00:18:08.970
Thank you. Thank you.

00:18:13.810 --> 00:18:14.410
Mr. Xiao,

00:18:15.200 --> 00:18:16.660
hope we can get along well.

00:18:19.000 --> 00:18:19.730
Is that okay?

00:18:27.130 --> 00:18:28.280
Of course.

00:18:35.480 --> 00:18:36.240
Ms. Hu,

00:18:36.790 --> 00:18:38.590
what's going on with your shoes?

00:18:38.890 --> 00:18:41.350
Why don't I have someone
bring you a new pair?

00:18:41.810 --> 00:18:43.000
Yes, Yue,

00:18:43.170 --> 00:18:44.520
I think you should have someone

00:18:44.520 --> 00:18:46.180
take her to the changing room.

00:18:46.240 --> 00:18:47.840
I think the way she's dressed

00:18:47.880 --> 00:18:50.330
might not be appropriate
for this occasion.

00:18:50.330 --> 00:18:51.170
Yes, indeed.

00:18:51.370 --> 00:18:52.130
I'll take you to change your shoes.

00:18:52.130 --> 00:18:53.330
It is inappropriate.

00:18:59.280 --> 00:19:01.090
So I hope this lady

00:19:01.200 --> 00:19:02.800
will return my date's shoes.

00:19:06.930 --> 00:19:08.020
S-Shoes?

00:19:08.170 --> 00:19:09.170
What shoes?

00:19:09.820 --> 00:19:10.750
How would I know?

00:19:12.290 --> 00:19:13.240
Mr. Xiao, I think

00:19:13.340 --> 00:19:14.810
there might be some misunderstanding.

00:19:14.810 --> 00:19:16.000
Whether it's a misunderstanding,

00:19:16.000 --> 00:19:17.200
your mother

00:19:17.370 --> 00:19:18.410
knows perfectly well.

00:19:18.410 --> 00:19:18.810
Well,

00:19:18.890 --> 00:19:20.090
what's going on here?

00:19:20.720 --> 00:19:21.200
Dad,

00:19:21.440 --> 00:19:23.330
I don't really understand

00:19:23.330 --> 00:19:25.130
what Mr. Xiao was talking about.

00:19:25.200 --> 00:19:27.040
I just checked the security footage.

00:19:27.040 --> 00:19:28.040
This lady

00:19:28.280 --> 00:19:29.480
locked my date

00:19:29.480 --> 00:19:31.280
in the lounge area for no reason,

00:19:31.520 --> 00:19:33.520
forcing her to climb out the window.

00:19:33.720 --> 00:19:34.610
I'd like to know

00:19:34.960 --> 00:19:36.290
what on earth happened.

00:19:37.720 --> 00:19:38.570
Is this true?

00:19:40.930 --> 00:19:42.330
I didn't do it on purpose.

00:19:42.520 --> 00:19:43.930
It's just a lounge area.

00:19:44.090 --> 00:19:46.040
How could I know if anyone was inside?

00:19:46.040 --> 00:19:48.080
It should be locked if no one's inside.

00:19:48.080 --> 00:19:49.540
Are you here for a wedding,

00:19:50.600 --> 00:19:52.330
or are you a hotel staff member?

00:19:54.480 --> 00:19:55.650
What's exactly going on?

00:19:55.650 --> 00:19:57.100
You know Ms. Hu?

00:19:59.650 --> 00:20:00.280
Yue.

00:20:01.260 --> 00:20:02.260
Actually, Dad...

00:20:02.440 --> 00:20:03.850
I was his fiancée

00:20:06.370 --> 00:20:08.930
until he suddenly broke up with me
3 months ago.

00:20:08.930 --> 00:20:09.610
What?

00:20:15.400 --> 00:20:16.570
Three months ago?

00:20:17.480 --> 00:20:18.410
No, darling.

00:20:20.670 --> 00:20:21.960
When it comes to relationships,

00:20:21.960 --> 00:20:23.360
things are never simple.

00:20:23.410 --> 00:20:25.090
I never expected that after we split,

00:20:25.090 --> 00:20:26.000
I would so quickly meet

00:20:26.000 --> 00:20:27.330
the person I truly love.

00:20:27.370 --> 00:20:27.810
No.

00:20:27.960 --> 00:20:28.720
Mom, Dad,

00:20:28.780 --> 00:20:30.380
I really love your daughter.

00:20:30.650 --> 00:20:31.440
You don't actually think

00:20:31.440 --> 00:20:32.930
that calling your two-timing

00:20:32.930 --> 00:20:34.170
a seamless transition
to a new relationship

00:20:34.170 --> 00:20:35.770
makes you look noble, do you?

00:20:36.180 --> 00:20:38.940
You waited until the engagement day
to break up,

00:20:38.960 --> 00:20:41.410
then disappeared without any apology.

00:20:43.280 --> 00:20:46.810
Zhang Qiran, how can you
live with yourself being so shameless?

00:20:47.280 --> 00:20:48.090
No, Dad.

00:20:50.480 --> 00:20:51.000
Yue.

00:20:52.040 --> 00:20:53.410
I'm sorry

00:20:53.650 --> 00:20:55.310
for disrupting your wedding.

00:20:56.090 --> 00:20:57.090
But I'm also grateful

00:20:57.090 --> 00:20:58.720
that I came here today.

00:20:59.480 --> 00:21:01.240
Heaven helped me see the truth.

00:21:02.630 --> 00:21:04.490
I hope you can cut your losses now.

00:21:09.440 --> 00:21:10.200
Qiran.

00:21:14.050 --> 00:21:14.640
Yue.

00:21:14.800 --> 00:21:15.320
Dad.

00:21:23.120 --> 00:21:24.470
Zhang Qiran, you jerk!

00:21:24.720 --> 00:21:25.890
How dare you lie to me?

00:21:25.890 --> 00:21:28.010
You made me the other woman
without me knowing!

00:21:28.010 --> 00:21:29.000
Let me explain.

00:21:29.000 --> 00:21:30.400
What else is there to say?

00:21:30.970 --> 00:21:33.300
Qiran had no feelings for her long ago.

00:21:33.480 --> 00:21:34.720
It's just that he was too soft-hearted,

00:21:34.720 --> 00:21:36.650
so he kept putting off telling her.

00:21:59.920 --> 00:22:01.090
I-I'll handle this myself.

00:22:01.090 --> 00:22:01.760
Don't move.

00:22:26.480 --> 00:22:27.570
Thank you.

00:22:38.370 --> 00:22:39.300
Let me carry you.

00:22:39.780 --> 00:22:40.990
No, I...

00:22:41.020 --> 00:22:41.740
I...

00:22:41.920 --> 00:22:42.570
Get on.

00:23:01.610 --> 00:23:02.370
Hold tight.

00:23:13.850 --> 00:23:15.170
Will what happened today

00:23:15.170 --> 00:23:17.240
affect your relationship

00:23:17.240 --> 00:23:18.280
with the client?

00:23:19.810 --> 00:23:20.480
Maybe.

00:23:26.370 --> 00:23:27.130
Worst case,

00:23:28.410 --> 00:23:31.010
I'll design something award-winning
for him.

00:24:00.170 --> 00:24:00.890
Where do you live?

00:24:00.890 --> 00:24:01.950
I'll take you home.

00:24:02.850 --> 00:24:05.200
Just drop me off
at the murder mystery game club.

00:24:05.200 --> 00:24:05.930
Thanks.

00:24:06.570 --> 00:24:07.440
Your foot is in this condition,

00:24:07.440 --> 00:24:09.520
and you still want to play
murder mystery games?

00:24:09.520 --> 00:24:11.980
Besides, it's too late
for the last session.

00:24:28.440 --> 00:24:30.000
That's my best friend's café.

00:24:30.000 --> 00:24:30.960
I live upstairs.

00:24:31.600 --> 00:24:34.000
If there's nothing else,
I'll be going now.

00:24:34.440 --> 00:24:35.570
You don't look well.

00:24:39.650 --> 00:24:41.850
I probably haven't had time
to eat all day.

00:24:41.850 --> 00:24:44.050
I'll feel better after I eat something.

00:24:44.760 --> 00:24:45.960
What about your foot?

00:24:46.150 --> 00:24:47.950
It's much better after resting.

00:25:41.590 --> 00:25:44.040
[Opening Hours]

00:26:00.610 --> 00:26:01.480
Zhao.

00:26:02.480 --> 00:26:03.810
What are you doing here?

00:26:03.850 --> 00:26:05.570
Your colleague called me,
saying you had a stomachache

00:26:05.570 --> 00:26:06.610
and injured your foot.

00:26:06.610 --> 00:26:07.680
Let me see where it is.

00:26:07.680 --> 00:26:08.570
Colleague?

00:26:11.040 --> 00:26:11.760
Here?

00:26:12.570 --> 00:26:13.490
It's nothing.

00:26:17.850 --> 00:26:19.040
When I got upstairs

00:26:19.410 --> 00:26:20.940
and saw the lights were off,

00:26:21.130 --> 00:26:22.240
I thought something else
had happened to you.

00:26:22.240 --> 00:26:23.480
You scared me to death.

00:26:23.480 --> 00:26:24.810
Speaking of the lights,

00:26:24.960 --> 00:26:27.760
do you know the electricity bill
hasn't been paid?

00:26:27.760 --> 00:26:30.000
Send me the payment details quickly,

00:26:30.030 --> 00:26:31.760
so it'll be easier for me to live here.

00:26:31.760 --> 00:26:32.170
Sure.

00:26:32.170 --> 00:26:33.530
I'll send them to you later.

00:26:33.530 --> 00:26:35.480
I'll make up the medicine with hot water.

00:26:35.480 --> 00:26:38.210
It'll warm your stomach
and make you feel better.

00:26:38.480 --> 00:26:39.650
Later, you need to tell me

00:26:39.650 --> 00:26:41.650
what exactly happened to your foot.

00:26:48.860 --> 00:26:51.200
Zhang Qiran is really a piece of work.

00:26:51.520 --> 00:26:53.570
Why didn't you curse him out more?

00:26:53.930 --> 00:26:55.960
You should have yelled at him

00:26:55.960 --> 00:26:58.560
and pointed at his face,
calling him a scumbag.

00:27:00.100 --> 00:27:01.820
I actually thought before

00:27:02.200 --> 00:27:03.090
that our breakup

00:27:03.090 --> 00:27:05.000
might have been partly my fault.

00:27:06.040 --> 00:27:07.890
But today I found out

00:27:08.370 --> 00:27:11.570
I was just his placeholder
until he found someone better.

00:27:11.850 --> 00:27:13.740
So I had nothing more to say.

00:27:15.440 --> 00:27:17.280
And the one who should be cursing him out
shouldn't be me;

00:27:17.280 --> 00:27:18.480
it should be Ms. Wang.

00:27:19.000 --> 00:27:20.800
I could tell from so many details

00:27:21.000 --> 00:27:22.810
that she was really looking forward to

00:27:22.810 --> 00:27:24.610
and excited about this wedding.

00:27:25.720 --> 00:27:28.720
She never expected something like this
would happen.

00:27:36.850 --> 00:27:37.440
Xiu.

00:27:38.130 --> 00:27:39.260
Think of it this way:

00:27:39.480 --> 00:27:40.330
Zhang Qiran

00:27:40.330 --> 00:27:42.280
is like what you call in architecture,

00:27:42.280 --> 00:27:43.480
a dangerous building.

00:27:43.480 --> 00:27:45.000
If you or Ms. Wang

00:27:45.370 --> 00:27:46.680
wants to deal with him,

00:27:46.680 --> 00:27:48.330
you'd need department approvals,

00:27:48.330 --> 00:27:49.170
institutional assessments,

00:27:49.170 --> 00:27:50.900
and all sorts of certificates.

00:27:51.410 --> 00:27:52.650
When you've lived in a house
for a long time,

00:27:52.650 --> 00:27:54.250
you develop feelings for it.

00:27:54.440 --> 00:27:56.520
During that long waiting process,

00:27:56.890 --> 00:27:58.490
you might soften your heart.

00:27:58.890 --> 00:27:59.810
But now,

00:28:01.330 --> 00:28:03.440
even heaven can't stand it anymore.

00:28:03.650 --> 00:28:04.960
It was afraid falling bricks

00:28:04.960 --> 00:28:05.930
and the wind coming in

00:28:05.930 --> 00:28:07.060
would make you sick.

00:28:07.440 --> 00:28:09.500
So it just demolished it completely.

00:28:10.480 --> 00:28:11.570
All you need to do

00:28:12.040 --> 00:28:13.760
is rebuild on this land.

00:28:18.890 --> 00:28:20.240
How did I not notice

00:28:20.610 --> 00:28:22.570
you're so good at comforting people?

00:28:22.570 --> 00:28:25.500
No wonder you can come up with 6 names
for your coffee.

00:28:26.240 --> 00:28:26.960
Come on,

00:28:26.960 --> 00:28:27.890
I came up with 6 names

00:28:27.890 --> 00:28:29.490
just so you could choose one.

00:28:34.830 --> 00:28:36.180
Is my foot swollen?

00:28:36.930 --> 00:28:39.390
I'll get some coffee
to reduce the swelling.

00:28:39.650 --> 00:28:41.200
How does coffee reduce swelling?

00:28:41.200 --> 00:28:42.130
For a foot soak?

00:28:42.480 --> 00:28:43.000
Right.

00:28:43.200 --> 00:28:44.400
It works really well.

00:28:45.200 --> 00:28:47.240
Why don't we use
your most expensive coffee?

00:28:47.240 --> 00:28:48.330
Sure, that works.

00:28:58.930 --> 00:28:59.570
Mr. Xiao,

00:28:59.930 --> 00:29:00.480
morning.

00:29:01.330 --> 00:29:01.960
Morning.

00:29:04.080 --> 00:29:04.670
Mr. Xiao.

00:29:07.520 --> 00:29:08.480
I have good news.

00:29:12.280 --> 00:29:13.000
Everyone,

00:29:13.520 --> 00:29:15.320
please pause what you're doing.

00:29:15.810 --> 00:29:17.540
I have an announcement to make.

00:29:17.600 --> 00:29:19.920
We just received an email from Lyman.

00:29:20.000 --> 00:29:21.520
Our competition qualification

00:29:21.520 --> 00:29:22.610
has been restored!

00:29:24.650 --> 00:29:25.860
Our plan is correct!

00:29:26.650 --> 00:29:27.240
It isn't in vain!

00:29:27.240 --> 00:29:28.570
Right, it isn't in vain!

00:29:28.960 --> 00:29:30.720
-Keep going!
-Keep going!

00:29:31.350 --> 00:29:32.110
Let's work!

00:29:32.360 --> 00:29:33.000
Alright!

00:29:33.310 --> 00:29:33.720
Let's get to work!

00:29:33.720 --> 00:29:34.250
Let's go.

00:29:37.520 --> 00:29:38.280
Sun,

00:29:38.460 --> 00:29:39.860
why isn't Mr. Jiang here?

00:29:40.570 --> 00:29:41.430
He's resigned.

00:29:42.610 --> 00:29:43.610
That's so sudden.

00:29:52.200 --> 00:29:54.090
After the disqualification news came out,

00:29:54.090 --> 00:29:56.550
he submitted his resignation
within 2 days.

00:29:57.340 --> 00:29:59.000
I thought he was just taking a leave.

00:29:59.000 --> 00:30:00.370
Not at all.

00:30:01.240 --> 00:30:01.850
That architecture forum

00:30:01.850 --> 00:30:03.610
where Mr. Xiao's recording was leaked,

00:30:03.610 --> 00:30:05.540
haven't you checked it for a while?

00:30:06.170 --> 00:30:07.850
Some comments made me angry.

00:30:07.960 --> 00:30:09.960
I haven't checked it for a long time.

00:30:10.370 --> 00:30:11.200
These days,

00:30:11.370 --> 00:30:13.880
there are suddenly many posts
about Jiang Tianyi,

00:30:13.880 --> 00:30:14.760
saying that he is

00:30:14.760 --> 00:30:16.680
the mole in Dynamism.

00:30:17.440 --> 00:30:18.480
Why would he do that?

00:30:18.480 --> 00:30:19.890
I don't know.

00:30:19.960 --> 00:30:20.850
But that's not important.

00:30:20.850 --> 00:30:21.780
What matters is,

00:30:22.410 --> 00:30:23.000
look,

00:30:23.000 --> 00:30:25.130
there's this new press release today.

00:30:30.010 --> 00:30:32.940
I practice architecture
to win awards and gain fame.

00:30:33.230 --> 00:30:35.010
Winning awards gives me more options

00:30:35.010 --> 00:30:36.540
to work on better projects.

00:30:39.810 --> 00:30:40.850
Think about it. This recording

00:30:40.850 --> 00:30:44.050
could only have been released
by the boss himself, right?

00:30:45.300 --> 00:30:46.650
So I'm confused.

00:30:46.940 --> 00:30:49.200
If the boss has the complete recording
all along,

00:30:49.200 --> 00:30:51.000
why wait until now to release it?

00:30:53.570 --> 00:30:54.680
Mr. Xiao actually

00:30:54.850 --> 00:30:57.450
put his best resources
where they matter most.

00:30:57.900 --> 00:30:58.830
What do you mean?

00:31:05.880 --> 00:31:07.160
[Didn't they say Dynamism is fighting
for Lyman Group's new project?]

00:31:09.370 --> 00:31:10.480
No wonder.

00:31:10.760 --> 00:31:11.760
After this recording came out,

00:31:11.760 --> 00:31:13.960
Lyman has restored
our competition qualification.

00:31:13.960 --> 00:31:15.850
Isn't this just free publicity?

00:31:16.440 --> 00:31:17.240
Not just that.

00:31:19.000 --> 00:31:20.280
Every step

00:31:20.650 --> 00:31:21.580
was calculated.

00:31:22.280 --> 00:31:22.850
What?

00:31:24.270 --> 00:31:24.860
Nothing.

00:31:25.650 --> 00:31:27.090
I even suspect

00:31:27.090 --> 00:31:28.330
that those posts by Jiang Tianyi

00:31:28.330 --> 00:31:29.990
were all arranged by Mr. Xiao.

00:31:31.930 --> 00:31:32.760
Hu Xiu,

00:31:33.440 --> 00:31:34.520
from now on,

00:31:36.240 --> 00:31:37.640
don't mess with Mr. Xiao.

00:31:47.300 --> 00:31:49.100
Their competition eligibility

00:31:50.410 --> 00:31:52.010
has actually been restored.

00:31:53.090 --> 00:31:53.680
Yes.

00:31:54.690 --> 00:31:56.620
Lyman just made the announcement.

00:31:58.290 --> 00:31:59.870
There's one more thing, Mr. Pei.

00:31:59.870 --> 00:32:02.330
Xiao Zhiyu's reputation has turned around.

00:32:02.610 --> 00:32:05.070
After the complete recording was released,

00:32:05.200 --> 00:32:06.930
everyone online is talking about it,

00:32:06.930 --> 00:32:08.720
and they're optimistic about
his participation in Lyman's competition.

00:32:08.720 --> 00:32:09.910
Sun Daqin

00:32:10.180 --> 00:32:11.620
repeatedly promised me

00:32:12.000 --> 00:32:14.330
that he wouldn't let him
meet with Xie Lin.

00:32:15.280 --> 00:32:16.960
It's only been one weekend.

00:32:19.090 --> 00:32:20.810
How did he get Xie Lin to agree?

00:32:23.520 --> 00:32:24.280
Speak up.

00:32:25.360 --> 00:32:26.490
It was my oversight.

00:32:26.770 --> 00:32:28.090
I heard from Sun Daqin

00:32:28.480 --> 00:32:31.200
that Xie Lin would attend a wedding
on the weekend,

00:32:31.200 --> 00:32:33.930
but I didn't expect Xiao Zhiyu
would be there too.

00:32:34.280 --> 00:32:36.890
He's quite good at turning things around
in desperate situations.

00:32:36.890 --> 00:32:37.680
However,

00:32:38.090 --> 00:32:38.810
Dynamism

00:32:38.810 --> 00:32:40.200
has been less than 5 years
since its founding.

00:32:40.200 --> 00:32:41.400
They lack experience

00:32:41.410 --> 00:32:44.030
and might not be able
to handle such a large project.

00:32:44.030 --> 00:32:45.310
It's not enough.

00:32:46.610 --> 00:32:47.680
What I want

00:32:48.570 --> 00:32:49.850
is Dynamism

00:32:50.570 --> 00:32:52.830
to have absolutely no chance of winning.

00:32:59.200 --> 00:32:59.930
Mr. Xiao.

00:33:05.570 --> 00:33:06.370
Um,

00:33:06.640 --> 00:33:09.300
here are the documents
you asked me to organize.

00:33:09.550 --> 00:33:10.950
Just put them on the desk.

00:33:17.170 --> 00:33:18.520
Um, Mr. Xiao.

00:33:19.570 --> 00:33:22.570
Was it you who called my friend yesterday?

00:33:23.380 --> 00:33:25.410
How did you get my friend's number?

00:33:26.320 --> 00:33:27.720
You go in and out every day

00:33:27.960 --> 00:33:30.220
and haven't noticed the sign at the door?

00:33:30.570 --> 00:33:32.170
It has contact numbers on it.

00:33:36.440 --> 00:33:39.370
Did you also buy that medicine?

00:33:42.330 --> 00:33:44.170
My friend wants to thank you
for the medicine you bought.

00:33:44.170 --> 00:33:45.130
When she came back,

00:33:45.130 --> 00:33:47.330
all the pharmacies nearby were closed.

00:33:47.760 --> 00:33:49.720
I just hope
your foot injury heals quickly,

00:33:49.720 --> 00:33:51.450
so you can get back to work soon.

00:33:56.850 --> 00:33:57.370
Hello.

00:33:57.680 --> 00:33:58.280
We're from Dynamism.

00:33:58.280 --> 00:33:59.680
We're here for a meeting.

00:33:59.890 --> 00:34:00.750
Please come in.

00:34:04.170 --> 00:34:04.760
Sun,

00:34:05.430 --> 00:34:07.030
did you bring the documents?

00:34:07.960 --> 00:34:08.600
The car key.

00:34:08.600 --> 00:34:10.060
I'll go get the documents.

00:34:22.370 --> 00:34:23.440
Jiang Tianyi.

00:34:24.139 --> 00:34:25.469
What are you doing here?

00:34:26.040 --> 00:34:27.040
None of your business.

00:34:27.040 --> 00:34:27.969
Get out of my way.

00:34:28.730 --> 00:34:29.980
Jiang Tianyi! Jiang Tianyi.

00:34:29.980 --> 00:34:30.710
Calm down.

00:34:31.159 --> 00:34:34.080
Whatever it is,
let's sit down and talk it through.

00:34:34.159 --> 00:34:35.850
Stop pretending to be nice to me.

00:34:35.850 --> 00:34:36.810
Look what's happened to me.

00:34:36.810 --> 00:34:38.170
I won't let them get away with this!

00:34:38.170 --> 00:34:39.570
Jiang Tianyi, calm down.

00:34:39.600 --> 00:34:40.560
Calm down.

00:34:40.560 --> 00:34:42.370
Nothing can't be overcome.

00:34:42.370 --> 00:34:43.030
Move aside.

00:34:43.250 --> 00:34:43.850
I won't.

00:34:43.850 --> 00:34:44.780
Get out of my way!

00:34:44.889 --> 00:34:45.440
Jiang Tianyi, I...

00:34:45.440 --> 00:34:46.040
Move!

00:34:46.040 --> 00:34:46.810
Jiang Tianyi!

00:34:46.810 --> 00:34:48.040
Let's talk this through, Jiang Tianyi!

00:34:48.040 --> 00:34:49.000
Get out of my way! Get out of my way!

00:34:49.000 --> 00:34:49.810
Jiang Tianyi!

00:34:49.810 --> 00:34:50.560
You!

00:35:09.770 --> 00:35:11.120
This is a public place,

00:35:11.260 --> 00:35:12.590
and you dare hit a woman?

00:35:12.810 --> 00:35:14.010
Take him to security.

00:35:14.270 --> 00:35:15.310
Move.

00:35:18.690 --> 00:35:19.440
Are you okay?

00:35:19.730 --> 00:35:20.440
Thank you.

00:35:23.200 --> 00:35:25.800
Could you press the first floor for me?
Thanks.

00:35:34.890 --> 00:35:36.210
It seems the security in this building

00:35:36.210 --> 00:35:37.370
needs improvement.

00:35:37.460 --> 00:35:38.480
Did he scare you?

00:35:38.770 --> 00:35:39.440
I'm fine.

00:35:41.540 --> 00:35:42.910
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

00:35:42.930 --> 00:35:44.530
It was really our oversight.

00:35:45.110 --> 00:35:45.660
It's okay.

00:35:45.660 --> 00:35:46.460
You can go now.

00:35:49.600 --> 00:35:50.800
Do you work for Lyman?

00:35:51.560 --> 00:35:52.210
No.

00:35:52.240 --> 00:35:52.640
I am

00:35:52.640 --> 00:35:53.120
an assistant designer

00:35:53.120 --> 00:35:54.210
from Dynamism.

00:35:54.450 --> 00:35:55.710
I'm here for a meeting.

00:35:57.810 --> 00:35:58.440
Perfect.

00:35:58.440 --> 00:35:59.900
I'm here for a meeting too.

00:35:59.930 --> 00:36:01.130
Let's go up together.

00:36:02.480 --> 00:36:03.160
Thank you.

00:36:18.330 --> 00:36:19.890
They are currently
the strongest competitors

00:36:19.890 --> 00:36:21.160
for our project.

00:36:22.690 --> 00:36:24.210
I've called you all here today

00:36:24.210 --> 00:36:26.210
mainly to discuss further

00:36:26.210 --> 00:36:29.250
some requirements
for the later stages of this project.

00:36:29.250 --> 00:36:30.960
Feel free to ask any questions.

00:36:30.960 --> 00:36:31.560
Mr. Xie.

00:36:38.440 --> 00:36:39.040
Mr. Xiao.

00:36:45.080 --> 00:36:47.480
Keeping people waiting isn't a good habit.

00:36:49.870 --> 00:36:51.600
I'll be more careful next time.

00:36:52.120 --> 00:36:52.650
Let's go.

00:36:56.810 --> 00:36:57.410
No rush.

00:37:04.780 --> 00:37:05.930
Sorry, I'm late.

00:37:06.560 --> 00:37:07.210
Uncle Xie,

00:37:07.330 --> 00:37:08.080
sorry to keep you waiting.

00:37:08.080 --> 00:37:09.810
It's fine. We just got here too.

00:37:09.910 --> 00:37:11.110
Introduce yourself.

00:37:11.250 --> 00:37:12.370
I'm Pei Zhen from Zhuling. Hello.

00:37:12.370 --> 00:37:12.890
Hello.

00:37:13.120 --> 00:37:13.640
Hello.

00:37:16.610 --> 00:37:18.740
Why were you with Mr. Pei from Zhuling?

00:37:20.560 --> 00:37:21.210
Mr. Pei?

00:37:22.750 --> 00:37:23.950
The one with glasses?

00:37:25.850 --> 00:37:26.730
I don't know.

00:37:26.730 --> 00:37:28.190
I just met him downstairs.

00:37:29.410 --> 00:37:31.480
I just realized he's from Zhuling.

00:37:31.730 --> 00:37:32.960
From Zhuling?

00:37:33.310 --> 00:37:34.830
He's the heir to Zhuling.

00:37:38.490 --> 00:37:39.480
You guys go ahead first.

00:37:39.480 --> 00:37:40.540
I'll be right back.

00:37:40.550 --> 00:37:43.700
[Lyman Group]

00:37:43.700 --> 00:37:46.100
Mr. Xiao,
hope we can learn from each other.

00:37:46.480 --> 00:37:47.640
Likewise.

00:37:48.370 --> 00:37:49.810
Mr. Xiao, you're so talented.

00:37:49.810 --> 00:37:51.040
I'm honored

00:37:51.160 --> 00:37:52.290
to meet you again.

00:38:13.120 --> 00:38:14.160
Since everyone is here,

00:38:14.160 --> 00:38:15.040
let's begin.

00:38:28.080 --> 00:38:29.850
Let's start with Zheng,

00:38:29.850 --> 00:38:31.850
who will brief you on the situation.

00:38:37.250 --> 00:38:39.330
As emphasized in the presentation,

00:38:39.960 --> 00:38:42.440
our 3 principles for the design plan

00:38:42.690 --> 00:38:43.730
are human-centered,

00:38:43.730 --> 00:38:44.640
sustainable,

00:38:44.930 --> 00:38:45.730
and feasible.

00:38:46.730 --> 00:38:47.990
What we're looking for

00:38:48.040 --> 00:38:49.480
is not just a design plan,

00:38:49.890 --> 00:38:52.810
but a spatial solution
that can carry the city's memories

00:38:52.810 --> 00:38:55.480
and meet the needs of future living.

00:38:55.890 --> 00:38:56.490
Thank you.

00:38:59.020 --> 00:39:00.150
Alright, everyone.

00:39:00.600 --> 00:39:02.200
That's the basic situation.

00:39:02.480 --> 00:39:03.410
I look forward to

00:39:03.960 --> 00:39:05.250
all of you designers

00:39:05.560 --> 00:39:07.000
using your creativity

00:39:07.210 --> 00:39:08.740
to inject into this project

00:39:09.120 --> 00:39:10.730
a brilliant soul.

00:39:15.690 --> 00:39:16.770
Today's meeting

00:39:16.770 --> 00:39:17.690
is over.

00:39:18.210 --> 00:39:19.190
Thank you all for your hard work.

00:39:19.190 --> 00:39:20.320
Meeting adjourned.

00:39:24.560 --> 00:39:25.490
Wait, everyone.

00:39:26.730 --> 00:39:28.190
I need you to fill this out.

00:39:34.690 --> 00:39:35.480
Ms. Hu,

00:39:36.000 --> 00:39:37.000
see you next time.

00:39:44.410 --> 00:39:45.410
When I came back,

00:39:45.410 --> 00:39:46.850
I ran into Jiang Tianyi.

00:39:46.850 --> 00:39:48.370
He tried to force his way in
and cause trouble.

00:39:48.370 --> 00:39:49.410
I couldn't stop him.

00:39:49.410 --> 00:39:51.210
Thankfully, Mr. Pei helped out.

00:40:26.000 --> 00:40:27.210
If you want a meeting,

00:40:27.400 --> 00:40:28.900
just make an appointment
with my assistant.

00:40:28.900 --> 00:40:30.080
It's inappropriate

00:40:30.080 --> 00:40:31.480
to show up here suddenly.

00:40:33.230 --> 00:40:34.730
I don't like those

00:40:35.160 --> 00:40:36.560
who think they are smart.

00:40:38.250 --> 00:40:38.810
Mr. Pei.

00:40:43.040 --> 00:40:43.600
Mr. Pei.

00:40:43.900 --> 00:40:45.700
You didn't reply to my messages.

00:40:45.810 --> 00:40:46.890
I could only go to Zhuling to find you,

00:40:46.890 --> 00:40:48.330
but they didn't let me in.

00:40:49.640 --> 00:40:51.370
I had no choice.

00:40:51.870 --> 00:40:53.640
I've done what you asked me to do.

00:40:53.640 --> 00:40:54.810
We had a deal.

00:40:55.120 --> 00:40:57.330
You promised me
the position of Zhuling's design director.

00:40:57.330 --> 00:40:58.880
You were not helping me.

00:41:00.310 --> 00:41:02.250
It's you who don't accept Xiao Zhiyu.

00:41:02.250 --> 00:41:03.910
You wanted to vent your anger.

00:41:04.280 --> 00:41:05.880
I just took the opportunity.

00:41:06.330 --> 00:41:06.850
I...

00:41:07.690 --> 00:41:09.330
After the recording was exposed,

00:41:09.330 --> 00:41:10.730
you resigned very soon.

00:41:11.810 --> 00:41:12.810
Isn't that right?

00:41:13.890 --> 00:41:14.640
Yes.

00:41:15.120 --> 00:41:16.520
I was a little impatient.

00:41:17.450 --> 00:41:19.290
Should I wait for them to catch me,
Mr. Pei?

00:41:19.290 --> 00:41:20.890
I don't ask for anything else.

00:41:20.890 --> 00:41:21.810
All I ask is to let me

00:41:21.810 --> 00:41:23.560
be a regular staff member at Zhuling.

00:41:23.560 --> 00:41:25.760
This decision is a piece of cake for you.

00:41:27.250 --> 00:41:28.480
How will others think of me

00:41:28.480 --> 00:41:29.600
if I let you join Zhuling?

00:41:29.600 --> 00:41:30.600
I don't care!

00:41:30.730 --> 00:41:31.890
If I have no choice,

00:41:32.040 --> 00:41:33.700
I can't control what I'll say!

00:41:46.890 --> 00:41:47.730
Mr. Pei,

00:41:48.810 --> 00:41:50.210
I only want one way out.

00:41:51.040 --> 00:41:52.640
I beg you.

00:41:53.270 --> 00:41:55.080
I'm already on the blacklist
of the industry,

00:41:55.080 --> 00:41:55.890
and my reputation is ruined.

00:41:55.890 --> 00:41:57.440
I can't find a job at all.

00:41:58.810 --> 00:41:59.640
Or...

00:42:00.450 --> 00:42:01.210
Or should I

00:42:01.210 --> 00:42:02.850
change my name, Mr. Pei?

00:42:11.040 --> 00:42:12.410
Change your name?

00:42:13.770 --> 00:42:15.250
It's really pathetic.

00:42:17.390 --> 00:42:18.810
Your brother has changed his name.

00:42:18.810 --> 00:42:20.120
He took after the auntie's surname,

00:42:20.120 --> 00:42:21.180
called Xiao Zhiyu.

00:42:22.000 --> 00:42:23.480
From now on,

00:42:23.620 --> 00:42:25.540
you can't call him by his original name.
