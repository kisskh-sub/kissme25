WEBVTT

00:01:56.450 --> 00:01:58.452
Mother, you can just keep working.

00:01:59.161 --> 00:02:01.997
I'll just stay here quietly and leave.

00:02:02.623 --> 00:02:03.541
Aren't you busy at work?

00:02:03.624 --> 00:02:06.126
I am. I'm going to Paris
the day after tomorrow.

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:08.754
You'll have to pack your stuff.

00:02:10.381 --> 00:02:12.049
Are you telling me to leave? Now?

00:02:12.132 --> 00:02:13.300
No.

00:02:14.885 --> 00:02:16.011
That's not what I meant.

00:02:16.095 --> 00:02:21.058
I mean... But it's okay
to visit a friend's place.

00:02:21.141 --> 00:02:22.142
Of course.

00:02:22.226 --> 00:02:23.602
- Why wouldn't it be?
- You're the best.

00:02:29.108 --> 00:02:32.027
If I can't even come here,
I'll suffocate to death.

00:02:34.363 --> 00:02:36.532
This is messed up.

00:02:36.615 --> 00:02:39.285
People just don't leave you alone.

00:02:46.876 --> 00:02:47.877
Did you eat?

00:02:49.420 --> 00:02:50.254
Want me to order in?

00:02:50.337 --> 00:02:53.507
I'm suddenly feeling hungry.
I'm craving tangsuyuk.

00:02:53.591 --> 00:02:56.260
What stops me from getting you
palbochae and yangjangpi?

00:02:56.927 --> 00:02:57.845
Hon…

00:02:57.928 --> 00:02:59.930
One large tangsuyuk, please.

00:03:00.014 --> 00:03:04.143
It's Somang Laundromat.
Yangjangpi and palbochae too.

00:03:05.060 --> 00:03:05.936
Do you want jjamppong?

00:03:06.020 --> 00:03:07.271
I love it.

00:03:07.855 --> 00:03:10.482
Two jjamppong. Hurry up, please.

00:03:13.819 --> 00:03:14.987
Ji-woo.

00:03:15.070 --> 00:03:16.405
Yes.

00:03:19.533 --> 00:03:20.951
I learned only now.

00:03:22.369 --> 00:03:23.913
It's all thanks to you.

00:03:28.834 --> 00:03:33.172
Thank you.
I'm sure it wasn't easy to do that.

00:03:34.173 --> 00:03:35.549
I really appreciate it.

00:03:47.227 --> 00:03:48.312
I'll come again.

00:03:51.106 --> 00:03:53.359
When I come back, get me creamy shrimp.

00:03:54.068 --> 00:03:56.236
Sure, let's do that.

00:04:02.660 --> 00:04:04.453
CORRECTIONAL CENTER

00:04:05.412 --> 00:04:06.914
Like you said,

00:04:06.997 --> 00:04:09.750
when I mentioned Didroxin,
Kang Min-woo came right away.

00:04:12.002 --> 00:04:14.588
Dr. Kim at Bright Plastic Surgery...

00:04:16.215 --> 00:04:17.800
The doctor who got me the drug.

00:04:18.926 --> 00:04:23.222
I heard him talking to Kang Min-woo
on the phone.

00:04:23.806 --> 00:04:24.890
JARIM KANG MIN-WOO

00:04:28.185 --> 00:04:32.856
Min-woo, I heard you introduced him
to a lot of clinics.

00:04:32.940 --> 00:04:35.943
Why are you asking him for drugs?
You should've told me.

00:04:36.443 --> 00:04:37.653
What?

00:04:37.736 --> 00:04:41.156
You're scaring me… Yes.

00:04:42.866 --> 00:04:43.867
Okay, bye.

00:04:47.955 --> 00:04:50.082
This fucker.

00:04:50.165 --> 00:04:51.125
Why?

00:04:52.626 --> 00:04:54.128
Kang Min-woo, that asshole.

00:04:54.211 --> 00:04:58.257
I've been polite as he's my school senior,
and now he thinks I'm a doormat.

00:04:58.340 --> 00:05:00.843
Kang Min-woo? Jin-eon's brother-in-law?

00:05:00.926 --> 00:05:02.469
Gosh, he ruined the mood for drinking.

00:05:03.053 --> 00:05:05.472
Why are you intimidated by him?

00:05:05.556 --> 00:05:06.932
Do you owe him money?

00:05:07.016 --> 00:05:08.225
You think it's funny?

00:05:10.686 --> 00:05:14.273
You and Jin-eon should be careful.
This asshole seems to know something.

00:05:16.483 --> 00:05:20.863
And what kind of drug is he after
that he's with a pharmaceutical salesman?

00:05:22.031 --> 00:05:23.032
That's why.

00:05:24.950 --> 00:05:28.662
I assumed the one who reported me
would be Kang Min-woo.

00:05:29.830 --> 00:05:31.749
Do you know the salesman's name?

00:05:34.084 --> 00:05:37.588
Why are you digging into Kang Min-woo?

00:05:37.671 --> 00:05:38.881
I've read your articles.

00:05:39.673 --> 00:05:41.050
Are you helping Seo Ji-woo?

00:05:42.926 --> 00:05:43.927
Yes.

00:05:46.597 --> 00:05:49.058
I bet Seo Ji-woo feels so supported.

00:05:49.141 --> 00:05:53.187
If my suspicions are correct,
Kang Min-woo is committing a crime.

00:05:54.563 --> 00:05:56.523
I'm not just helping Ji-woo.

00:05:58.192 --> 00:06:00.527
I need evidence
for an investigation to begin.

00:06:03.405 --> 00:06:05.032
That asshole said

00:06:05.574 --> 00:06:10.746
I was a stupid bitch who did drugs
with a married man. Well, it's true,

00:06:10.829 --> 00:06:13.957
but to hear that coming from him,
it pissed me off.

00:06:14.833 --> 00:06:16.627
So I need to see that dick…

00:06:17.503 --> 00:06:18.754
go down.

00:06:20.881 --> 00:06:24.718
That salesman's name was Gu-han.
I don't know his last name.

00:06:24.802 --> 00:06:27.888
And I'm not sure
if his company sells Didroxin.

00:06:28.430 --> 00:06:29.765
I heard

00:06:29.848 --> 00:06:33.644
Kang Min-woo got the drug
from a salesman named Gu-han.

00:06:35.854 --> 00:06:37.606
That's all I know.

00:06:39.316 --> 00:06:40.818
No one's getting me out.

00:06:44.613 --> 00:06:45.989
Reporter Lee,

00:06:46.990 --> 00:06:49.159
you need to smash
that Kang Min-woo bastard.

00:06:50.035 --> 00:06:51.203
In here,

00:06:51.995 --> 00:06:53.831
I'm getting no dopamine.

00:06:58.252 --> 00:06:59.628
The Wind of April.

00:07:01.088 --> 00:07:02.548
I like that movie.

00:07:04.424 --> 00:07:07.219
When you were sweeping
international awards with that movie,

00:07:08.720 --> 00:07:10.013
I was proud of you.

00:07:12.558 --> 00:07:13.892
Thank you for your help.

00:07:30.617 --> 00:07:34.204
All right, what we have to focus on
is Kang Min-woo's evil deeds.

00:07:34.288 --> 00:07:36.582
Then what do we have to prove first?

00:07:39.960 --> 00:07:41.628
It's time for our teamwork to shine.

00:07:41.712 --> 00:07:43.672
This is serious.

00:07:43.755 --> 00:07:46.258
I see his eyes have gone crazy.

00:07:46.341 --> 00:07:47.676
You do? It motivates you, right?

00:07:47.759 --> 00:07:49.136
What am I doing here?

00:07:49.219 --> 00:07:50.095
Are you out?

00:07:50.179 --> 00:07:52.347
No, I'm asking
what the Economics Team can do.

00:07:52.848 --> 00:07:54.808
Once our article is ready,
you need to support it.

00:07:54.892 --> 00:07:57.644
- With what?
- Lucas is coming to JARIM.

00:07:57.728 --> 00:08:01.023
Focus on the value and symbolism
of an international luxury brand.

00:08:01.106 --> 00:08:04.151
That JARIM Apparel will upgrade
Korea's fashion business.

00:08:04.693 --> 00:08:06.570
You're good at it. It's your thing.

00:08:07.905 --> 00:08:11.116
You're telling me to write
that Seo Ji-woo's done a great job.

00:08:11.200 --> 00:08:13.118
So? You can't?

00:08:13.202 --> 00:08:15.913
Jeez.
I'm a total pro with things like that.

00:08:17.456 --> 00:08:19.875
That means
you have nothing to do right now.

00:08:19.958 --> 00:08:21.210
Yeah. Wait, what?

00:08:22.002 --> 00:08:23.795
Come dig into the clinics with me.

00:08:25.631 --> 00:08:26.715
Is it too much by yourself?

00:08:26.798 --> 00:08:29.092
There are places I can't get through
due to my youthful face.

00:08:31.094 --> 00:08:33.263
Right. You'll have to go with her.

00:08:33.347 --> 00:08:37.893
How come everyone in this team is…
What's your hiring criteria, Kyeong-do?

00:08:37.976 --> 00:08:40.646
Different from you. Because I'm an ace.

00:08:40.729 --> 00:08:43.482
- All right. Let's go.
- Okay.

00:09:25.399 --> 00:09:27.025
{\an8}My Ji-woo,

00:09:27.109 --> 00:09:29.945
make a luxury clothing like this one.

00:09:30.862 --> 00:09:35.200
Make a brand that can be passed down
from a mother to her daughter,

00:09:36.118 --> 00:09:39.454
and a father to his son.

00:09:40.706 --> 00:09:44.543
When you said you had never been okay,

00:09:46.044 --> 00:09:47.713
it broke my heart.

00:09:49.131 --> 00:09:50.382
I am sorry

00:09:51.591 --> 00:09:55.429
for all those years.

00:10:29.963 --> 00:10:31.256
LEE GU-HAN

00:10:31.340 --> 00:10:35.719
Lee Gu-han signed with five big clinics
so he became a team manager right away.

00:10:41.516 --> 00:10:43.518
{\an8}We need the client list
of Ryuwoong Pharmaceuticals.

00:10:44.686 --> 00:10:47.481
I'll see if they have any connection
with Kang Min-woo.

00:10:48.023 --> 00:10:51.068
Yeah, I'm on the skin care clinic street
you mentioned.

00:10:52.486 --> 00:10:53.987
But there are so many.

00:10:57.657 --> 00:11:00.911
I found the building you mentioned.
Let me check and call you back.

00:11:00.994 --> 00:11:02.245
PIURI FACE CLINIC

00:11:05.290 --> 00:11:06.750
DR. LEE SANG-UK

00:11:11.713 --> 00:11:13.048
DIDROXIN CLINICAL USAGE

00:11:20.889 --> 00:11:22.224
Thank you, bye.

00:11:22.307 --> 00:11:24.518
Sung-cheol, An Da-hye's testimony is here.

00:11:24.601 --> 00:11:26.770
- Didroxin and all from the start?
- Yeah.

00:11:29.398 --> 00:11:31.691
Bo-ra, can you check this?

00:11:32.317 --> 00:11:33.318
Yes.

00:11:34.319 --> 00:11:35.153
Okay.

00:11:35.237 --> 00:11:36.530
Can you take a look at this?

00:11:36.613 --> 00:11:39.366
What's the name of the tennis club?

00:11:42.202 --> 00:11:45.122
KANG MIN-WOO'S SELLOUT SCENARIO - VER 2

00:11:45.205 --> 00:11:47.290
[EXCLUSIVE] JARIM'S SELLOUT PLAN…
BY KANG MIN-WOO

00:11:56.842 --> 00:11:57.926
You're still here?

00:11:58.760 --> 00:12:01.263
I'm about to leave. But listen.

00:12:02.389 --> 00:12:04.641
Why don't we add a few video screenshots?

00:12:04.724 --> 00:12:05.725
What video?

00:12:06.268 --> 00:12:09.104
I looked it up.
You know, when you went to JARIM.

00:12:09.187 --> 00:12:12.691
When CEO Seo was showing symptoms,
someone filmed it.

00:12:13.233 --> 00:12:15.735
With this, his evil deed
would stand out even more.

00:12:20.449 --> 00:12:22.576
Wouldn't that make CEO Seo uncomfortable?

00:12:24.161 --> 00:12:26.163
He did such a thing
to a completely normal person,

00:12:26.788 --> 00:12:28.623
It'll deliver more effectively.

00:12:30.459 --> 00:12:32.377
You are a real TJ.

00:12:33.336 --> 00:12:35.589
- Should I send you the video?
- Sure.

00:12:39.050 --> 00:12:41.636
A coffee at this hour
might upset your stomach.

00:12:43.472 --> 00:12:46.183
Have this instead.
I've been having this like you.

00:12:46.266 --> 00:12:48.685
When I need to focus, it wakes me up.

00:12:57.110 --> 00:12:58.153
I feel refreshed already.

00:12:59.905 --> 00:13:00.780
Here.

00:13:05.202 --> 00:13:07.621
Delicious. I'll send you the video.

00:13:08.413 --> 00:13:09.456
Good luck.

00:13:13.043 --> 00:13:14.753
She's an F when she does that.

00:13:50.330 --> 00:13:52.165
LAST EPISODE

00:13:58.046 --> 00:14:01.716
You should go straight home.
It was a long flight.

00:14:01.800 --> 00:14:04.219
Where do you live?
Should we drop him off first?

00:14:04.302 --> 00:14:05.262
Yes.

00:14:05.345 --> 00:14:09.224
No. It's okay. I'll go home
after reporting to the team manager.

00:14:11.393 --> 00:14:13.562
Look. I got a text from the team manager.

00:14:17.190 --> 00:14:18.233
Director.

00:14:21.111 --> 00:14:26.408
[EXCLUSIVE] JARIM'S SECRET SELLOUT PLAN…
BY CEO SEO JI-YEON'S HUSBAND KANG MIN-WOO

00:14:30.537 --> 00:14:32.914

ILLEGAL DISTRIBUTION OF DIDROXIN

00:15:02.861 --> 00:15:07.282
DID KANG MIN-WOO NEED JARIM CEO
TO BE ILL TO SELL THE COMPANY?

00:15:10.994 --> 00:15:12.162
Mr. Bae Jun-soo.

00:15:18.501 --> 00:15:20.128
It's time for you to step up now.

00:15:20.712 --> 00:15:22.922
Choose between an accomplice and a victim.

00:15:26.259 --> 00:15:29.679
If I choose to be a victim,
do I need to give you anything?

00:15:29.763 --> 00:15:31.765
The texts you had with Kang Min-woo.

00:15:34.809 --> 00:15:37.729
"Didn't know about her condition
until the article."

00:15:37.812 --> 00:15:40.357
"Thought the company sales
had already been agreed."

00:15:41.191 --> 00:15:46.488
One more. "One of the conditions was
to keep it unofficial and low profile."

00:15:46.571 --> 00:15:50.950
And don't mention the 30 billion won
that Kang Min-woo blew up.

00:16:07.592 --> 00:16:11.012
All right. As of now, we begin
the search and seizure. Let's hurry up.

00:16:11.096 --> 00:16:11.930
Yes, sir.

00:16:12.013 --> 00:16:12.847
{\an8}KANG MIN-WOO

00:16:12.931 --> 00:16:14.683
{\an8}Check under the desks and chairs.

00:16:16.184 --> 00:16:19.062
The prosecutor seized and searched
Kang Min-woo's office.

00:16:19.145 --> 00:16:23.775
The whereabouts of Yoo, who prepared
CEO Seo Ji-yeon drink, are unknown.

00:16:23.858 --> 00:16:26.194
The police
are currently searching for her.

00:16:32.826 --> 00:16:34.119
Choose.

00:16:35.578 --> 00:16:37.580
Either get in this car
and go to the police

00:16:37.664 --> 00:16:40.458
to confess everything to be on probation

00:16:41.626 --> 00:16:45.213
or continue running away
and get caught and be imprisoned.

00:16:52.429 --> 00:16:54.055
You i be sleeping in peace.

00:16:55.223 --> 00:16:58.727
You finally got your revenge,
and JARIM's on a roll.

00:16:59.686 --> 00:17:00.687
Your wish came true.

00:17:04.232 --> 00:17:08.319
I hope Ro-a doesn't know any of this.

00:17:08.403 --> 00:17:10.447
That's why I waited.

00:17:11.656 --> 00:17:14.033
If you were a human being,
I thought you'd stop.

00:17:15.285 --> 00:17:16.828
I waited.

00:17:17.412 --> 00:17:21.166
How can I sleep at night
when I have a child?

00:17:39.267 --> 00:17:40.602
There.

00:17:52.697 --> 00:17:55.450
What on earth does he eat? My goodness.

00:17:57.660 --> 00:17:58.661
Goodness.

00:18:59.722 --> 00:19:03.935
Working in a company
is not an easy thing to do.

00:19:05.395 --> 00:19:09.315
The work just never ends.

00:19:10.483 --> 00:19:13.069
And why is the lunch hour so short?

00:19:13.987 --> 00:19:16.281
I drink so much coffee
that my stomach hurts.

00:19:18.825 --> 00:19:22.370
Should I get some misutgaru?
This is delicious, Mother.

00:19:22.453 --> 00:19:24.539
But I should add less sugar.

00:19:24.622 --> 00:19:27.667
Nowadays,
sugar-free, zero-sugar is the trend.

00:19:27.750 --> 00:19:28.585
Right, Father?

00:19:30.295 --> 00:19:32.171
Well, it's up to you.

00:19:34.215 --> 00:19:37.093
Now, Lucas is here…

00:19:37.844 --> 00:19:42.682
I told you about him before, right?
The famous designer, Lucas?

00:19:42.765 --> 00:19:45.435
- Yes.
- The one from Spain.

00:19:45.518 --> 00:19:46.936
Yes. Right.

00:19:47.020 --> 00:19:51.649
I need to see if the designers
are settling down all right.

00:19:52.191 --> 00:19:54.611
Because this is their first time
living in Korea,

00:19:54.694 --> 00:19:58.239
I have to check everything
from what they eat to where they sleep…

00:20:05.663 --> 00:20:07.749
What is Kyeong-do up to these days?

00:20:11.628 --> 00:20:15.340
I don't know either. He's barely home.

00:20:32.941 --> 00:20:34.442
He must be working overtime a lot.

00:20:35.193 --> 00:20:37.987
But does an assistant manager
have to work overtime?

00:20:42.867 --> 00:20:44.994
Do you think
he's taking vitamins at least?

00:20:48.581 --> 00:20:51.834
Hello. Hi.

00:20:55.088 --> 00:20:56.547
First… Department Manager Jin.

00:20:56.631 --> 00:20:57.799
- This is for you.
- Thank you.

00:21:00.176 --> 00:21:03.346
Dongwoon Daily and I have very close ties.

00:21:04.138 --> 00:21:08.393
I happened to be in the area,
and I'd be too heartless to just pass by.

00:21:08.476 --> 00:21:10.520
This is for you
to recharge vitamins and caffeine.

00:21:11.562 --> 00:21:13.898
I thought you had to order these
in advance.

00:21:15.149 --> 00:21:18.194
This is organic.

00:21:18.277 --> 00:21:20.571
It includes no pesticides,
so you don't need to worry.

00:21:21.239 --> 00:21:24.450
We appreciate you coming here
when you're busy…

00:21:24.534 --> 00:21:27.829
Oh, sure, I'm busy. I have piles of work,

00:21:27.912 --> 00:21:32.000
but I just happened to be in the area.
This is nothing for me.

00:21:32.083 --> 00:21:33.960
Should I bring some sandwiches next time?

00:21:34.043 --> 00:21:36.879
Wait, you need to say hi
to the Economics Team too.

00:21:36.963 --> 00:21:39.632
I put in a lot of effort

00:21:39.716 --> 00:21:42.552
into the supporting article.
I'm really disappointed.

00:21:43.720 --> 00:21:47.724
I'm always like this.
Next time, I'll get one for everyone

00:21:47.807 --> 00:21:50.727
from here all the way down the hall.

00:21:51.853 --> 00:21:53.354
No need.

00:21:53.438 --> 00:21:56.190
We're not as close as you think.
We only share the office.

00:21:58.234 --> 00:21:59.861
We have mouths too,
Department Manager Jin.

00:22:05.199 --> 00:22:06.826
By the way…

00:22:06.909 --> 00:22:09.412
Assistant Manager is out to gather news.

00:22:11.372 --> 00:22:15.251
I guess the assistant manager
is busier nowadays.

00:22:16.127 --> 00:22:18.463
We're busy too.

00:22:19.255 --> 00:22:20.757
You're busy…

00:22:20.840 --> 00:22:23.468
- Who says we're busy? We're not. Never.
- Some coffee…

00:22:23.551 --> 00:22:25.136
- Yeah.
- Han-kyeong, I want coffee.

00:22:40.318 --> 00:22:44.238
Jeong-min's getting spicy braised chicken
from a famous spot. Want to join?

00:22:45.281 --> 00:22:46.240
I'll make time.

00:22:46.324 --> 00:22:48.451
SE-YEONG

00:22:56.751 --> 00:22:59.629
Good boy.
Did you call Kyeong-do, Jeong-min?

00:22:59.712 --> 00:23:01.964
I did. He's having a team dinner tonight.

00:23:02.048 --> 00:23:03.758
What, you…

00:23:03.841 --> 00:23:05.259
Why would you tell us now?

00:23:05.343 --> 00:23:07.512
Since when did we need Kyeong-do
to gather?

00:23:07.595 --> 00:23:08.930
That's not what I mean.

00:23:09.013 --> 00:23:12.642
It tastes even better. But even if
he can't make it, we're still Chaos.

00:23:12.725 --> 00:23:15.144
What are you talking about?
That's not what I mean.

00:23:16.604 --> 00:23:17.855
You see…

00:23:19.232 --> 00:23:24.695
I don't think we should spatter our saliva
in front of the chicken made by a master.

00:23:24.779 --> 00:23:25.822
You're right.

00:23:27.907 --> 00:23:30.618
I should've known better. Let's eat.

00:23:30.701 --> 00:23:32.829
Okay, let's eat.

00:23:32.912 --> 00:23:33.746
Enjoy.

00:23:33.830 --> 00:23:36.332
How come you only understand
what Ji-woo says?

00:23:36.415 --> 00:23:38.292
Dong-won, is it too spicy?

00:23:38.376 --> 00:23:40.253
- Do you want me to rinse it?
- No.

00:23:40.336 --> 00:23:41.712
- Hey.
- Dong-won,

00:23:41.796 --> 00:23:45.550
you can eat spicy food, and you're here
even when Uncle Kyeong-do is not.

00:23:45.633 --> 00:23:47.677
- You'll grow to be a good man.
- Yes!

00:23:49.554 --> 00:23:50.805
All right.

00:23:50.888 --> 00:23:52.557
Shut up and eat.

00:23:52.640 --> 00:23:54.267
Just shut up and eat.

00:23:54.350 --> 00:23:56.769
You're eating a lot.

00:23:56.894 --> 00:23:58.771
Have the drumstick and go chirp chirp.

00:24:01.482 --> 00:24:03.359
- Be careful. Okay?
- Yeah, bye.

00:24:03.442 --> 00:24:06.529
- Bye. Look forward. The stairs.
- Bye.

00:24:06.612 --> 00:24:08.447
- Get inside.
- Okay.

00:24:08.531 --> 00:24:11.200
- Drive safe. Yeah. Bye.
- Bye!

00:24:52.116 --> 00:24:53.910
I sent money to your account.

00:24:55.411 --> 00:24:56.245
Money?

00:24:56.329 --> 00:24:57.413
I've sent quite a lot.

00:24:58.456 --> 00:25:00.708
It'll be enough for you
to live somewhere for a year.

00:25:00.791 --> 00:25:02.376
Where would I go?

00:25:02.460 --> 00:25:06.881
You were going to a university in Chicago,
then you couldn't. Go there.

00:25:07.548 --> 00:25:10.259
It would've been nice
that the company covers the cost,

00:25:10.343 --> 00:25:12.136
but it'd be meaningful if we send you too.

00:25:16.015 --> 00:25:18.351
What? That's so out of the blue.

00:25:19.685 --> 00:25:22.813
You kill time at work
when you have nothing to do.

00:25:22.897 --> 00:25:25.024
Even when you're home, you don't eat well.

00:25:25.566 --> 00:25:27.860
Do you call that a life?

00:25:27.944 --> 00:25:29.028
I can take care of myself.

00:25:29.111 --> 00:25:31.113
You didn't get any rest.

00:25:31.197 --> 00:25:35.034
You took care of me, and helped us here
when we opened the laundromat.

00:25:35.952 --> 00:25:38.079
And just when it was getting better…

00:25:38.996 --> 00:25:40.581
We're giving you a vacation.

00:25:40.665 --> 00:25:46.170
Take a year off,
and go somewhere nice you want to go.

00:25:46.254 --> 00:25:49.548
Either study or just have fun.
Get some rest.

00:25:59.934 --> 00:26:02.019
I'll think about it.

00:26:03.688 --> 00:26:07.066
Besides, I have money. Why are you
giving me your hard-earned money?

00:26:07.149 --> 00:26:08.526
Take it.

00:26:09.277 --> 00:26:10.987
We're making money for you anyway.

00:26:14.782 --> 00:26:15.783
Kyeong-do.

00:26:19.370 --> 00:26:20.830
Are you able to carry on?

00:26:23.624 --> 00:26:28.587
There are still videos
gossiping about you two.

00:26:29.380 --> 00:26:32.466
You two aren't meeting
because you're scared of it.

00:26:33.467 --> 00:26:35.886
Not being able to see each other
when you two are so close…

00:26:37.555 --> 00:26:38.848
Are you okay with that?

00:26:41.767 --> 00:26:43.728
Let me sleep well tonight.

00:26:43.811 --> 00:26:47.773
Let me be your parent for once.

00:27:09.128 --> 00:27:11.547
- I won't have it then.
- No, please have it.

00:27:11.630 --> 00:27:13.466
Can't you read the room?

00:28:05.017 --> 00:28:07.478
I was scared when you said
you wanted to see me here.

00:28:07.561 --> 00:28:09.772
It's where you said
you wanted to quit before.

00:28:09.855 --> 00:28:11.357
I was young back then.

00:28:13.859 --> 00:28:16.654
Your mother and father are cool.

00:28:19.573 --> 00:28:20.658
I'll accept your leave.

00:28:21.617 --> 00:28:23.702
But promise me you'll return.

00:28:25.121 --> 00:28:26.122
Thank you.

00:28:26.205 --> 00:28:27.206
Jeez.

00:28:28.290 --> 00:28:30.209
This is why I don't get in a relationship.

00:28:32.002 --> 00:28:34.130
Even if it flops like mine,
it's still worth it.

00:28:34.213 --> 00:28:38.050
That's why you should've dated me,
you idiot.

00:28:38.134 --> 00:28:40.219
There you go again.

00:29:00.781 --> 00:29:03.701
Are you down for lunch?
I'll meet you near your company.

00:29:06.787 --> 00:29:08.289
What should I wear?

00:29:13.878 --> 00:29:15.546
I'm taking time off from work.

00:29:17.214 --> 00:29:18.924
Why? Are you sick?

00:29:20.634 --> 00:29:23.554
No, I just want to take a break.

00:29:31.312 --> 00:29:33.814
What are you going to do
with your time off?

00:29:35.441 --> 00:29:37.401
My mom and dad gave me money.

00:29:38.277 --> 00:29:41.155
They told me to go on vacation.
For about a year.

00:29:50.039 --> 00:29:51.248
Where are you going?

00:29:58.506 --> 00:30:00.966
I have a senior in Cuba.

00:30:02.259 --> 00:30:05.137
I'm thinking about going there first.

00:30:12.895 --> 00:30:14.063
That's far.

00:30:16.232 --> 00:30:17.233
Yeah.

00:30:20.152 --> 00:30:21.820
It's far.

00:30:28.869 --> 00:30:29.954
Do you need money?

00:30:30.704 --> 00:30:32.331
Aren't you short on budget?

00:30:52.017 --> 00:30:54.061
Promise to tell me when you leave.

00:30:55.312 --> 00:30:56.313
Promise…

00:30:58.566 --> 00:30:59.692
to tell me.

00:31:03.112 --> 00:31:04.113
Okay.

00:32:01.920 --> 00:32:04.757
{\an8}Seriously, don't they have
anything else to do?

00:32:04.840 --> 00:32:06.675
{\an8}JARIM APPAREL SEO JI-WOO
GIMBAP WITH A FRIEND

00:32:06.759 --> 00:32:08.802
Who can ever put up with that?

00:32:17.227 --> 00:32:18.646
You can sleep on the plane.

00:32:19.521 --> 00:32:20.522
Yes.

00:32:22.358 --> 00:32:25.903
I was going to take off with your luggage.
But you checked your bag fast.

00:32:28.113 --> 00:32:30.574
Exactly. In case you'd take revenge.

00:32:36.121 --> 00:32:37.581
Make sure to eat well.

00:32:38.499 --> 00:32:39.750
I'm worried about you.

00:32:41.877 --> 00:32:43.295
I didn't cry.

00:32:44.463 --> 00:32:47.341
I didn't when you said you were leaving.
I haven't cried since then.

00:32:51.887 --> 00:32:54.056
Don't worry about me and have a safe trip.

00:32:57.851 --> 00:32:58.852
Okay.

00:33:00.854 --> 00:33:01.855
Bye.

00:33:02.690 --> 00:33:04.483
Yeah. Bye.

00:33:09.113 --> 00:33:10.114
Go on.

00:33:32.970 --> 00:33:34.513
Bye. Go on.

00:35:00.599 --> 00:35:05.103
{\an8}1 YEAR LATER

00:35:05.187 --> 00:35:08.357
Bellinme S/S season is ready.

00:35:09.024 --> 00:35:10.526
Thanks to Designer Lucas,

00:35:10.609 --> 00:35:15.280
Bellinme will finally be on the gala show
runway early next year in Paris.

00:35:19.868 --> 00:35:25.082
And the menswear brand MANZAAR
is improving steadily.

00:35:25.165 --> 00:35:28.335
Like a child who almost ran away from home
has turned filial.

00:35:30.546 --> 00:35:33.048
Next is our new SPA brand to be launched.

00:35:33.131 --> 00:35:36.593
I'll have to fly to the head office
in Spain and check.

00:35:37.135 --> 00:35:41.014
I believe the fabric quality is crucial
for a low-middle-priced brand.

00:35:41.098 --> 00:35:43.642
Most people use dryers nowadays.

00:35:43.725 --> 00:35:46.478
It's important to make clothes
that don't get damaged,

00:35:46.562 --> 00:35:51.024
so we can start by choosing good fabric.

00:35:53.944 --> 00:35:54.945
Next…

00:35:58.073 --> 00:35:59.908
Lee Kyeong-do must have so much fun.

00:36:00.826 --> 00:36:03.704
Once you leave home, it's tough.
How can he be having fun?

00:36:05.998 --> 00:36:07.875
Where do you think he is now?

00:36:08.834 --> 00:36:11.753
Last time, was it Hokkaido?

00:36:11.837 --> 00:36:13.964
Up there in Japan.

00:36:15.299 --> 00:36:16.592
See?

00:36:16.675 --> 00:36:20.804
He's having fun traveling everywhere.
Mother, you shouldn't have let him go.

00:36:21.930 --> 00:36:25.976
It's okay for Kyeong-do to have some fun.
He grew up without puberty crisis.

00:36:28.228 --> 00:36:31.940
This is why it's always hard with in-laws.
They only pity their sons.

00:36:33.108 --> 00:36:35.402
What are you talking about?

00:36:36.737 --> 00:36:37.905
I wish we were in-laws.

00:36:38.864 --> 00:36:43.493
Mother, you and I are pretty much
experiencing an in-law fling.

00:36:44.453 --> 00:36:46.079
Right, Father?

00:36:47.164 --> 00:36:50.834
If you're that curious and annoyed,
call him yourself.

00:36:50.918 --> 00:36:52.002
Why are you asking me?

00:36:53.462 --> 00:36:54.630
What's wrong about asking you?

00:36:54.713 --> 00:36:56.590
Never stop complaining.

00:36:58.050 --> 00:37:01.261
You see, I'm being patient.

00:37:01.345 --> 00:37:04.222
I'd make an international call
a million times.

00:37:05.307 --> 00:37:09.269
But I'm holding back,
so I wouldn't ruin Kyeong-do's effort.

00:37:10.771 --> 00:37:12.105
What's he making an effort for?

00:37:16.276 --> 00:37:17.361
I don't know.

00:37:19.821 --> 00:37:22.699
You probably have a goal.

00:37:23.700 --> 00:37:27.204
To rest or to have fun.

00:37:27.287 --> 00:37:30.749
Or to study. Something like that.

00:37:39.633 --> 00:37:40.926
Whenever I see you…

00:37:46.974 --> 00:37:48.266
I just want to be happy.

00:37:53.188 --> 00:37:56.858
What's that supposed to mean?

00:38:00.070 --> 00:38:01.321
When I go home

00:38:02.656 --> 00:38:04.992
after seeing you like this…

00:38:08.954 --> 00:38:10.455
I hope to be able to say…

00:38:13.125 --> 00:38:14.209
"I'm just glad."

00:38:55.667 --> 00:38:56.960
Ta-da.

00:39:06.553 --> 00:39:07.554
What are you doing?

00:39:09.139 --> 00:39:10.557
My friend said I could try them on.

00:39:11.308 --> 00:39:12.726
What's the point of trying that on?

00:39:12.809 --> 00:39:13.810
It's a practice.

00:39:15.270 --> 00:39:17.898
Why? Are you going to marry another woman?

00:39:18.440 --> 00:39:19.274
What?

00:39:20.317 --> 00:39:23.111
No, but it's not like
we're getting married now.

00:39:23.195 --> 00:39:24.029
This is pretty.

00:39:32.079 --> 00:39:34.414
Ta-da.

00:39:37.918 --> 00:39:39.002
Let's take a picture.

00:39:40.087 --> 00:39:41.922
What? Okay.

00:39:43.632 --> 00:39:44.716
Hurry up.

00:39:46.551 --> 00:39:47.844
Why are you smiling like that?

00:39:47.928 --> 00:39:48.762
What?

00:39:50.806 --> 00:39:53.642
Let's try again. One, two, three.

00:39:55.268 --> 00:39:57.604
Ji-woo, you look so beautiful.

00:39:58.355 --> 00:39:59.189
Let me.

00:39:59.272 --> 00:40:00.732
Thanks. Thank you.

00:40:01.399 --> 00:40:03.193
Okay, smile.

00:40:03.819 --> 00:40:07.405
Ready. One, two, three.

00:40:07.489 --> 00:40:08.615
One more?

00:40:11.326 --> 00:40:12.577
Okay, smile.

00:40:12.661 --> 00:40:15.831
My phone showed this to me
as a souvenir of a few years back.

00:40:19.334 --> 00:40:20.335
Isn't it a good picture?

00:40:22.087 --> 00:40:25.340
Should I put it somewhere here?
Or should I print more?

00:40:25.924 --> 00:40:28.385
I'm this close
to take blood pressure meds.

00:40:28.468 --> 00:40:30.887
If you put it here,
my blood pressure will rise.

00:40:30.971 --> 00:40:33.348
It's proof that we had an in-laws fling.

00:40:33.431 --> 00:40:34.850
I know you like it.

00:40:43.441 --> 00:40:44.901
Whatever. I'm leaving that here.

00:40:47.612 --> 00:40:49.406
Father, I'll see you later.

00:40:49.489 --> 00:40:51.825
- You should stay for dinner.
- Should I?

00:40:51.908 --> 00:40:55.412
What are you talking about?
We just had lunch. She has work to do.

00:40:55.495 --> 00:40:57.831
I know you're happy to have me here.

00:40:58.999 --> 00:41:00.458
- Bye.
- Bye.

00:41:00.542 --> 00:41:01.376
I'll come again.

00:41:11.469 --> 00:41:15.140
Still, she wore the wedding dress
with Kyeong-do first.

00:41:16.641 --> 00:41:18.059
Show it to Kyeong-do.

00:41:18.143 --> 00:41:20.562
What for? It'd only disturb him.

00:41:25.942 --> 00:41:28.612
The show just ended.
Why are you working so hard?

00:41:28.695 --> 00:41:31.281
Hey, I have a good feeling
about this play.

00:41:31.364 --> 00:41:32.449
What about it?

00:41:32.532 --> 00:41:34.201
The lines are easy to memorize,

00:41:34.284 --> 00:41:36.661
and the movements are smooth.
How do I say it...

00:41:37.662 --> 00:41:38.872
Anyway, it's different.

00:41:39.456 --> 00:41:40.790
- Nice.
- It's nice.

00:41:40.874 --> 00:41:42.083
- It's nice.
- It is.

00:41:48.298 --> 00:41:49.883
Anyway, when is Kyeong-do coming back?

00:41:49.966 --> 00:41:50.842
It's been a year.

00:41:50.926 --> 00:41:52.510
Is he still wandering?

00:41:52.594 --> 00:41:54.179
Kyeong-do did the right thing.

00:41:54.262 --> 00:41:56.348
They shouldn't be
on the same latitude and longitude.

00:41:56.431 --> 00:41:59.559
As if that could help him get over her,
seriously. Jeez.

00:42:01.019 --> 00:42:03.271
- What if that idiot doesn't return?
- Should I go get him?

00:42:03.355 --> 00:42:06.733
Yeah, you should go get him. Gosh.

00:42:09.402 --> 00:42:10.987
Where do you think he is?

00:42:12.697 --> 00:42:13.782
I miss him.

00:42:53.405 --> 00:42:55.615
- Oh, really?
- Yep.

00:44:50.313 --> 00:44:53.608
ECOLOGICAL LAUNDRY

00:45:51.040 --> 00:45:52.417
Why did you want to see me?

00:45:53.626 --> 00:45:58.131
Ro-a's school has a long break.
I'll be there for a while.

00:45:59.007 --> 00:46:01.426
You should come straight to New York
from Barcelona.

00:46:02.343 --> 00:46:03.845
Ro-a says she misses her aunt.

00:46:04.721 --> 00:46:07.015
Just go and enjoy mother-daughter time.

00:46:12.854 --> 00:46:14.022
{\an8}Here.

00:46:14.606 --> 00:46:15.523
What's this?

00:46:15.607 --> 00:46:19.444
You might need your dopamine recharged
before going faraway to work.

00:46:22.405 --> 00:46:24.449
Let me see…

00:46:33.333 --> 00:46:36.794
Seo Ji-yeon. You have a taste.

00:46:36.878 --> 00:46:40.423
So let's have fun in New York
with your sister who has a taste.

00:46:43.384 --> 00:46:47.931
I'll use this every day. I love it.
No way you picked this on your own.

00:46:48.014 --> 00:46:51.309
- Who was it? Who? It wasn't you.
- I don't like you anymore.

00:46:51.392 --> 00:46:52.685
Yeah, it was Secretary Cha.

00:47:03.530 --> 00:47:05.365
Don't worry about me and have a safe trip.

00:47:08.034 --> 00:47:09.035
Okay.

00:47:11.037 --> 00:47:12.038
Bye.

00:47:15.083 --> 00:47:16.084
Director Seo.

00:47:17.794 --> 00:47:18.836
Did you arrive early?

00:47:18.920 --> 00:47:20.547
I just got here.

00:47:20.630 --> 00:47:21.839
- Shall we go?
- Yes.

00:47:28.346 --> 00:47:31.683
{\an8}BARCELONA

00:48:24.902 --> 00:48:28.740
Hey, Ji-yeon. Is Ro-a having fun?

00:48:29.657 --> 00:48:30.658
Nice.

00:48:32.285 --> 00:48:34.412
The team manager and everyone
left already.

00:48:35.079 --> 00:48:36.080
Yeah.

00:48:37.373 --> 00:48:41.377
Well… I plan to stay here
for a few more days.

00:48:43.296 --> 00:48:45.673
Me? I have so many places to go.

00:48:46.341 --> 00:48:48.926
I plan to fly to England
and meet Daniel before I go.

00:48:51.346 --> 00:48:53.014
I can have fun by myself.

00:48:54.474 --> 00:48:57.477
Yes, sure. Say hi to Ro-a for me.

00:48:58.394 --> 00:49:00.021
Yeah, you too.

00:49:57.787 --> 00:50:01.207
{\an8}MÁLAGA

00:52:09.335 --> 00:52:10.503
- Hola.
- Hola.

00:52:11.337 --> 00:52:13.172
Hola, buenas tardes.

00:52:56.215 --> 00:52:57.550
Kyeong-do.

00:53:01.971 --> 00:53:03.180
Kyeong-do.

00:53:15.526 --> 00:53:17.069
Kyeong-do.

00:53:40.509 --> 00:53:41.552
This place…

00:53:46.349 --> 00:53:47.350
Hola.

00:53:47.433 --> 00:53:48.434
Hola.

00:55:37.585 --> 00:55:39.587
MÁLAGA-COSTA DEL SOL AIRPORT

00:56:16.499 --> 00:56:18.918
INCOMING CALL
JEONG-MIN

00:56:21.420 --> 00:56:22.421
Hi, Jeong-min.

00:56:26.258 --> 00:56:28.511
Jeong-min, what's wrong?

00:56:35.518 --> 00:56:36.936
INCOMING CALL
JEONG-MIN

00:56:37.728 --> 00:56:38.729
Hi, Jeong-min.

00:57:01.752 --> 00:57:03.003
Kyeong-do,

00:57:04.964 --> 00:57:08.050
I had a good feeling
about this particular show.

00:57:10.469 --> 00:57:12.012
The movement was easy,

00:57:13.139 --> 00:57:14.723
and the lines were easy to memorize.

00:57:17.059 --> 00:57:19.228
I was worried a bit
because the theater was old.

00:57:21.313 --> 00:57:22.690
But then…

00:57:24.608 --> 00:57:25.609
there was a fire.

00:57:25.693 --> 00:57:28.320
ROOM 5
CHA WOO-SIK

00:57:28.404 --> 00:57:30.489
(CHIEF MOURNER) PARK SE-YEONG
(CHILD) CHA DONG-WON

00:57:30.573 --> 00:57:34.952
It would've been nice if I had gotten out
after the last audience did…

00:57:37.288 --> 00:57:38.998
but the entrance collapsed.

00:57:41.375 --> 00:57:42.585
So, Kyeong-do…

00:57:45.045 --> 00:57:46.630
so I…

00:57:49.175 --> 00:57:50.217
Kyeong-do.

00:58:05.900 --> 00:58:06.984
Kyeong-do.

00:58:08.694 --> 00:58:09.820
Jeong-min.

00:59:30.943 --> 00:59:32.820
Woo-sik…

00:59:34.989 --> 00:59:36.448
Woo-sik…

00:59:37.324 --> 00:59:39.118
How could this happen?

00:59:43.497 --> 00:59:44.957
How?

00:59:47.626 --> 00:59:48.836
Shit…

01:00:24.788 --> 01:00:25.956
Have you been well?

01:00:29.001 --> 01:00:30.002
So-so.

01:00:39.720 --> 01:00:42.014
Is Dong-won sleeping?

01:00:42.097 --> 01:00:43.098
Yes.

01:00:59.698 --> 01:01:02.159
When our parents met before the wedding,

01:01:03.369 --> 01:01:06.205
my dad kept apologizing.

01:01:06.288 --> 01:01:08.123
It offended me.

01:01:10.334 --> 01:01:13.212
I was probably upset
because I felt guilty.

01:01:14.338 --> 01:01:16.715
You know how capricious I am.

01:01:19.051 --> 01:01:23.931
No matter how much I think about it,

01:01:26.100 --> 01:01:29.228
I don't have any memories
of hating Woo-sik.

01:01:32.564 --> 01:01:34.900
He really did everything the way I wanted.

01:01:38.487 --> 01:01:40.614
My dad was right.

01:01:42.199 --> 01:01:43.534
I feel bad for him.

01:01:46.662 --> 01:01:48.455
But you were good to him too.

01:01:48.539 --> 01:01:49.998
Right.

01:01:50.624 --> 01:01:53.710
Woo-sik didn't make a lot of money
from his acting jobs.

01:01:54.336 --> 01:01:56.422
He was thankful
that you never nagged at him.

01:01:58.298 --> 01:02:00.467
I thought about Woo-sik on my way here.

01:02:02.177 --> 01:02:05.347
I'm glad he got
to perform Waiting for Godot.

01:02:07.266 --> 01:02:09.309
Like a fool, I thought about that.

01:02:51.268 --> 01:02:53.437
FOREVER FRIEND
LATE CHA WOO-SIK RESTS HERE FOREVER

01:03:17.544 --> 01:03:18.921
Where are you staying these days?

01:03:27.387 --> 01:03:29.932
I actually went to Málaga.

01:03:31.808 --> 01:03:34.853
After a business trip to Barcelona.

01:03:36.146 --> 01:03:37.981
The flea market was still there.

01:03:41.401 --> 01:03:42.402
Ji-woo.

01:03:47.241 --> 01:03:49.451
Those times
when you left far away from me...

01:03:51.828 --> 01:03:53.497
I thought a lot...

01:03:55.415 --> 01:03:59.169
about how much it must've been painful
to you during those times.

01:04:06.218 --> 01:04:10.847
When you were left here,
your days must've been hollow.

01:04:12.849 --> 01:04:15.102
That's what I thought too.

01:04:23.110 --> 01:04:24.319
Are you going back?

01:04:28.490 --> 01:04:30.492
Well, I left in a rush.

01:04:35.455 --> 01:04:36.456
When?

01:04:37.833 --> 01:04:40.836
After I take my dad to the hospital
for his medical checkup,

01:04:42.129 --> 01:04:43.130
I'm leaving.

01:04:46.508 --> 01:04:49.678
Right. You should leave.

01:06:37.369 --> 01:06:41.248
I keep thinking if I'm a kind man.

01:06:51.174 --> 01:06:56.388
Some wise man said
that one's kindness eventually pays off.

01:07:03.687 --> 01:07:05.897
Mother, what time is Kyeong-do's flight?

01:07:05.981 --> 01:07:07.065
What?

01:07:11.278 --> 01:07:13.280
You should've called earlier.

01:07:13.363 --> 01:07:16.533
Don't talk. Focus on driving.
If I miss him, it's your fault.

01:07:16.616 --> 01:07:18.994
What if you catch him?
Will you make him stay this time?

01:07:19.077 --> 01:07:21.580
Say it right now.
Just live together already!

01:07:21.663 --> 01:07:22.956
Drive faster!

01:07:23.039 --> 01:07:24.124
Damn it.

01:07:26.793 --> 01:07:32.090
If you have memories
of me being kind, and…

01:07:33.759 --> 01:07:37.179
if life sends you to me for one last time…

01:07:41.349 --> 01:07:43.351
May I have your attention, please?

01:07:44.519 --> 01:07:45.896
Lee Kyeong-do!

01:07:51.860 --> 01:07:52.986
Kyeong-do.

01:08:01.411 --> 01:08:02.579
Don't go.

01:08:05.415 --> 01:08:06.625
I…

01:08:06.708 --> 01:08:08.794
I don't mind.

01:08:10.253 --> 01:08:12.255
I don't mind at all. I...

01:08:12.923 --> 01:08:14.800
I'm fine with the adulteress stigma.

01:08:17.135 --> 01:08:18.887
It doesn't upset me at all.

01:08:20.347 --> 01:08:22.766
But living without you upsets me the most.

01:08:28.730 --> 01:08:30.774
You're the only one I like.

01:08:32.567 --> 01:08:36.363
As long as I have you, I don't mind
the slimy sink in Yeonnam-dong.

01:08:38.406 --> 01:08:41.326
Just... Just one thing.

01:08:42.452 --> 01:08:43.453
You.

01:08:45.372 --> 01:08:46.873
You're the only one I like.

01:09:03.557 --> 01:09:04.808
It's heavy.

01:09:06.518 --> 01:09:07.519
No.

01:09:09.521 --> 01:09:10.355
You can't go.

01:09:45.390 --> 01:09:46.391
Let's go.

01:09:49.436 --> 01:09:50.645
Let's go home.

01:09:52.731 --> 01:09:53.732
Let's go…

01:09:58.820 --> 01:09:59.821
and live together.

01:10:31.353 --> 01:10:32.604
In the end,

01:10:34.064 --> 01:10:35.065
I surrender...

01:10:37.400 --> 01:10:38.234
to our time.

01:11:29.160 --> 01:11:32.414
{\an8}You and I probably have healthy livers,
right?

01:11:32.497 --> 01:11:33.581
{\an8}I guess so?

01:11:35.583 --> 01:11:38.294
{\an8}We don't drink. We don't smoke.

01:11:38.378 --> 01:11:40.380
{\an8}We must be in excellent shape.

01:11:42.215 --> 01:11:46.428
{\an8}I had a medical checkup. I'm no joke.
They say I'm like in my 20s.

01:11:52.100 --> 01:11:54.060
{\an8}People can be very cunning.

01:12:03.028 --> 01:12:04.612
{\an8}This coffee smells nice.

01:12:06.239 --> 01:12:08.992
{\an8}I thought I wouldn't need anything
as long as I had you.

01:12:09.492 --> 01:12:11.411
{\an8}And that is still true, but…

01:12:12.912 --> 01:12:17.042
{\an8}The thing about greed is…

01:12:19.044 --> 01:12:20.420
{\an8}Look, Lee Kyeong-do.

01:12:21.212 --> 01:12:23.089
{\an8}We're in our best shape.

01:12:24.215 --> 01:12:25.216
{\an8}Yeah.

01:12:25.800 --> 01:12:27.135
{\an8}Then what should we do?

01:12:34.976 --> 01:12:36.102
{\an8}Uh, exercise?

01:12:40.690 --> 01:12:41.691
{\an8}We should have a baby.

01:12:42.358 --> 01:12:43.193
{\an8}What?

01:12:44.152 --> 01:12:46.279
{\an8}Let's have a baby
who looks like you and me.

01:12:47.030 --> 01:12:49.866
{\an8}I'm already of advanced maternal age.
We need to rush.

01:12:49.949 --> 01:12:53.411
{\an8}Hey, Ji-woo.
We need to discuss in depth and plan--

01:12:53.495 --> 01:12:55.246
{\an8}Are you scared that they'd take after me?

01:12:57.624 --> 01:12:58.666
{\an8}That too.

01:13:01.503 --> 01:13:02.754
{\an8}Let's go.

01:13:02.837 --> 01:13:03.880
{\an8}Go where?

01:13:04.839 --> 01:13:07.550
{\an8}I said, we don't have much time.
Let's have a baby.

01:13:09.094 --> 01:13:10.637
{\an8}- Where to?
- Your house.

01:13:11.304 --> 01:13:13.306
{\an8}That place has good energy. Let's go.

01:13:14.933 --> 01:13:17.227
{\an8}Hey, wait. But it's broad daylight.

01:13:17.310 --> 01:13:19.229
{\an8}Seriously. Stop complaining and follow me.

01:13:20.105 --> 01:13:22.941
{\an8}No. Wait, this is baffling.

01:13:23.024 --> 01:13:28.196
Come on. This is all a natural process.
We should get it started.

01:13:28.988 --> 01:13:30.490
What? Start what?

01:13:30.573 --> 01:13:35.620
{\an8}THANK YOU FOR WATCHING SURELY TOMORROW.
