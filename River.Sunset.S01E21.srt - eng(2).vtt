00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:35.319
His jawbone

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:38.239
was injured by a villager with a hoe.

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:39.480
He cannot speak.

00:01:39.480 --> 00:01:41.000
Jawbone?

00:02:16.759 --> 00:02:17.280
Are you trying to confirm

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:18.400
if he is that American?

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:23.599
What is the most important thing for a policeman?

00:02:24.159 --> 00:02:26.039
To always maintain your ability to doubt everything.

00:02:27.879 --> 00:02:29.159
You brought this on yourself.

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:08.400
Master.

00:03:09.800 --> 00:03:11.599
Has the letter to the island been sent?

00:03:11.599 --> 00:03:13.400
It was sent before dawn.

00:03:17.039 --> 00:03:19.280
Brother Erhu failed and was killed.

00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:20.919
Besides being sad,

00:03:21.919 --> 00:03:23.080
I am also anxious.

00:03:24.240 --> 00:03:27.240
I tossed and turned all night, unable to sleep.

00:03:28.520 --> 00:03:29.719
Master, (Support Admin Watch on
kissasia.cam or kisskh.org)

00:03:30.759 --> 00:03:32.719
please don't be overly anxious.

00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:34.879
That Chief Shen from the Nationalist government,

00:03:34.879 --> 00:03:37.080
didn't he promise to help us?

00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:42.319
Chief Shen and Wu Fazai's visit

00:03:42.319 --> 00:03:44.400
gave me some slight relief,

00:03:44.919 --> 00:03:46.520
but I still have doubts.

00:03:48.240 --> 00:03:49.960
Why would a high official of the Nationalist government

00:03:49.960 --> 00:03:52.080
be so willing to help us?

00:03:53.039 --> 00:03:56.039
Don't they also have people trapped on the island?

00:03:58.120 --> 00:03:59.599
Speaking of Ying'er,

00:04:00.639 --> 00:04:01.840
going back to that island at a time like this...

00:04:01.840 --> 00:04:03.159
what for?

00:04:03.879 --> 00:04:05.199
She is just a girl.

00:04:06.599 --> 00:04:07.400
How could she possibly

00:04:07.400 --> 00:04:08.599
get the Nationalists trapped on the island

00:04:08.599 --> 00:04:09.719
out of there?

00:04:10.599 --> 00:04:11.560
It seems

00:04:11.960 --> 00:04:13.080
those Nationalist people

00:04:13.080 --> 00:04:15.360
are just grasping at straws in their desperation.

00:04:17.279 --> 00:04:19.000
So we must urgently think of a way.

00:04:19.959 --> 00:04:21.959
If anything happens to my niece,

00:04:22.600 --> 00:04:23.680
my sworn brother

00:04:23.680 --> 00:04:25.000
will be thrown into chaos.

00:04:25.759 --> 00:04:27.879
The Ye family has only this one daughter.

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:30.959
She is the apple of his eye.

00:04:34.720 --> 00:04:35.480
Master,

00:04:36.040 --> 00:04:37.399
eat something first.

00:04:37.800 --> 00:04:40.920
In a while, the leaders of the various branches

00:04:41.160 --> 00:04:42.160
will be coming over.

00:04:42.160 --> 00:04:43.319
They are waiting to see you.

00:04:44.879 --> 00:04:45.759
That's why I'm also anxious

00:04:45.759 --> 00:04:47.279
to see these leaders

00:04:47.279 --> 00:04:48.759
and discuss this matter properly.

00:04:49.639 --> 00:04:50.519
Go and get ready.

00:05:07.959 --> 00:05:08.759
Ke Wen.

00:05:09.720 --> 00:05:10.480
Ke Wen.

00:05:10.720 --> 00:05:11.639
What's wrong?

00:05:12.480 --> 00:05:13.199
Ke Wen.

00:05:13.480 --> 00:05:15.079
Ke Wen.

00:05:15.759 --> 00:05:16.560
Biying.

00:05:18.639 --> 00:05:19.600
Ying'er.

00:05:19.600 --> 00:05:20.800
What happened?

00:05:21.319 --> 00:05:22.600
How did you get hurt like this?

00:05:27.480 --> 00:05:28.279
Come.

00:05:28.399 --> 00:05:29.480
Let me see.

00:05:34.399 --> 00:05:34.879
Come.

00:05:35.560 --> 00:05:36.519
Help me hold this down.

00:05:36.920 --> 00:05:38.279
Help me hold it down.

00:05:38.480 --> 00:05:39.199
It hurts.

00:05:40.040 --> 00:05:40.600
Hold it down.

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:46.680
Come.

00:05:46.680 --> 00:05:47.480
Ke Wen, come.

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:52.720
Don't move.

00:05:53.079 --> 00:05:53.560
Be good.

00:05:53.560 --> 00:05:54.279
Don't move.

00:05:54.399 --> 00:05:55.480
It'll be fine in a moment.

00:06:08.480 --> 00:06:09.639
Don't move.

00:06:09.639 --> 00:06:10.720
It'll be fine in a moment.

00:06:14.480 --> 00:06:15.079
Ke Wen.

00:06:15.279 --> 00:06:16.000
Come.

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:17.079
It will hurt for a second.

00:06:19.839 --> 00:06:20.519
It's okay now.

00:06:23.360 --> 00:06:24.639
Where else are you injured?

00:06:24.639 --> 00:06:25.519
Where does it hurt?

00:06:26.680 --> 00:06:27.920
It hurts.

00:06:27.920 --> 00:06:28.879
I'll take you back first.

00:06:29.160 --> 00:06:29.680
Let's go.

00:06:29.720 --> 00:06:30.480
Go home.

00:06:30.480 --> 00:06:31.319
Let's go.

00:06:42.959 --> 00:06:43.480
It hurts

00:06:45.759 --> 00:06:46.319
Don't hit me

00:06:46.319 --> 00:06:46.879
Ke Wen

00:06:46.879 --> 00:06:48.199
Don't hit me

00:06:49.319 --> 00:06:49.839
Ke Wen

00:06:50.560 --> 00:06:51.959
Don't hit me

00:06:52.480 --> 00:06:53.920
Don't hit me

00:06:54.759 --> 00:06:56.600
You're the ones who beat Ke Wen like this

00:06:57.279 --> 00:06:58.079
Yes

00:06:59.199 --> 00:07:00.759
Just joking around with him

00:07:02.240 --> 00:07:03.480
Joking?

00:07:06.720 --> 00:07:07.519
What are you doing?

00:07:07.759 --> 00:07:08.399
What are you doing?

00:07:08.399 --> 00:07:08.879
Let him go

00:07:09.079 --> 00:07:09.720
Let him go

00:07:09.959 --> 00:07:10.360
Let him go

00:07:10.360 --> 00:07:11.040
Come here

00:07:11.040 --> 00:07:11.959
Stand still

00:07:18.839 --> 00:07:20.800
Right, right, right

00:07:20.800 --> 00:07:22.480
Wrapping it like that

00:07:23.040 --> 00:07:24.480
It's certainly very professional

00:07:28.480 --> 00:07:29.560
Miss Ye

00:07:31.480 --> 00:07:33.000
You really are a professional

00:07:34.360 --> 00:07:35.480
What are you saying?

00:07:35.480 --> 00:07:36.399
I don't understand

00:07:36.879 --> 00:07:38.639
I didn't know Shanghai dancers

00:07:38.639 --> 00:07:41.199
besides singing and dancing

00:07:42.120 --> 00:07:43.959
were also trained in bandaging

00:07:45.040 --> 00:07:46.480
Which madam taught you that?

00:07:55.319 --> 00:07:58.120
Do you need to think before answering me?

00:08:01.240 --> 00:08:02.120
It doesn't matter

00:08:03.839 --> 00:08:04.959
Over there is

00:08:05.639 --> 00:08:06.879
a place to drink tea

00:08:07.360 --> 00:08:08.800
We can think about it slowly

00:08:10.240 --> 00:08:11.319
What's wrong?

00:08:11.319 --> 00:08:12.480
I won't go

00:08:12.480 --> 00:08:13.680
I need to bandage him

00:08:15.720 --> 00:08:16.480
Let me go

00:08:16.879 --> 00:08:17.360
Let go

00:08:18.519 --> 00:08:19.079
Ke Wen

00:08:19.959 --> 00:08:20.680
Ke Wen

00:08:20.920 --> 00:08:21.560
Ke Wen

00:08:21.879 --> 00:08:22.560
Ke Wen

00:08:25.480 --> 00:08:26.480
Miss Ye

00:08:27.720 --> 00:08:29.120
Will you bandage me up?

00:08:46.759 --> 00:08:47.639
They bullied Ke Wen

00:08:48.320 --> 00:08:49.480
Captain Oshima

00:08:52.360 --> 00:08:53.000
It's all right now

00:08:53.399 --> 00:08:54.320
It's all right now

00:08:54.360 --> 00:08:55.120
It's okay

00:08:56.039 --> 00:08:58.320
It's okay

00:08:59.000 --> 00:08:59.639
It's okay

00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:03.600
Ye Biying, did you bandage him?

00:09:06.799 --> 00:09:08.200
Did you tie this knot?

00:09:08.720 --> 00:09:10.080
How do I usually teach you?

00:09:10.320 --> 00:09:11.759
How can you tie it so tight?

00:09:11.759 --> 00:09:13.360
What if it cuts off blood circulation to the head?

00:09:15.679 --> 00:09:16.480
Are you trying to harm him?

00:09:16.480 --> 00:09:17.480
Or are you trying to save him?

00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:18.759
I'm sorry

00:09:18.759 --> 00:09:20.000
I'll learn to do it better next time

00:09:21.600 --> 00:09:22.360
Colonel

00:09:23.279 --> 00:09:24.039
I tied the knot

00:09:24.039 --> 00:09:24.759
They were the ones who beat him

00:09:24.759 --> 00:09:25.480
Shut up

00:09:27.399 --> 00:09:28.000
Colonel

00:09:28.600 --> 00:09:29.320
Mmh

00:09:32.399 --> 00:09:36.240
I just invited Miss Ye over to my place

00:09:36.519 --> 00:09:38.240
Why don't you join us?

00:09:38.240 --> 00:09:39.639
I'm sorry, Captain Oshima

00:09:39.879 --> 00:09:41.200
The Commander needs to see me urgently

00:09:41.200 --> 00:09:42.320
I have to go over there

00:09:42.320 --> 00:09:43.120
Next time

00:09:43.120 --> 00:09:44.320
Next time, Miss Ye and I will host

00:09:44.320 --> 00:09:45.000
And treat you to dinner

00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:47.000
We'll drink the same wine as last night

00:09:52.320 --> 00:09:54.600
Colonel, your woman is truly capable

00:09:54.960 --> 00:09:56.279
I was really surprised

00:09:59.840 --> 00:10:01.480
She used to be just a dancing girl

00:10:01.480 --> 00:10:02.919
Besides dancing with men

00:10:02.919 --> 00:10:03.879
and drinking with them

00:10:03.879 --> 00:10:04.799
she couldn't do anything else

00:10:05.039 --> 00:10:06.399
Now that she's with me

00:10:06.399 --> 00:10:08.120
she can't do those things anymore, right?

00:10:08.120 --> 00:10:08.879
As soldiers

00:10:08.879 --> 00:10:10.360
we inevitably see some blood

00:10:10.360 --> 00:10:11.480
Teach her a bit more

00:10:11.480 --> 00:10:12.919
and it will be useful later

00:10:13.879 --> 00:10:15.200
You really think of everything

00:10:17.480 --> 00:10:18.759
There is one more thing

00:10:18.759 --> 00:10:20.240
I'd like to ask of you, Captain Oshima

00:10:21.159 --> 00:10:23.279
This Ke Wen is my assistant's

00:10:23.279 --> 00:10:24.720
childhood playmate

00:10:24.720 --> 00:10:25.919
He's just a fool

00:10:25.919 --> 00:10:27.679
Why bother with him?

00:10:28.720 --> 00:10:30.879
It's just a misunderstanding

00:10:31.399 --> 00:10:32.759
If it's a misunderstanding, that's easy

00:10:32.759 --> 00:10:34.279
Just explain it clearly

00:10:34.720 --> 00:10:36.720
So, I'll take that as a yes

00:10:37.120 --> 00:10:37.759
Of course

00:10:38.399 --> 00:10:39.399
Thank you

00:10:40.600 --> 00:10:41.399
Excuse me

00:10:41.960 --> 00:10:43.000
Excuse me

00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:43.480
Ke Wen

00:10:43.480 --> 00:10:43.879
It hurts

00:10:45.159 --> 00:10:45.720
Ke Wen

00:10:46.159 --> 00:10:46.840
Ke Wen

00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:47.639
Ye Biying

00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:48.720
Ke Wen

00:10:50.600 --> 00:10:51.799
Sorry, Captain Oshima

00:10:52.279 --> 00:10:53.639
You should hurry back and rest

00:10:53.639 --> 00:10:54.879
Excuse me

00:10:56.360 --> 00:10:57.320
Thank you

00:11:01.080 --> 00:11:02.360
It hurts so much

00:11:15.159 --> 00:11:16.080
Don't look back

00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:17.919
Don't look back

00:11:20.720 --> 00:11:22.000
I have something urgent to tell you

00:11:22.279 --> 00:11:23.399
We'll talk when we get back

00:12:00.279 --> 00:12:01.720
Replacement "Believer"

00:12:01.720 --> 00:12:03.039
en route to China

00:12:03.039 --> 00:12:04.879
died in a plane crash.

00:12:04.879 --> 00:12:06.840
"Lumberjack" must do his utmost to execute

00:12:06.840 --> 00:12:07.840
Plan A,

00:12:08.080 --> 00:12:09.360
to safely extract the trapped person.

00:12:10.360 --> 00:12:11.360
Remember this.

00:12:11.360 --> 00:12:12.480
Investigation is going smoothly.

00:12:12.480 --> 00:12:13.480
Shen.

00:12:16.200 --> 00:12:17.399
What does it say?

00:12:19.559 --> 00:12:20.960
Chief Shen has arrived in Macau.

00:12:21.399 --> 00:12:22.879
He has changed our mission.

00:12:23.080 --> 00:12:23.639
He requires us

00:12:23.639 --> 00:12:24.600
to ensure Major Witt

00:12:24.600 --> 00:12:25.799
is safely sent out of Sanzao Island.

00:12:26.679 --> 00:12:27.759
So how do we do that?

00:12:28.399 --> 00:12:29.120
He wants us to execute

00:12:29.120 --> 00:12:30.480
the first evacuation plan.

00:12:30.960 --> 00:12:31.639
Re-survey

00:12:31.639 --> 00:12:33.000
the crash site of Osumi Mineo.

00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:33.960
Go to Mount Huangyang.

00:12:35.600 --> 00:12:36.840
Is it dangerous?

00:12:37.720 --> 00:12:38.519
Chief Shen will bring men

00:12:38.519 --> 00:12:39.720
to ambush there in advance.

00:12:39.720 --> 00:12:41.279
There will be a firefight.

00:12:41.279 --> 00:12:42.480
Then I'll go with you.

00:12:42.720 --> 00:12:43.320
No.

00:12:43.320 --> 00:12:44.240
I want to go.

00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:52.879
Although

00:12:53.480 --> 00:12:55.879
you're usually quite annoying,

00:12:57.200 --> 00:12:58.799
I am a doctor, after all.

00:12:59.039 --> 00:13:00.840
Besides, I'm your assistant.

00:13:00.840 --> 00:13:01.480
You can't go.

00:13:01.480 --> 00:13:02.919
That is my order.

00:13:08.559 --> 00:13:09.360
Don't worry.

00:13:09.799 --> 00:13:10.679
The bullet that can kill me

00:13:10.679 --> 00:13:11.720
hasn't been made yet.

00:13:14.480 --> 00:13:15.240
Then you...

00:13:15.679 --> 00:13:17.399
be careful and stay safe.

00:13:18.360 --> 00:13:19.399
I will be careful.

00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:21.919
To restart

00:13:21.919 --> 00:13:23.720
the investigation of Osumi's crash site,

00:13:23.720 --> 00:13:25.720
I need Commander Fujita's approval.

00:13:25.720 --> 00:13:27.000
I'll take you home first,

00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:28.200
then go to headquarters.

00:13:31.799 --> 00:13:32.559
Let's go.

00:13:47.840 --> 00:13:48.279
Before going home,

00:13:48.279 --> 00:13:49.600
can I go to the hospital?

00:13:49.919 --> 00:13:51.399
I'm worried about the Major's injuries.

00:13:53.000 --> 00:13:54.960
You'd better forget you're a doctor.

00:13:56.240 --> 00:13:57.240
How can I?

00:13:58.480 --> 00:13:59.639
The Police Brigade just lost

00:13:59.639 --> 00:14:00.679
the trail.

00:14:00.960 --> 00:14:02.240
If you go there now,

00:14:02.559 --> 00:14:03.879
you'll be leading them right to him.

00:14:08.480 --> 00:14:09.240
Okay.

00:14:09.600 --> 00:14:10.480
I'll listen to you.

00:14:37.280 --> 00:14:38.480
You go back first.

00:14:50.480 --> 00:14:51.960
The news that the replacement "Believer"

00:14:51.960 --> 00:14:53.840
died in a plane crash

00:14:53.840 --> 00:14:56.039
shocked Takeki greatly.

00:14:56.480 --> 00:14:57.320
At this moment,

00:14:57.320 --> 00:15:00.000
while doing his best to save Witt,

00:15:00.399 --> 00:15:01.799
he also needs to clarify

00:15:02.120 --> 00:15:05.240
exactly what kind of military plan

00:15:05.240 --> 00:15:07.879
is underway between China and the US.

00:15:13.399 --> 00:15:14.279
Hurry, hurry.

00:15:43.080 --> 00:15:44.120
Are you ready?

00:15:44.320 --> 00:15:45.480
Look what I got.

00:15:49.080 --> 00:15:50.639
She's been watching you all night.

00:15:53.159 --> 00:15:55.120
May I have this dance?

00:15:56.320 --> 00:15:58.120
What are you waiting for?

00:16:00.840 --> 00:16:02.480
Davenport, what's wrong with you?

00:16:02.480 --> 00:16:03.639
Coward.

00:16:05.480 --> 00:16:06.320
Please give it back.

00:16:06.320 --> 00:16:06.960
Please.

00:16:06.960 --> 00:16:09.039
I'll give you something better.

00:16:10.840 --> 00:16:11.759
Thanks, Bill.

00:16:22.519 --> 00:16:24.200
Bill, that girl is nice.

00:16:24.200 --> 00:16:25.200
Did you tell her

00:16:25.200 --> 00:16:26.159
where we're going?

00:16:26.159 --> 00:16:26.799
No.

00:16:27.080 --> 00:16:28.799
These Army guys shouldn't be here.

00:16:29.639 --> 00:16:31.000
The smell of their leather jackets

00:16:31.000 --> 00:16:32.799
is making me seasick.

00:16:32.799 --> 00:16:34.960
You get seasick anyway.

00:16:44.960 --> 00:16:45.519
Come here.

00:16:47.120 --> 00:16:48.600
Just do as I say.

00:16:50.120 --> 00:16:51.480
I have to hang up.

00:16:59.600 --> 00:17:00.600
What will you have, Lieutenant Colonel?

00:17:00.639 --> 00:17:01.559
Whiskey.

00:17:01.720 --> 00:17:03.159
Two whiskeys.

00:17:05.680 --> 00:17:07.200
Do you know I used to be a pilot?

00:17:08.119 --> 00:17:08.799
I know.

00:17:09.240 --> 00:17:11.200
I'm a pilot-turned-

00:17:11.640 --> 00:17:12.960
aircraft carrier captain.

00:17:13.720 --> 00:17:14.480
Doolittle.

00:17:14.480 --> 00:17:14.960
Over the years,

00:17:14.960 --> 00:17:16.000
I've heard many legendary stories about you.

00:17:16.000 --> 00:17:17.359
To work with you

00:17:18.319 --> 00:17:19.759
is my honor.

00:17:19.759 --> 00:17:21.079
Likewise,

00:17:21.079 --> 00:17:22.000
Captain.

00:17:22.400 --> 00:17:23.400
Between the Navy and the Army,

00:17:23.400 --> 00:17:25.680
there has always been a deep-seated rivalry.

00:17:26.359 --> 00:17:28.000
For Army pilots on an aircraft carrier

00:17:28.000 --> 00:17:29.799
to receive your warm hospitality...

00:17:30.880 --> 00:17:31.799
Did you notice

00:17:31.799 --> 00:17:32.759
what's on the Hornet's smokestack?

00:17:32.759 --> 00:17:34.720
It says "Remember Pearl Harbor."

00:17:35.119 --> 00:17:36.079
Since then,

00:17:36.079 --> 00:17:36.920
these young men

00:17:36.920 --> 00:17:38.839
have been longing to take revenge on Japan.

00:17:39.240 --> 00:17:39.920
But

00:17:39.920 --> 00:17:41.599
even in the wildest imagination,

00:17:41.599 --> 00:17:43.119
no one expected

00:17:43.119 --> 00:17:45.240
it would be through a group of Army pilots.

00:17:46.359 --> 00:17:47.599
Please accept my gratitude.

00:17:48.599 --> 00:17:49.319
I haven't yet thanked you

00:17:49.319 --> 00:17:50.039
for giving up your spacious captain's cabin

00:17:50.039 --> 00:17:50.720
to me.

00:17:50.720 --> 00:17:52.839
What a comfortable room.

00:17:53.200 --> 00:17:54.039
It's my honor.

00:17:54.880 --> 00:17:55.400
If I had known

00:17:55.400 --> 00:17:57.000
the Navy took such good care of their officers,

00:17:57.000 --> 00:17:59.079
I would have joined you from the start.

00:18:00.200 --> 00:18:01.359
You are always right,

00:18:03.359 --> 00:18:04.480
Lieutenant.

00:18:08.920 --> 00:18:09.960
What's the matter with these men?

00:18:11.119 --> 00:18:11.839
Sir.

00:18:11.839 --> 00:18:12.599
For the past month,

00:18:12.599 --> 00:18:13.759
these young men have been very eager

00:18:13.759 --> 00:18:15.279
and ready to execute the mission.

00:18:15.279 --> 00:18:16.480
Honestly,

00:18:17.319 --> 00:18:18.400
since the drawing of lots,

00:18:18.400 --> 00:18:20.480
they have been very frustrated.

00:18:23.119 --> 00:18:23.880
Mark.

00:18:24.880 --> 00:18:27.039
Can we find bunks for them?

00:18:28.400 --> 00:18:29.400
Lieutenant Colonel.

00:18:29.400 --> 00:18:31.680
The carrier has room for over two thousand crew

00:18:31.680 --> 00:18:33.400
and another twenty-two pilots.

00:18:33.400 --> 00:18:34.920
There is enough accommodation prepared.

00:18:35.079 --> 00:18:36.160
That's not a problem.

00:18:37.039 --> 00:18:37.599
I'm going to take them

00:18:37.599 --> 00:18:38.920
as reserve pilots.

00:18:39.880 --> 00:18:40.920
Thank you, sir.

00:18:40.920 --> 00:18:42.519
It means a lot to them.

00:18:45.079 --> 00:18:46.240
Jenny.

00:18:46.759 --> 00:18:48.359
Guess who's on our ship.

00:18:49.039 --> 00:18:51.000
James Doolittle.

00:18:51.759 --> 00:18:52.720
Don't you know him?

00:18:52.720 --> 00:18:54.079
Don't you watch the news?

00:18:54.559 --> 00:18:57.359
He's the most famous pilot in America.

00:18:57.640 --> 00:19:00.279
His men are the elite of the US Army.

00:19:00.279 --> 00:19:00.880
Them coming aboard means

00:19:00.920 --> 00:19:01.920
something big is definitely going to happen.

00:19:02.279 --> 00:19:03.359
Honey.

00:19:03.680 --> 00:19:05.119
Double my life insurance.

00:19:06.359 --> 00:19:06.880
Honey.

00:19:06.880 --> 00:19:07.359
I really don't know

00:19:07.359 --> 00:19:08.920
how long I'll be gone.

00:19:09.480 --> 00:19:11.880
We might be going to the Philippines.

00:19:12.200 --> 00:19:13.960
I really can't say too much.

00:19:14.319 --> 00:19:14.599
Yes.

00:19:14.599 --> 00:19:15.400
I love you too.

00:19:15.400 --> 00:19:16.039
Okay.

00:19:16.039 --> 00:19:17.240
I have something for you.

00:19:17.920 --> 00:19:19.079
To send to you.

00:19:19.559 --> 00:19:20.279
Mom.

00:19:20.279 --> 00:19:21.279
My baby.

00:19:21.279 --> 00:19:21.759
Mom.

00:19:21.759 --> 00:19:22.720
I miss you so much.

00:19:22.720 --> 00:19:23.599
Hey.

00:19:23.599 --> 00:19:24.680
I miss you too.

00:19:24.680 --> 00:19:25.640
How long will you be gone?

00:19:25.640 --> 00:19:26.920
I want to see you.

00:19:26.920 --> 00:19:27.599
Me too.

00:19:27.599 --> 00:19:29.319
I don't know how long I'll be away.

00:19:29.920 --> 00:19:34.519
Is everything okay over there?

00:19:35.960 --> 00:19:37.799
Can you do something for me?

00:19:37.799 --> 00:19:39.240
What is it?

00:19:41.559 --> 00:19:42.720
Can you check if Andy has

00:19:42.720 --> 00:19:43.960
cashed my paycheck?

00:19:44.279 --> 00:19:45.359
Yes, why?

00:19:45.359 --> 00:19:46.880
Is something wrong?

00:19:46.880 --> 00:19:47.799
Okay.

00:19:47.920 --> 00:19:48.880
I just...

00:19:48.880 --> 00:19:49.960
I don't know how long I'll be gone.

00:19:50.000 --> 00:19:50.839
That's all.

00:19:51.400 --> 00:19:53.759
I can help you, but...

00:19:53.759 --> 00:19:54.359
Alright.

00:19:54.359 --> 00:19:55.039
I have to go.

00:19:55.039 --> 00:19:55.799
I love you.

00:19:55.799 --> 00:19:57.680
I love you too, baby.

00:19:57.680 --> 00:19:58.480
See you when I get back.

00:19:58.480 --> 00:19:59.480
Bye, Mom.

00:19:59.480 --> 00:20:00.480
Bye.

00:20:29.240 --> 00:20:30.319
Commander.

00:20:30.319 --> 00:20:31.240
Adjutant Sakamoto.

00:20:34.799 --> 00:20:37.119
Want to change and come down for a try?

00:20:38.480 --> 00:20:39.119
Yes, sir.

00:20:54.960 --> 00:20:55.960
Allow me.

00:20:55.960 --> 00:20:56.799
Thank you.

00:22:24.000 --> 00:22:25.599
Your swordsmanship is excellent.

00:22:27.599 --> 00:22:28.680
Commander.

00:22:28.680 --> 00:22:30.359
You truly are from a samurai family.

00:22:30.759 --> 00:22:32.240
I am no match for you.

00:22:33.480 --> 00:22:35.079
Let's go rest over there for a bit.

00:22:35.519 --> 00:22:36.519
Yes, sir.

00:22:49.039 --> 00:22:50.079
I heard

00:22:50.880 --> 00:22:52.480
that yesterday you questioned the soldiers

00:22:52.480 --> 00:22:53.920
who serviced the special plane last year, didn't you?

00:22:55.000 --> 00:22:56.240
Did you find anything?

00:22:57.119 --> 00:22:58.799
Nothing so far.

00:23:10.519 --> 00:23:11.720
Come to my headquarters.

00:23:11.720 --> 00:23:12.960
You must have something to discuss.

00:23:14.480 --> 00:23:15.519
Commander.

00:23:16.400 --> 00:23:18.079
Actually, I came to report to you.

00:23:18.200 --> 00:23:19.319
I wish to take another team

00:23:19.319 --> 00:23:21.279
to Huangyang Mountain.

00:23:21.279 --> 00:23:23.119
The crash site of Admiral Osumi Mineo.

00:23:23.119 --> 00:23:24.839
To conduct another survey.

00:23:25.559 --> 00:23:26.160
Hmm.

00:23:27.799 --> 00:23:28.400
In that case,

00:23:28.720 --> 00:23:29.799
let's talk while we eat.

00:23:30.240 --> 00:23:30.960
Yes, sir.

00:23:41.160 --> 00:23:44.319
Perhaps what I say isn't very pleasant

00:23:44.319 --> 00:23:45.000
It has always been this way back home

00:23:45.000 --> 00:23:46.160
so bizarre and eccentric

00:23:46.799 --> 00:23:48.319
Prime Ministers, Ministers, Generals

00:23:48.319 --> 00:23:49.920
can be killed for sport at will

00:23:50.799 --> 00:23:52.039
and no one has to take responsibility

00:23:52.039 --> 00:23:53.160
Killing a high official

00:23:53.160 --> 00:23:54.559
or a general makes you a hero

00:23:55.240 --> 00:23:57.319
This isn't the first time

00:24:00.880 --> 00:24:02.680
I don't quite understand your meaning

00:24:04.599 --> 00:24:05.680
Let me give you an example

00:24:06.599 --> 00:24:07.480
Earlier there was a

00:24:07.480 --> 00:24:09.200
terrorist named Nakaoka Kon'ichi

00:24:09.200 --> 00:24:10.960
who assassinated Prime Minister Hara Takashi

00:24:11.519 --> 00:24:12.839
After the murderer was caught

00:24:13.039 --> 00:24:14.480
he was sent to the Dong Jing court

00:24:15.039 --> 00:24:16.000
The court stated

00:24:16.240 --> 00:24:18.039
the murderer Nakaoka Kon'ichi was only nineteen

00:24:18.039 --> 00:24:19.519
a minor who didn't know better

00:24:20.039 --> 00:24:21.000
When he grows up

00:24:21.000 --> 00:24:21.799
maybe he won't kill indiscriminately

00:24:21.799 --> 00:24:23.119
The focus should be on education

00:24:23.559 --> 00:24:24.799
so they pardoned him

00:24:25.960 --> 00:24:26.799
Yes

00:24:27.279 --> 00:24:28.319
These strange events back home

00:24:28.319 --> 00:24:29.480
emerge one after another

00:24:29.480 --> 00:24:30.720
I have heard of them too

00:24:32.079 --> 00:24:33.839
Do you know where Nakaoka Kon'ichi

00:24:33.839 --> 00:24:35.519
went after his pardon?

00:24:35.519 --> 00:24:36.960
What place did he go to?

00:24:38.119 --> 00:24:40.480
He became a guard at the Kwantung Army HQ in Manchuria

00:24:42.039 --> 00:24:43.599
I understand your meaning

00:24:44.480 --> 00:24:45.119
You are saying

00:24:45.119 --> 00:24:46.759
behind every murderer

00:24:47.000 --> 00:24:48.480
there is the support of the Army

00:24:50.000 --> 00:24:51.599
I never said that

00:24:52.279 --> 00:24:53.400
Young man

00:24:53.400 --> 00:24:54.920
I'm saying you are very talented

00:24:55.200 --> 00:24:58.200
Some things shouldn't be taken too seriously

00:25:07.079 --> 00:25:08.759
I've brought the milk up

00:25:09.440 --> 00:25:11.960
This milk is fresh from the cow

00:25:11.960 --> 00:25:13.599
Try it

00:25:13.599 --> 00:25:15.240
Really?

00:25:15.240 --> 00:25:16.079
That's amazing

00:25:16.079 --> 00:25:18.079
To be able to drink fresh milk here

00:25:18.640 --> 00:25:20.960
I specially had a transport ship

00:25:20.960 --> 00:25:22.880
bring two cows from Guangzhou

00:25:22.880 --> 00:25:24.319
Our Pioneer Group residents

00:25:24.319 --> 00:25:25.200
are raising them on the island

00:25:25.200 --> 00:25:26.519
That is why we have fresh milk

00:25:40.359 --> 00:25:41.640
The Colonel will stay at headquarters

00:25:41.640 --> 00:25:43.480
a little while longer

00:25:43.839 --> 00:25:44.759
The Commander means

00:25:44.759 --> 00:25:45.640
you can make your move now

00:25:45.640 --> 00:25:47.400
But you must be extremely careful

00:25:49.000 --> 00:25:51.640
The Commander will stall Colonel Takeki

00:25:53.359 --> 00:25:54.319
Act with caution

00:26:43.480 --> 00:26:44.680
Commander

00:26:45.920 --> 00:26:47.039
Based on your experience,

00:26:47.599 --> 00:26:48.319
should I...

00:26:48.319 --> 00:26:49.680
...give up this investigation?

00:26:51.119 --> 00:26:52.839
That's not what I meant.

00:26:52.839 --> 00:26:54.279
Then what do you mean?

00:26:58.359 --> 00:27:00.119
Remember the 2-2-6 Incident?

00:27:01.079 --> 00:27:03.519
February 26, Showa 11.

00:27:04.400 --> 00:27:06.279
Led by junior officers of the Imperial Way Faction,

00:27:06.720 --> 00:27:08.720
over 1,400 soldiers launched a coup.

00:27:08.720 --> 00:27:10.039
They surrounded the Prime Minister's Official Residence,

00:27:10.039 --> 00:27:11.480
the National Diet Building,

00:27:11.480 --> 00:27:12.400
the Army Ministry,

00:27:12.400 --> 00:27:14.640
the General Staff Office, and Police Headquarters.

00:27:14.960 --> 00:27:15.759
Then,

00:27:15.759 --> 00:27:17.559
they killed Lord Keeper of the Privy Seal, Saito Makoto,

00:27:17.839 --> 00:27:19.880
Finance Minister Takahashi Korekiyo,

00:27:20.119 --> 00:27:21.319
Inspector General of Military Training,

00:27:21.319 --> 00:27:23.279
General Watanabe Jotaro.

00:27:24.720 --> 00:27:26.240
Prime Minister Okada Keisuke...

00:27:26.240 --> 00:27:28.799
...only survived by hiding in a bathtub.

00:27:30.039 --> 00:27:30.799
Do you know, after the incident,

00:27:30.799 --> 00:27:32.160
what the Army's attitude was?

00:27:32.480 --> 00:27:33.799
What was the Army's attitude?

00:27:34.160 --> 00:27:37.000
After the incident, the Army...

00:27:37.400 --> 00:27:39.400
...remained ambiguous throughout.

00:27:39.400 --> 00:27:40.920
They didn't state their position.

00:27:41.319 --> 00:27:42.319
In the communiques issued by the Army,

00:27:42.319 --> 00:27:43.079
on the first day, they called them...

00:27:43.079 --> 00:27:46.559
..."deployed troops."

00:27:46.559 --> 00:27:47.359
Early the next morning,

00:27:47.359 --> 00:27:48.480
it changed to "uprising troops."

00:27:48.559 --> 00:27:50.400
In the afternoon, it changed to "occupying troops."

00:27:50.480 --> 00:27:51.079
It wasn't until the fourth day...

00:27:51.079 --> 00:27:51.799
...that they reluctantly called them...

00:27:51.799 --> 00:27:53.000
..."rebel troops."

00:27:53.359 --> 00:27:54.480
What about the Navy?

00:27:55.720 --> 00:27:57.079
The Navy, from the very beginning,

00:27:57.079 --> 00:27:58.720
called them rebel troops.

00:28:00.200 --> 00:28:01.160
Why?

00:28:02.759 --> 00:28:04.079
Why did the Army wait until the fourth day...

00:28:04.079 --> 00:28:05.720
...to awkwardly state their position?

00:28:06.039 --> 00:28:06.640
You serve in the Palace.

00:28:06.640 --> 00:28:08.279
You probably know the inside story.

00:28:08.960 --> 00:28:10.920
Because I heard His Majesty was furious.

00:28:11.559 --> 00:28:12.200
He threatened that...

00:28:12.200 --> 00:28:13.880
...if the Army couldn't suppress the rebellion,

00:28:14.160 --> 00:28:15.519
he would personally lead the Imperial Guard Division...

00:28:15.519 --> 00:28:17.599
...and go to conquer them himself.

00:28:18.839 --> 00:28:20.200
Only then did they reluctantly put in some effort...

00:28:20.200 --> 00:28:22.319
...and make a statement.

00:28:23.319 --> 00:28:24.240
Yes.

00:28:24.480 --> 00:28:26.400
The conflict between the Navy and the Army...

00:28:26.880 --> 00:28:28.799
...is already known to everyone.

00:28:32.519 --> 00:28:33.359
Therefore,

00:28:33.359 --> 00:28:35.799
if you're not careful with this investigation,

00:28:35.839 --> 00:28:37.200
it will make the conflict between the Navy and Army...

00:28:37.200 --> 00:28:39.319
...even more intense.

00:28:42.400 --> 00:28:44.480
Admiral Osumi's plane...

00:28:44.480 --> 00:28:45.279
...although it was maintained at my...

00:28:45.279 --> 00:28:47.039
...6th Naval Air Base,

00:28:47.039 --> 00:28:48.680
it did indeed fly back to Guangzhou,

00:28:48.680 --> 00:28:50.400
and at the Guangzhou Army Air Base,

00:28:50.400 --> 00:28:51.839
it took off and crashed.

00:28:52.319 --> 00:28:54.720
I'm just telling you this.

00:28:55.480 --> 00:28:56.519
Triggering the Navy and Army conflict...

00:28:56.519 --> 00:28:57.920
...to completely explode.

00:28:58.160 --> 00:29:00.200
Would it be as serious as you say?

00:29:03.599 --> 00:29:04.480
Let's go.

00:29:05.160 --> 00:29:05.720
Okay.

00:30:42.480 --> 00:30:43.079
Sir.

00:30:43.319 --> 00:30:44.720
Want to buy cigarettes?

00:30:48.160 --> 00:30:50.279
I'll buy all of them.

00:30:50.519 --> 00:30:51.559
Come with me.

00:30:52.680 --> 00:30:53.359
Sir.

00:30:53.720 --> 00:30:55.960
If you want to buy, buy them here.

00:30:58.119 --> 00:30:59.039
Today, I...

00:30:59.039 --> 00:31:00.680
...am not only taking your cigarettes,

00:31:00.839 --> 00:31:02.720
...I'm taking you too.

00:31:03.119 --> 00:31:04.000
Hahaha.

00:31:04.000 --> 00:31:04.960
Go to my room.

00:31:04.960 --> 00:31:05.839
No, I won't!

00:31:05.839 --> 00:31:06.599
I'm not selling anymore!

00:31:06.599 --> 00:31:07.640
Let's go.

00:31:07.640 --> 00:31:08.559
Come with me.

00:31:24.079 --> 00:31:25.839
You rat!

00:31:31.160 --> 00:31:33.759
You dare hit me?

00:31:39.759 --> 00:31:41.759
You dare hit me?

00:31:41.960 --> 00:31:44.480
I'll kill you!

00:31:49.480 --> 00:31:50.680
What is going on?

00:31:50.680 --> 00:31:51.880
Don't get involved, don't get involved.

00:31:57.279 --> 00:31:58.160
Sir.

00:31:58.480 --> 00:31:59.480
Does it hurt?

00:32:11.400 --> 00:32:12.160
Get out

00:32:12.359 --> 00:32:13.720
Look at you

00:32:13.720 --> 00:32:14.599
You didn't call me when you got here

00:32:14.599 --> 00:32:15.799
Why should I call you?

00:32:16.599 --> 00:32:18.759
The best opium is waiting for you

00:32:18.759 --> 00:32:19.680
Opium?

00:32:19.680 --> 00:32:21.519
Why would I smoke that?

00:32:22.480 --> 00:32:23.599
With you here

00:32:24.079 --> 00:32:25.599
why would I need opium?

00:32:25.599 --> 00:32:26.559
Brother

00:32:26.559 --> 00:32:27.680
Master Geng is looking for you

00:32:28.480 --> 00:32:29.160
Now?

00:32:29.160 --> 00:32:29.920
Now

00:32:30.319 --> 00:32:31.359
You should have said so sooner

00:32:32.480 --> 00:32:33.359
Master Duo

00:32:33.680 --> 00:32:34.720
Master Duo

00:32:38.039 --> 00:32:39.599
This Macau

00:32:39.599 --> 00:32:42.240
has really become an isolated island in the Pacific

00:32:42.720 --> 00:32:43.920
Except for us here

00:32:44.480 --> 00:32:45.640
the Japanese

00:32:45.640 --> 00:32:47.079
have occupied almost all other places

00:32:47.079 --> 00:32:48.079
completely

00:32:48.559 --> 00:32:50.079
Now, right here

00:32:50.880 --> 00:32:52.119
the adventurers

00:32:52.119 --> 00:32:53.359
the smugglers

00:32:53.920 --> 00:32:56.119
people from every gang and society

00:32:57.039 --> 00:32:58.279
can call the wind

00:32:58.279 --> 00:32:59.920
and summon the rain

00:33:01.079 --> 00:33:02.559
In comparison

00:33:02.960 --> 00:33:04.119
our Anlan Hall

00:33:04.119 --> 00:33:06.279
naturally pales in comparison

00:33:07.799 --> 00:33:08.640
Master

00:33:09.359 --> 00:33:11.759
as long as you and Master De on the island are here

00:33:12.000 --> 00:33:15.119
Anlan Hall can weather the wind and rain

00:33:20.119 --> 00:33:20.559
Master Geng

00:33:20.559 --> 00:33:22.000
The helm masters of the various halls have arrived

00:33:42.480 --> 00:33:43.240
Thank you

00:33:43.240 --> 00:33:44.240
Please enjoy

00:33:50.240 --> 00:33:50.920
Your Excellency

00:33:53.720 --> 00:33:54.559
I kept you waiting

00:33:54.559 --> 00:33:55.200
Not at all

00:33:55.920 --> 00:33:57.039
Sit down and let's talk

00:33:57.039 --> 00:33:57.880
Yes

00:34:06.319 --> 00:34:07.480
Speaking of which

00:34:07.920 --> 00:34:09.639
the discord between the Army and Navy

00:34:11.360 --> 00:34:15.239
has historical roots

00:34:16.119 --> 00:34:17.719
Starting from the Meiji era

00:34:17.719 --> 00:34:19.239
two major factions emerged

00:34:19.239 --> 00:34:21.079
After the Restoration back then

00:34:21.079 --> 00:34:22.400
Satsuma became the Navy

00:34:22.400 --> 00:34:24.199
Choshu became the Army

00:34:25.159 --> 00:34:27.559
And in the early days of the Meiji Restoration

00:34:28.239 --> 00:34:29.199
there was no parliament in the country

00:34:29.199 --> 00:34:29.920
no constitution

00:34:29.920 --> 00:34:31.639
it was entirely domain clique politics

00:34:32.480 --> 00:34:33.679
The Satsuma Domain and Choshu Domain

00:34:33.679 --> 00:34:35.000
each relied on their military power

00:34:35.400 --> 00:34:36.800
so the Army and Navy became

00:34:36.800 --> 00:34:38.480
tools for the various factions

00:34:38.599 --> 00:34:39.480
Indeed

00:34:39.480 --> 00:34:40.159
It has gone on until now

00:34:40.159 --> 00:34:41.519
where everyone is incompatible like fire and water

00:34:41.960 --> 00:34:43.519
Even when manufacturing a screw

00:34:43.760 --> 00:34:45.840
if the Army produces a left-threaded one

00:34:45.840 --> 00:34:46.559
then the Navy side

00:34:46.559 --> 00:34:48.079
must produce a right-threaded one

00:34:48.079 --> 00:34:49.599
to show they are different

00:34:50.639 --> 00:34:51.000
Yes

00:34:51.000 --> 00:34:52.679
You've probably heard about it back home too

00:34:53.480 --> 00:34:55.079
Now those guys in the Army are developing

00:34:55.079 --> 00:34:57.480
small naval vessels

00:34:57.480 --> 00:35:00.360
while my Navy arsenals

00:35:00.760 --> 00:35:02.320
are producing Army tanks out of spite

00:35:02.320 --> 00:35:03.079
Yes

00:35:03.280 --> 00:35:04.079
I have heard of that

00:35:06.519 --> 00:35:08.199
What is even more absurd is

00:35:08.199 --> 00:35:10.280
a general in our Navy

00:35:10.280 --> 00:35:13.519
wrote a book

00:35:13.519 --> 00:35:15.800
titled "The Bible of Cursing the Army"

00:35:16.559 --> 00:35:18.199
to be distributed to all fleets and bases

00:35:18.199 --> 00:35:19.480
Here

00:35:19.480 --> 00:35:20.079
I withheld it

00:35:20.079 --> 00:35:21.119
and did not distribute it

00:35:21.119 --> 00:35:21.719
Yes

00:35:21.719 --> 00:35:23.480
I have heard about this matter too

00:35:23.480 --> 00:35:24.639
It is indeed too absurd

00:35:27.920 --> 00:35:29.000
I am not

00:35:29.000 --> 00:35:30.559
stopping you from going to investigate Mt. Huangyang

00:35:31.039 --> 00:35:32.119
Worrying is one thing

00:35:32.119 --> 00:35:33.280
investigating is another

00:35:33.559 --> 00:35:34.119
Let's go together to see

00:35:34.119 --> 00:35:35.280
the terrain in that area

00:35:35.639 --> 00:35:36.239
This way

00:35:36.239 --> 00:35:36.920
Yes

00:35:44.719 --> 00:35:46.599
Master Geng

00:36:01.199 --> 00:36:02.719
These past couple of days...

00:36:02.719 --> 00:36:04.320
we lost two more brothers.

00:36:05.960 --> 00:36:07.519
It's keeping me up at night.

00:36:08.599 --> 00:36:10.280
So I called everyone here to discuss it.

00:36:11.280 --> 00:36:12.679
Brother Erhu...

00:36:12.679 --> 00:36:14.519
is just a loach in a ditch.

00:36:14.519 --> 00:36:15.760
He can't handle the open sea.

00:36:16.519 --> 00:36:17.840
He folded before even getting ashore.

00:36:17.840 --> 00:36:18.960
This leak in the operation...

00:36:18.960 --> 00:36:20.239
really shouldn't have happened.

00:36:22.480 --> 00:36:24.000
The Master is right here.

00:36:24.000 --> 00:36:24.920
Watch your mouth.

00:36:25.159 --> 00:36:25.960
Don't forget,

00:36:26.400 --> 00:36:28.280
Erhu and the others were your brothers too.

00:36:29.480 --> 00:36:30.280
Master Geng,

00:36:30.880 --> 00:36:32.480
I didn't mean anything by it.

00:36:40.000 --> 00:36:41.039
Recently,

00:36:41.599 --> 00:36:43.559
someone from the Nationalist government came.

00:36:46.159 --> 00:36:47.480
He wants to discuss

00:36:47.480 --> 00:36:49.239
working together against the Sanzao Island base

00:36:49.239 --> 00:36:50.719
and those Japanese over there.

00:36:53.519 --> 00:36:56.719
I was thinking of using this chance

00:36:57.199 --> 00:36:59.079
to get my brother's family

00:36:59.079 --> 00:37:00.480
off that island.

00:37:01.320 --> 00:37:02.559
With them staying there,

00:37:02.559 --> 00:37:04.280
I'm on edge all day long.

00:37:04.880 --> 00:37:06.400
I've got no appetite.

00:37:07.960 --> 00:37:08.760
Master Geng,

00:37:09.840 --> 00:37:11.400
that's a major undertaking.

00:37:12.480 --> 00:37:14.320
Since the 27th Year of the Republic,

00:37:14.679 --> 00:37:16.960
when the Japs occupied our island,

00:37:17.519 --> 00:37:18.840
they've kept it under tight watch.

00:37:19.679 --> 00:37:21.039
The patrol boats at sea

00:37:21.039 --> 00:37:22.280
have never stopped running.

00:37:22.840 --> 00:37:25.199
And there are sentries everywhere on shore.

00:37:26.840 --> 00:37:28.199
If we're not careful,

00:37:29.079 --> 00:37:31.880
and the old master's family can't get out,

00:37:32.519 --> 00:37:34.599
it might cause even more trouble.

00:37:35.639 --> 00:37:37.960
We should think this through carefully.

00:37:39.599 --> 00:37:40.599
Master Geng.

00:37:41.039 --> 00:37:41.760
So,

00:37:41.760 --> 00:37:44.280
that man from the Nationalist government,

00:37:44.280 --> 00:37:46.519
what can he do for us?

00:37:47.320 --> 00:37:48.960
They're from Military Intelligence.

00:37:49.920 --> 00:37:52.000
They have a lot of power on the mainland.

00:37:53.159 --> 00:37:55.000
Yuan Dai's 7th Advance Column in Zhongshan

00:37:55.000 --> 00:37:56.519
is under their command.

00:37:56.880 --> 00:37:57.679
Master Geng,

00:37:58.320 --> 00:37:59.559
I'll take the brothers

00:37:59.559 --> 00:38:01.119
and kidnap the Japanese Consul

00:38:01.119 --> 00:38:01.880
stationed in Macau.

00:38:02.199 --> 00:38:04.039
We'll make them send your brother's family

00:38:04.039 --> 00:38:05.079
to Macau for an exchange.

00:38:05.079 --> 00:38:05.920
Wouldn't that solve it?

00:38:05.920 --> 00:38:07.119
Haozi,

00:38:08.519 --> 00:38:10.599
I know you're loyal.

00:38:10.599 --> 00:38:11.760
But if you do that,

00:38:12.320 --> 00:38:14.079
you're bound to stir up trouble.

00:38:15.199 --> 00:38:16.079
We'll do whatever you say.

00:38:21.480 --> 00:38:22.760
All branches must treat this matter

00:38:22.760 --> 00:38:24.159
as a top priority.

00:38:24.679 --> 00:38:26.840
Tell the men to keep their ears open these days

00:38:27.719 --> 00:38:29.599
and find a good opportunity

00:38:30.360 --> 00:38:32.119
for us all to plan this out properly.

00:38:32.559 --> 00:38:35.079
Join forces with the Nationalists,

00:38:35.320 --> 00:38:36.800
finding a chance to handle this

00:38:36.800 --> 00:38:38.559
smoothly and securely.

00:38:38.920 --> 00:38:39.480
Yes, sir.

00:38:39.480 --> 00:38:40.559
Master Geng.

00:38:41.039 --> 00:38:42.920
This is Sanzao Island.

00:38:43.599 --> 00:38:45.039
You must follow Niwan

00:38:45.039 --> 00:38:47.480
and land at Dachikan.

00:38:47.800 --> 00:38:48.880
In that area, there are

00:38:48.880 --> 00:38:49.960
guerrillas of the Chiang regime

00:38:49.960 --> 00:38:52.760
and Communist guerrillas operating.

00:38:56.039 --> 00:38:57.960
Then I must go there no matter what.

00:38:57.960 --> 00:38:58.639
Otherwise, there is no way

00:38:58.639 --> 00:39:00.000
to answer to my superiors.

00:39:02.480 --> 00:39:03.840
If you insist on going,

00:39:03.840 --> 00:39:05.239
take more troops with you.

00:39:05.239 --> 00:39:07.239
We need to ensure your safety.

00:39:08.119 --> 00:39:10.360
If something happens to you,

00:39:10.400 --> 00:39:12.519
I won't be able to explain it to Dong Jing.

00:39:12.960 --> 00:39:13.559
Yes.

00:39:13.559 --> 00:39:14.719
Thank you, General.

00:39:16.159 --> 00:39:19.039
If you don't want to use the Police Battalion,

00:39:22.039 --> 00:39:24.039
you can draft two units from the Garrison

00:39:24.039 --> 00:39:26.760
and Construction Units.

00:39:27.280 --> 00:39:29.000
I'll notify the Patrol Boat Battalion

00:39:29.000 --> 00:39:30.840
to take you there.

00:39:31.000 --> 00:39:32.480
When do you plan to move out?

00:39:33.400 --> 00:39:34.920
I'll just take the Garrison Unit.

00:39:35.119 --> 00:39:36.519
If you agree,

00:39:36.519 --> 00:39:38.079
I'd like to set off this afternoon

00:39:38.079 --> 00:39:39.920
and withdraw before dark.

00:39:41.159 --> 00:39:43.119
That's too rushed.

00:39:43.880 --> 00:39:44.559
How about this.

00:39:44.559 --> 00:39:45.639
Move out tomorrow morning.

00:39:45.639 --> 00:39:47.880
Get everything ready today.

00:39:48.400 --> 00:39:49.199
I'll assign an officer

00:39:49.199 --> 00:39:50.400
to ensure your safety.

00:39:50.800 --> 00:39:51.840
Take a radio set

00:39:51.840 --> 00:39:53.039
and an operator.

00:39:53.679 --> 00:39:56.360
Go to the Base Hospital too

00:39:56.360 --> 00:39:56.960
and take a doctor with you.

00:39:56.960 --> 00:39:58.199
Bring enough medicine.

00:39:59.079 --> 00:40:00.119
As for the officer,

00:40:00.119 --> 00:40:01.719
let Captain Akino go again.

00:40:02.119 --> 00:40:03.800
Also, the radio

00:40:03.800 --> 00:40:05.480
and the operator are crucial.

00:40:06.320 --> 00:40:07.519
Before I go,

00:40:07.519 --> 00:40:08.480
I must report to Dong Jing

00:40:08.480 --> 00:40:10.159
about this operation.

00:40:12.679 --> 00:40:13.559
Sakamoto.

00:40:14.039 --> 00:40:14.920
Yes, sir.

00:40:16.519 --> 00:40:17.360
Your orders?

00:40:17.360 --> 00:40:19.000
Escort the Colonel to the Radio Room.

00:40:19.000 --> 00:40:20.519
Requisition a radio

00:40:20.519 --> 00:40:22.000
and an operator for the Colonel.

00:40:22.280 --> 00:40:23.119
Yes, sir.

00:40:26.159 --> 00:40:27.519
I'll have Sakamoto notify

00:40:27.519 --> 00:40:29.039
the Garrison Unit and Base Hospital

00:40:29.039 --> 00:40:29.639
to prepare the necessary

00:40:29.639 --> 00:40:30.960
personnel and supplies.

00:40:33.679 --> 00:40:35.079
Good luck with the mission.

00:40:36.480 --> 00:40:37.119
Yes, sir.

00:40:38.639 --> 00:40:39.920
Send it in plain text this time.

00:40:39.920 --> 00:40:40.599
Yes, sir.

00:41:07.920 --> 00:41:09.280
Intercepted Logger telegram

00:41:10.239 --> 00:41:11.280
Received Investigator telegram

00:41:25.760 --> 00:41:26.960
Investigation smooth

00:41:26.960 --> 00:41:27.920
Plan tomorrow

00:41:27.920 --> 00:41:29.840
at Huangyang Mountain crash site

00:41:29.840 --> 00:41:31.360
to conduct re-examination

00:41:31.760 --> 00:41:32.559
Special Report

00:41:32.559 --> 00:41:33.719
Takeki Ichiro

00:41:41.599 --> 00:41:42.480
Adjutant Sakamoto.

00:41:42.480 --> 00:41:42.960
Yes, sir.

00:41:42.960 --> 00:41:44.320
