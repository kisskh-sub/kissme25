WEBVTT

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:54.160
Say it. Say it.

00:01:55.080 --> 00:01:56.880
to leave the Chamber of Commerce

00:01:57.280 --> 00:02:00.240
to leave the Chamber of Commerce to benefit the people.

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:01.600
It's all a lie.

00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:04.360
She's also a phony.

00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:06.600
who likes vanity.

00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:09.240
My lord.

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:13.860
Did you drink? Yes.

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:17.960
Did you drink?

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:20.400
Just a drink.

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:21.520
It's okay

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:22.800
Debull, may I ask

00:02:22.960 --> 00:02:24.520
May I have a drink with you?

00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:27.320
My lord. (Support Admin Watch on
kissasia.cam or kisskh.org)

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:29.240
A man must keep his word.

00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:32.400
My lord promised to travel with Debuo.

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:34.079
I don't know if I can do it.

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:38.120
Are you waiting for your love?

00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:42.240
Okay.

00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:44.360
Let's drink together.

00:02:50.960 --> 00:02:52.820
I'm not in the government office.

00:02:53.800 --> 00:02:55.960
or the camp.

00:02:56.360 --> 00:02:57.600
There's no one at home.

00:02:57.600 --> 00:02:58.520
It's here.

00:02:58.520 --> 00:03:00.960
Where is Xu Ziqi?

00:03:08.480 --> 00:03:09.240
Come on.

00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:10.560
Cheers.

00:03:18.079 --> 00:03:18.840
Let's drink.

00:03:33.800 --> 00:03:35.660
Aren't you going after Ms. Zheng?

00:03:37.640 --> 00:03:38.970
Why would I go after her?

00:03:41.079 --> 00:03:42.480
The man she's looking for

00:03:43.800 --> 00:03:45.040
is not me.

00:04:00.400 --> 00:04:01.760
It's getting dark.

00:04:02.800 --> 00:04:05.060
It's not safe for you to be outside alone.

00:04:05.520 --> 00:04:06.560
Go home now.

00:04:20.120 --> 00:04:22.360
This is Deok-biao's first time drinking.

00:04:22.360 --> 00:04:24.560
It's said to boost courage by drinking.

00:04:26.200 --> 00:04:28.440
After drinking this wine today,

00:04:29.200 --> 00:04:30.860
I want to ask you one last time.

00:04:31.760 --> 00:04:32.760
As you know,

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:35.520
Deibiao has fallen for you for a long time.

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:38.360
So does Deibiao still have a chance?

00:04:39.320 --> 00:04:40.120
Depiao.

00:04:40.800 --> 00:04:42.440
You're a very nice girl.

00:04:44.320 --> 00:04:45.120
But

00:04:46.200 --> 00:04:47.730
I still love Hua Xiao Zheng.

00:04:48.440 --> 00:04:49.240
Although

00:04:49.680 --> 00:04:51.680
have different paths,

00:04:53.080 --> 00:04:53.880
But...

00:04:54.320 --> 00:04:54.880
I don't know

00:04:54.880 --> 00:04:56.760
when I can let her go.

00:04:57.640 --> 00:04:58.840
I can't give you hope.

00:04:59.520 --> 00:05:00.680
This is my rule.

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:02.060
Do you understand?

00:05:04.880 --> 00:05:06.280
Thank you for your words.

00:05:08.880 --> 00:05:09.560
Got it.

00:05:21.800 --> 00:05:22.400
By the way,

00:05:23.560 --> 00:05:24.680
But are you willing

00:05:25.320 --> 00:05:27.640
to bid farewell to Miss Xiao?

00:05:28.320 --> 00:05:30.580
Aren't you afraid of misunderstanding?

00:05:33.120 --> 00:05:34.650
What else do you have to say?

00:05:36.760 --> 00:05:38.360
Even if we break up,

00:05:39.120 --> 00:05:40.680
we should make it clear.

00:05:41.200 --> 00:05:44.000
Deok-Biao is willing

00:05:53.760 --> 00:05:54.320
Zheng.

00:05:55.760 --> 00:05:56.680
You're amazing.

00:05:56.680 --> 00:05:58.210
It's all thanks to everyone

00:05:58.560 --> 00:06:00.120
It's all thanks to everyone.

00:06:00.120 --> 00:06:01.200
We'll open soon.

00:06:02.640 --> 00:06:04.560
I'll get you a glass of water.

00:06:05.120 --> 00:06:06.200
Take a rest later.

00:06:10.360 --> 00:06:11.120
Ms. Zheng.

00:06:11.360 --> 00:06:12.200
Miss Xiao Zheng.

00:06:12.200 --> 00:06:13.120
Miss Yang.

00:06:13.520 --> 00:06:14.760
This is a very important letter.

00:06:14.760 --> 00:06:16.440
I have to give it to you myself.

00:06:17.320 --> 00:06:18.080
Well...

00:06:18.800 --> 00:06:21.240
Please put it on the counter.

00:06:21.240 --> 00:06:22.640
in my bag.

00:06:22.800 --> 00:06:25.080
I'm a little busy right now.

00:06:26.680 --> 00:06:27.440
Be careful.

00:06:29.800 --> 00:06:30.730
Hello, Mr. Bang.

00:06:36.200 --> 00:06:37.000
Higher on the left.

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:37.560
Right.

00:06:38.560 --> 00:06:39.560
Right?

00:06:40.120 --> 00:06:41.320
Remember to read it.

00:06:41.960 --> 00:06:43.240
Okay, don't worry.

00:06:43.440 --> 00:06:44.640
I'll get back to work.

00:06:46.560 --> 00:06:47.360
Right.

00:07:08.440 --> 00:07:09.120
Okay. Okay.

00:07:09.640 --> 00:07:10.200
OK.

00:07:30.120 --> 00:07:31.640
I think we can

00:07:31.640 --> 00:07:33.560
more new products.

00:07:34.680 --> 00:07:36.120
For example, brows,

00:07:36.200 --> 00:07:37.080
lipstick,

00:07:37.960 --> 00:07:38.760
Rouge.

00:07:39.120 --> 00:07:41.050
I think there are too few types now.

00:07:41.120 --> 00:07:41.760
Zheng.

00:07:42.760 --> 00:07:43.560
Your face

00:07:44.200 --> 00:07:45.130
black and dizzy.

00:07:45.680 --> 00:07:46.340
Where is it?

00:07:51.800 --> 00:07:53.130
I'll wipe it off for you.

00:08:05.680 --> 00:08:06.120
Done.

00:08:06.680 --> 00:08:07.000
It's clean.

00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:07.360
Okay.

00:08:12.200 --> 00:08:12.730
Let’s go.

00:08:19.320 --> 00:08:21.440
Yang Lin is very busy recently.

00:08:22.320 --> 00:08:24.980
He has no time to worry about the family affairs.

00:08:25.560 --> 00:08:26.560
Steward Yang.

00:08:27.320 --> 00:08:28.450
What is he busy with?

00:08:29.440 --> 00:08:31.440
He's busy preparing his dowry.

00:08:33.559 --> 00:08:34.440
dowry?

00:08:36.280 --> 00:08:37.280
Yang Lin told me

00:08:38.320 --> 00:08:41.799
De Biao and Brother Xu have been in pairs recently.

00:08:42.919 --> 00:08:44.480
When Xu was dismissed,

00:08:45.280 --> 00:08:47.920
he was comforting and encouraging by his side.

00:08:48.920 --> 00:08:51.200
So I want to find Brother Xu.

00:08:52.320 --> 00:08:53.980
and pick a date to get engaged.

00:08:57.440 --> 00:08:58.400
So soon?

00:09:00.440 --> 00:09:02.700
They've known each other for a long time.

00:09:03.160 --> 00:09:03.800
Maybe

00:09:05.560 --> 00:09:06.960
this is fate.

00:09:48.440 --> 00:09:50.680
Why is it snowing in autumn?

00:09:51.080 --> 00:09:53.920
The weather in Chang'an is so strange this year.

00:09:55.200 --> 00:09:55.920
Exactly.

00:09:55.920 --> 00:09:57.040
Have you heard that

00:09:57.840 --> 00:09:59.040
there is another

00:09:59.400 --> 00:10:01.460
The clear sky is splitting lightning

00:10:01.800 --> 00:10:02.960
A girl was struck.

00:10:03.480 --> 00:10:05.600
I wonder if she was killed.

00:10:05.960 --> 00:10:08.280
Look at so many strange things.

00:10:09.200 --> 00:10:11.280
Is there a demon?

00:10:58.800 --> 00:10:59.960
It suddenly snowed.

00:11:01.080 --> 00:11:02.400
So I came to see it.

00:11:03.680 --> 00:11:04.800
I told you

00:11:06.560 --> 00:11:07.680
the snow here

00:11:08.280 --> 00:11:09.540
is the most beautiful.

00:11:11.320 --> 00:11:12.280
You also said

00:11:13.080 --> 00:11:14.340
if it's the first snow,

00:11:15.320 --> 00:11:16.800
let's watch it here.

00:11:35.960 --> 00:11:37.020
About the flowers.

00:11:38.680 --> 00:11:39.440
I'm sorry.

00:11:41.160 --> 00:11:42.080
It's okay.

00:11:42.560 --> 00:11:45.080
We will find a way to solve it.

00:11:49.280 --> 00:11:50.560
You will.

00:11:52.400 --> 00:11:53.800
I always set you up.

00:11:54.440 --> 00:11:56.300
It's rare for you to trick me once.

00:11:58.320 --> 00:11:58.960
Yeah.

00:11:59.600 --> 00:12:01.530
How many times have you tricked me?

00:12:03.200 --> 00:12:04.680
You saw my body

00:12:05.080 --> 00:12:06.480
and ruined my innocence.

00:12:06.920 --> 00:12:09.080
I was demoted and punished.

00:12:09.280 --> 00:12:11.080
and got flogged dozens of times.

00:12:12.800 --> 00:12:15.280
and made money

00:12:15.480 --> 00:12:16.680
to make dirty money.

00:12:22.080 --> 00:12:23.320
Later I found out

00:12:23.800 --> 00:12:25.680
you stole milk milk tea

00:12:26.040 --> 00:12:27.640
you went to rob the cow alone.

00:12:29.160 --> 00:12:30.960
and hurt yourself.

00:12:32.680 --> 00:12:34.880
It's good that you won the competition.

00:12:35.720 --> 00:12:38.320
Then you fell out with the Chamber of Commerce.

00:12:38.600 --> 00:12:40.200
and quit being the Oiran.

00:12:42.040 --> 00:12:43.300
You did nothing wrong.

00:12:43.320 --> 00:12:45.720
You made the right choice.

00:13:21.160 --> 00:13:22.290
It's snowy and cold.

00:13:23.080 --> 00:13:24.010
Warm your hands.

00:13:36.600 --> 00:13:37.840
Think about it.

00:13:39.480 --> 00:13:41.540
We've been through so much together.

00:13:43.080 --> 00:13:43.920
Yeah.

00:13:45.560 --> 00:13:47.160
I also find it unbelievable.

00:13:47.800 --> 00:13:49.330
It's only been a few months,

00:13:49.800 --> 00:13:51.460
It's like a decade has passed.

00:14:05.080 --> 00:14:05.840
Xiao Zheng.

00:14:07.320 --> 00:14:08.280
From now on,

00:14:09.720 --> 00:14:11.400
in the future.

00:14:14.160 --> 00:14:14.960
Xu Ziqi.

00:14:16.320 --> 00:14:17.160
You too.

00:14:18.920 --> 00:14:20.160
Take care.

00:15:33.320 --> 00:15:34.600
Miss, what's wrong?

00:15:35.680 --> 00:15:37.320
Wei, go get a doctor.

00:16:06.200 --> 00:16:07.400
It's been three days.

00:16:08.320 --> 00:16:09.780
The fever is finally gone.

00:16:09.960 --> 00:16:12.440
He fainted after three days of fever.

00:16:13.040 --> 00:16:14.200
Three days.

00:16:14.800 --> 00:16:16.200
and cried for three days.

00:16:19.840 --> 00:16:20.680
Zheng.

00:16:33.320 --> 00:16:34.560
Where am I?

00:16:37.040 --> 00:16:37.960
Who am I?

00:16:38.320 --> 00:16:39.080
Zheng.

00:16:40.160 --> 00:16:42.160
Did you burn for three days?

00:16:43.080 --> 00:16:44.410
Are you out of your mind?

00:16:53.840 --> 00:16:54.680
Zheng.

00:16:56.440 --> 00:16:58.440
You and Xu Ziqi

00:17:10.960 --> 00:17:12.520
as a dream.

00:17:13.160 --> 00:17:14.490
I woke up for a long time.

00:17:14.760 --> 00:17:16.200
I'm still touched.

00:17:17.040 --> 00:17:19.119
I still want to be protected by you.

00:17:19.119 --> 00:17:20.440
The pain in my heart

00:17:21.760 --> 00:17:23.960
Don't worry. The world is big.

00:17:24.880 --> 00:17:26.760
But I remember what you said.

00:17:31.040 --> 00:17:31.960
What?

00:17:41.480 --> 00:17:42.840
Get up early

00:17:43.200 --> 00:17:44.480
Embracing the sun

00:17:44.680 --> 00:17:46.040
Make life

00:17:46.720 --> 00:17:48.120
full of positive energy.

00:17:48.440 --> 00:17:49.840
Full of positive energy.

00:17:56.600 --> 00:17:57.440
Guys.

00:17:57.720 --> 00:17:59.960
Let's work hard together.

00:18:00.920 --> 00:18:03.280
Work hard, humble, grateful

00:18:03.680 --> 00:18:05.640
Keep fighting for the dream.

00:18:05.960 --> 00:18:07.440
Come on! Come on!

00:18:19.920 --> 00:18:20.680
Xiao Zheng.

00:18:21.920 --> 00:18:24.360
We know Lord Xu

00:18:24.960 --> 00:18:26.760
will be very stimulating to you.

00:18:27.200 --> 00:18:28.400
Adjust for a few days.

00:18:28.920 --> 00:18:29.960
You don't have to act tough.

00:18:29.960 --> 00:18:32.160
Although I've been burning these days,

00:18:32.520 --> 00:18:33.760
my mind

00:18:33.920 --> 00:18:35.520
thinking about the shop.

00:18:35.880 --> 00:18:37.210
Haven't you been crying

00:18:37.520 --> 00:18:38.960
these days?

00:18:40.640 --> 00:18:41.900
The flowers are wrong.

00:18:42.440 --> 00:18:44.200
It's snowing now.

00:18:44.480 --> 00:18:45.600
we can't

00:18:45.600 --> 00:18:47.400
in a short time.

00:18:48.000 --> 00:18:49.120
The shop is open.

00:18:49.720 --> 00:18:51.180
and the signboard is gone.

00:18:51.400 --> 00:18:53.200
I can't just do nothing.

00:18:54.880 --> 00:18:55.680
So,

00:18:58.440 --> 00:19:01.200
I came up with a wonderful idea.

00:19:01.680 --> 00:19:02.960
It's shameless,

00:19:03.960 --> 00:19:06.480
but there must be a way to attract attention.

00:19:08.280 --> 00:19:09.440
What is it?

00:19:10.000 --> 00:19:11.160
Let's look for

00:19:11.200 --> 00:19:13.160
the hottest and popular shop.

00:19:13.440 --> 00:19:15.200
Try everything you can

00:19:16.040 --> 00:19:17.100
to blackmail them.

00:19:17.640 --> 00:19:19.440
Why does it sound like

00:19:20.360 --> 00:19:21.840
you'll be beaten to death?

00:19:21.840 --> 00:19:23.700
It's okay. She'll take the punch.

00:19:23.920 --> 00:19:25.760
It does sound feasible.

00:19:27.880 --> 00:19:29.200
I took a few days off.

00:19:29.400 --> 00:19:30.360
You don't know

00:19:32.120 --> 00:19:35.680
my passion of work

00:19:37.200 --> 00:19:39.480
is about to drown me.

00:19:45.440 --> 00:19:46.640
It's been a long time.

00:19:46.720 --> 00:19:47.920
It's not our turn yet.

00:19:48.120 --> 00:19:48.680
Yeah.

00:19:50.760 --> 00:19:51.360
Excuse me.

00:19:52.680 --> 00:19:53.400
Move!

00:19:53.520 --> 00:19:54.160
Excuse me.

00:19:54.240 --> 00:19:55.480
What's wrong with him?

00:19:55.480 --> 00:19:55.880
Cut the queue.

00:19:55.880 --> 00:19:56.400
Boss.

00:19:56.880 --> 00:19:59.200
Make the most popular product

00:19:59.440 --> 00:20:00.360
one by one.

00:20:00.640 --> 00:20:01.640
OK, wait a moment.

00:20:04.440 --> 00:20:05.280
Fascinating.

00:20:05.680 --> 00:20:07.880
Look at this. Look at this. Look at this.

00:20:10.040 --> 00:20:10.880
That's all.

00:20:11.600 --> 00:20:12.400
It's here.

00:20:23.200 --> 00:20:24.860
What do you think of the color?

00:20:28.680 --> 00:20:29.880
Ji’s Ran Workshop.

00:20:29.960 --> 00:20:32.680
The top three cosmetics shops in the west market

00:20:33.360 --> 00:20:35.720
The annual dyed armor sales are the best in Chang'an.

00:20:35.720 --> 00:20:37.840
It has always been colourful.

00:20:38.040 --> 00:20:40.480
The ingredients are natural as the foundation of my career.

00:20:40.480 --> 00:20:41.440
Seeing you today,

00:20:41.440 --> 00:20:43.960
I've heard so much about you.

00:20:46.840 --> 00:20:47.970
What does this mean?

00:20:50.200 --> 00:20:50.400
This...

00:20:50.400 --> 00:20:52.680
It's just natural.

00:20:53.520 --> 00:20:56.520
Do you have some misunderstanding about pure nature?

00:20:56.680 --> 00:20:57.440
Smell it.

00:20:58.120 --> 00:20:59.520
The smell of the medicine

00:21:00.680 --> 00:21:02.280
Is this the scent of flowers?

00:21:02.360 --> 00:21:03.920
Can I vaguely smell

00:21:04.160 --> 00:21:05.560
of low quality cinnabar?

00:21:05.880 --> 00:21:07.960
is the fragrance of mud.

00:21:10.280 --> 00:21:13.000
Ji said flowers come from the soil.

00:21:13.200 --> 00:21:14.840
So it smells like mud.

00:21:15.360 --> 00:21:16.690
But this is the problem.

00:21:16.920 --> 00:21:19.760
Didn't your family clean the soil

00:21:20.160 --> 00:21:21.720
before making the soil?

00:21:21.720 --> 00:21:22.120
Well...

00:21:22.120 --> 00:21:23.240
There's only one reason.

00:21:23.240 --> 00:21:25.960
This is not a natural flower dyeing armor.

00:21:26.600 --> 00:21:29.360
It contains a lot of low quality cinnabar.

00:21:29.440 --> 00:21:32.500
That’s why you can leave color on your nails for so long.

00:21:32.760 --> 00:21:34.640
You all know cinnabar, right?

00:21:35.040 --> 00:21:36.960
You’ll die if you eat too much.

00:21:37.680 --> 00:21:39.920
Ji, are you serious?

00:21:40.160 --> 00:21:41.640
To make such a product?

00:21:41.640 --> 00:21:43.000
You...

00:21:43.000 --> 00:21:44.000
Stop talking nonsense.

00:21:44.000 --> 00:21:44.640
Let me tell you.

00:21:44.640 --> 00:21:45.770
Don't listen to her.

00:21:46.000 --> 00:21:47.720
I don't even know where she came from.

00:21:47.720 --> 00:21:49.680
Nonsense.

00:21:51.680 --> 00:21:53.280
Don't believe her!

00:21:53.280 --> 00:21:54.160
Don't trust her.

00:21:54.160 --> 00:21:56.120
Trust me. Trust me.

00:21:56.440 --> 00:21:58.240
Move.

00:22:01.720 --> 00:22:03.180
Excuse me. Stop fighting.

00:22:05.440 --> 00:22:06.360
Stop!

00:22:08.360 --> 00:22:09.880
Stop! Stop!

00:22:11.440 --> 00:22:12.360
Stop it!

00:22:15.200 --> 00:22:16.260
Alright, let's go.

00:22:16.520 --> 00:22:17.400
Back off.

00:22:22.000 --> 00:22:24.200
Didn't you have a fever for several days?

00:22:24.200 --> 00:22:26.400
How could you come out and make trouble?

00:22:26.440 --> 00:22:28.440
I've been lying in bed for a few days.

00:22:28.440 --> 00:22:29.200
I'm fine.

00:22:30.760 --> 00:22:32.420
Didn't you just lose your job?

00:22:33.360 --> 00:22:36.240
Why did you come out to torture people so soon?

00:22:37.960 --> 00:22:39.490
It's none of your business.

00:22:39.960 --> 00:22:41.960
Come with me to the government office.

00:22:41.960 --> 00:22:43.290
I'm not making trouble.

00:22:43.480 --> 00:22:45.280
They are selling counterfeits.

00:22:45.720 --> 00:22:47.450
I'm trying to reason with them.

00:22:48.440 --> 00:22:50.300
You want to bring me to the police?

00:22:50.360 --> 00:22:52.280
Guess who will go to jail

00:22:52.440 --> 00:22:53.640
was me or them?

00:22:53.640 --> 00:22:54.100
It's me.

00:22:55.000 --> 00:22:57.280
It's just a small matter. I'll do it. I'll do it. I'll do it.

00:22:57.280 --> 00:22:59.160
I won't report it to the government.

00:22:59.160 --> 00:23:00.600
Sorry to trouble you.

00:23:02.640 --> 00:23:04.000
You found a new job.

00:23:04.240 --> 00:23:05.600
Then make more money.

00:23:05.840 --> 00:23:06.880
Don't live a tight life

00:23:06.880 --> 00:23:08.720
and have a baby.

00:23:09.520 --> 00:23:11.360
You're so rude.

00:23:11.360 --> 00:23:12.960
Can't you just hope I'm good?

00:23:13.160 --> 00:23:14.090
After we go home,

00:23:14.400 --> 00:23:16.880
make some lotus seed soup to cool down.

00:23:18.200 --> 00:23:20.200
Remember to take care of the lotus seeds.

00:23:20.200 --> 00:23:22.520
Add some goji berries to warm it up.

00:23:23.120 --> 00:23:24.200
Eat more sweet food

00:23:24.200 --> 00:23:26.260
so that your mouth won't sound so bad.

00:23:28.040 --> 00:23:29.640
What do you think you are?

00:23:29.960 --> 00:23:31.420
Just because you're good,

00:23:31.720 --> 00:23:33.680
You always take people on the street.

00:23:33.680 --> 00:23:34.720
Your clothes and pants

00:23:34.720 --> 00:23:36.680
step on the corner and walk smoothly.

00:23:36.680 --> 00:23:38.480
Don't fall on him

00:23:38.480 --> 00:23:39.680
and fall on him.

00:23:40.440 --> 00:23:42.240
Can you afford it if it's broken?

00:23:43.040 --> 00:23:43.520
I...

00:23:45.000 --> 00:23:46.060
Let's go. Let's go.

00:23:49.400 --> 00:23:50.200
Let's go.

00:23:51.920 --> 00:23:52.720
Don't go.

00:23:59.760 --> 00:24:00.640
What are you doing?

00:24:00.640 --> 00:24:02.120
To maintain world peace.

00:24:02.400 --> 00:24:03.530
For love and justice

00:24:03.640 --> 00:24:05.640
I come to East and West City every day.

00:24:05.640 --> 00:24:06.600
A bully.

00:24:06.920 --> 00:24:09.440
Don't stop me.

00:24:09.480 --> 00:24:11.040
Every morning at 9 a.m.

00:24:11.680 --> 00:24:12.610
What time was it?

00:24:12.960 --> 00:24:13.840
When?

00:24:14.280 --> 00:24:15.080
Chen o'clock,

00:24:15.240 --> 00:24:16.840
I will come to challenge you.

00:24:16.880 --> 00:24:18.680
Don't stop me.

00:24:18.880 --> 00:24:20.960
As the captain of the security team,

00:24:20.960 --> 00:24:22.240
it’s my duty to

00:24:22.240 --> 00:24:23.440
is my duty.

00:24:23.840 --> 00:24:25.440
I won't let you go!

00:24:26.200 --> 00:24:29.120
Let's fight to the death!

00:24:29.160 --> 00:24:29.920
Sure.

00:24:29.920 --> 00:24:31.440
Let's fight to the death.

00:24:32.680 --> 00:24:34.960
But I have to go on patrol at seven.

00:24:34.960 --> 00:24:36.090
How about 9 o'clock?

00:24:36.280 --> 00:24:37.360
Follow your time.

00:24:37.600 --> 00:24:39.400
I'll come back after breakfast.

00:24:40.240 --> 00:24:41.300
Let's wait and see.

00:24:41.520 --> 00:24:42.440
You scoundrel.

00:24:42.760 --> 00:24:43.720
Just you wait.

00:24:43.960 --> 00:24:44.920
You bad guy!

00:25:36.160 --> 00:25:37.290
Where are you going?

00:25:37.680 --> 00:25:38.440
Stop!

00:25:39.360 --> 00:25:40.400
Stop!

00:25:43.680 --> 00:25:44.880
You still want to run?

00:25:45.000 --> 00:25:47.600
Do you know selling fake wine will kill people?

00:25:47.840 --> 00:25:49.440
Unscrupulous businessman.

00:25:49.600 --> 00:25:51.280
How much did you get from selling fake liquor?

00:25:51.280 --> 00:25:52.160
That's right.

00:25:55.520 --> 00:25:56.580
You're heartless.

00:26:00.680 --> 00:26:01.280
Unscrupulous!

00:26:01.280 --> 00:26:01.920
Come out!

00:26:06.720 --> 00:26:09.400
You're in our way, aren't you?

00:26:17.200 --> 00:26:18.760
Sisters, go!

00:26:24.640 --> 00:26:26.520
We can't do this business at all.

00:26:26.760 --> 00:26:28.760
The customers need to return them

00:26:29.160 --> 00:26:31.880
That's right. We've lost all the money.

00:26:32.200 --> 00:26:33.760
We can't afford it.

00:26:34.120 --> 00:26:35.120
He smashed the shop when he came.

00:26:35.120 --> 00:26:37.180
He moved all the valuable things away

00:26:38.400 --> 00:26:39.680
and beat him up.

00:26:39.760 --> 00:26:40.840
The security team

00:26:41.040 --> 00:26:42.720
is just a planner.

00:26:42.840 --> 00:26:44.600
He doesn't dare to be cruel every time.

00:26:44.600 --> 00:26:47.400
He didn't dare to take Hua Xiao Zheng to the police.

00:26:47.440 --> 00:26:47.970
Exactly.

00:26:48.200 --> 00:26:50.460
Why can't we report it to the government?

00:26:51.960 --> 00:26:54.200
It's all because of you.

00:26:54.720 --> 00:26:56.120
If you see the officials,

00:26:56.440 --> 00:26:58.100
Everyone has to go in and squat

00:26:58.200 --> 00:26:59.160
At this time,

00:26:59.160 --> 00:27:01.160
you can't just stand and talk.

00:27:01.920 --> 00:27:03.160
We businessmen

00:27:03.280 --> 00:27:05.680
pay so much money to the Chamber of Commerce every year.

00:27:05.680 --> 00:27:06.760
This is a big deal.

00:27:07.200 --> 00:27:08.840
You can't let us

00:27:08.840 --> 00:27:10.200
find the reason

00:27:10.280 --> 00:27:11.480
to solve the problem.

00:27:16.400 --> 00:27:18.400
I'll take care of this.

00:27:18.720 --> 00:27:20.960
I'll take care of Hua Xiaochi.

00:27:21.880 --> 00:27:25.200
But after I'm done, the East and West City is peaceful,

00:27:26.200 --> 00:27:29.400
Guess if you can still work here.

00:27:33.440 --> 00:27:35.240
Elder Yi and some elders.

00:27:35.400 --> 00:27:38.400
I offended you on impulse.

00:27:39.720 --> 00:27:41.680
Please forgive me.

00:27:42.280 --> 00:27:44.280
Don’t worry. I’ll pay you

00:27:44.480 --> 00:27:46.680
I'll pay you double this year.

00:27:46.960 --> 00:27:47.360
Double. Double.

00:27:47.360 --> 00:27:48.120
Double. Double.

00:27:48.120 --> 00:27:48.680
Double.

00:27:48.680 --> 00:27:49.440
Get out.

00:27:50.000 --> 00:27:51.960
I've made my attitude clear.

00:27:52.520 --> 00:27:53.920
standing here one by one.

00:27:54.200 --> 00:27:55.530
Are you demonstrating?

00:27:56.640 --> 00:27:57.000
No, no, no.

00:27:57.000 --> 00:27:57.680
I dare not.

00:27:58.280 --> 00:27:58.920
Let's go.

00:27:59.000 --> 00:27:59.840
Hurry up.

00:28:04.640 --> 00:28:05.640
Separate hatred.

00:28:13.720 --> 00:28:16.840
Have you signed the shop and contract?

00:28:17.120 --> 00:28:17.960
Yes.

00:28:18.600 --> 00:28:20.680
Okay, let her be.

00:28:21.200 --> 00:28:22.240
It's time.

00:28:22.440 --> 00:28:24.040
Let's go to the bottom. Okay.

00:28:25.480 --> 00:28:26.760
Yes, sir. Yes, sir. Yes, sir.

00:28:26.760 --> 00:28:27.360
Remember,

00:28:27.680 --> 00:28:31.440
You have to act well before the last step.

00:28:31.880 --> 00:28:33.480
Don't make her suspicious.

00:28:34.240 --> 00:28:35.040
Yes, sir. Yes, sir. Yes, sir. Yes, sir. Yes, sir. Yes, sir.

00:28:35.040 --> 00:28:35.570
Yes, sir.

00:28:46.920 --> 00:28:49.400
Do you know

00:28:49.400 --> 00:28:50.640
is now?

00:28:51.440 --> 00:28:52.960
Xu Ziqi.

00:28:53.600 --> 00:28:56.120
They are lovey-dovey together every day.

00:28:56.520 --> 00:28:57.720
This room is full of hatred.

00:28:57.720 --> 00:29:00.040
is still thinking about Hua Xiaochi.

00:29:07.040 --> 00:29:09.240
Chairman Bang heard what the elders said

00:29:09.240 --> 00:29:10.440
and left in a hurry.

00:29:11.040 --> 00:29:11.900
Let's go. Okay.

00:29:12.040 --> 00:29:12.480
Yes.

00:29:16.920 --> 00:29:17.980
Let's go! Let's go!

00:29:18.200 --> 00:29:18.960
Next,

00:29:19.600 --> 00:29:22.920
we should eliminate these ants and insects.

00:29:27.360 --> 00:29:28.280
Here, Jin'er.

00:29:29.200 --> 00:29:29.760
Zheng.

00:29:38.680 --> 00:29:38.960
What?

00:29:38.960 --> 00:29:40.440
Are you still seeing Xu Ziqi?

00:29:40.440 --> 00:29:41.840
We meet every day, right?

00:29:41.960 --> 00:29:44.920
Didn't he find a new job in East and West City?

00:29:45.640 --> 00:29:46.520
We just met.

00:29:46.520 --> 00:29:47.280
Did we meet

00:29:47.760 --> 00:29:49.220
or did you do it on purpose?

00:29:50.040 --> 00:29:50.970
Separate hatred

00:29:51.520 --> 00:29:54.360
Whether it's a coincidence or intentional,

00:29:54.480 --> 00:29:56.080
it has nothing to do with you.

00:29:56.600 --> 00:29:58.530
Then why do you make such a big noise

00:29:58.600 --> 00:29:59.960
in the Western Market every day?

00:29:59.960 --> 00:30:00.840
Why?

00:30:01.360 --> 00:30:03.440
I'm trying to destroy a fake product.

00:30:04.200 --> 00:30:04.960
Let go of me!

00:30:04.960 --> 00:30:05.960
You hurt me.

00:30:06.360 --> 00:30:08.600
I give you money from the shop,

00:30:08.760 --> 00:30:10.960
not to trouble the Chamber of Commerce.

00:30:10.960 --> 00:30:13.690
but also get involved with Xu Ziqi behind my back.

00:30:16.840 --> 00:30:18.720
I made it clear that day.

00:30:19.160 --> 00:30:21.720
I didn't take your shop and money for nothing.

00:30:21.720 --> 00:30:22.720
I'll pay you back.

00:30:22.960 --> 00:30:23.960
You were there too.

00:30:23.960 --> 00:30:25.290
You can testify, right?

00:30:28.120 --> 00:30:29.120
Separate hatred.

00:30:29.120 --> 00:30:31.960
I don't want to quarrel with you for three days.

00:30:32.160 --> 00:30:33.600
and quarrel with you every two days.

00:30:33.600 --> 00:30:35.480
Didn't you support me to start my own business?

00:30:35.480 --> 00:30:37.280
I still have a lot of things to do.

00:30:37.600 --> 00:30:40.260
I can't be distracted by these things every day.

00:30:41.680 --> 00:30:43.140
What else do you want to do?

00:30:43.400 --> 00:30:44.720
to meet Xu Ziqi?

00:30:45.640 --> 00:30:47.640
He's getting engaged to Yang Debiao.

00:30:47.640 --> 00:30:49.360
Why are you still entangled with him?

00:30:49.360 --> 00:30:50.600
Have you no shame?

00:30:55.680 --> 00:30:57.880
My love for you

00:30:58.600 --> 00:30:59.660
has never changed.

00:30:59.880 --> 00:31:01.280
Xu Ziqi doesn't love you.

00:31:02.200 --> 00:31:03.680
Stay with me.

00:31:04.040 --> 00:31:05.680
Let's work hard together.

00:31:06.040 --> 00:31:08.200
and do what you want.

00:31:08.680 --> 00:31:09.640
One more thing.

00:31:10.400 --> 00:31:11.920
You are still a member of the Chamber of Commerce.

00:31:11.920 --> 00:31:13.000
Those sellers in the West Market

00:31:13.000 --> 00:31:14.640
are also from the Chamber of Commerce.

00:31:14.640 --> 00:31:15.360
How can you do this?

00:31:15.360 --> 00:31:16.560
give others a way out?

00:31:16.600 --> 00:31:18.660
What will the Chamber of Commerce do?

00:31:19.120 --> 00:31:21.000
And this store is the Chamber of Commerce’s territory.

00:31:21.000 --> 00:31:23.060
I'll pay you back as soon as possible.

00:31:24.200 --> 00:31:25.130
What do you mean?

00:31:26.120 --> 00:31:28.360
I said I'll be quick.

00:31:28.680 --> 00:31:30.680
as soon as possible.

00:31:31.040 --> 00:31:33.600
I'll pay you back in seven days.

00:31:33.880 --> 00:31:35.720
One more thing.

00:31:36.120 --> 00:31:38.280
I have announced the breakdown with the Chamber of Commerce.

00:31:38.280 --> 00:31:39.960
I won't make a big deal out of this.

00:31:39.960 --> 00:31:41.920
Because you are still in the Chamber of Commerce.

00:31:41.920 --> 00:31:44.250
I don't want everyone in Chang'an to know.

00:31:44.440 --> 00:31:45.640
It's not good for you.

00:31:46.640 --> 00:31:47.440
Zheng.

00:31:48.160 --> 00:31:49.200
You're too naive.

00:31:49.880 --> 00:31:51.140
You're a merchant now.

00:31:51.440 --> 00:31:53.040
you will be controlled by the Chamber of Commerce.

00:31:53.040 --> 00:31:55.360
You can't defeat the Chamber of Commerce.

00:31:55.360 --> 00:31:57.360
Why don't we find a way to reconcile

00:31:57.840 --> 00:32:00.040
before the announcement is announced.

00:32:01.600 --> 00:32:02.400
Leave.

00:32:22.400 --> 00:32:25.720
The Chamber of Commerce must pay back the money.

00:32:26.040 --> 00:32:28.520
But where can we get so much money?

00:32:53.200 --> 00:32:55.040
They're talking big.

00:32:55.960 --> 00:32:58.200
What should we do with these flowers?

00:32:59.720 --> 00:33:01.040
It's so white.

00:33:04.040 --> 00:33:05.920
My head hurts.

00:33:11.240 --> 00:33:11.920
No.

00:33:19.680 --> 00:33:24.680
Snow White!

00:33:25.920 --> 00:33:28.200
Snow White!

00:33:28.960 --> 00:33:31.360
White white.

00:33:32.360 --> 00:33:33.760
Let's take a look.

00:33:34.160 --> 00:33:36.680
Which one is bigger?

00:33:42.040 --> 00:33:44.640
Two are the same size.

00:33:45.680 --> 00:33:46.680
Just white.

00:33:46.760 --> 00:33:49.880
It can make people amplify.

00:33:50.280 --> 00:33:52.400
So you think your faces

00:33:52.400 --> 00:33:53.730
not big or round enough.

00:33:53.960 --> 00:33:55.480
Don't miss it.

00:33:55.480 --> 00:33:56.960
The newly launched

00:33:57.160 --> 00:33:59.440
Pure cosmetics.

00:34:00.960 --> 00:34:01.280
This...

00:34:01.280 --> 00:34:02.120
What is this?

00:34:02.120 --> 00:34:03.920
What kind of new product is this?

00:34:04.760 --> 00:34:06.360
Our pink

00:34:06.360 --> 00:34:08.040
is pearl powder.

00:34:08.400 --> 00:34:10.000
instead of toxic meteorite.

00:34:10.159 --> 00:34:13.040
and the white petals that have never been polluted.

00:34:13.920 --> 00:34:16.560
Now let's see the color effect.

00:34:16.880 --> 00:34:19.719
Let's welcome our model and makeup artist.

00:34:20.840 --> 00:34:22.960
Okay.

00:34:25.239 --> 00:34:27.360
Jin'er's face is goose face.

00:34:27.600 --> 00:34:29.199
Although the lines are soft,

00:34:29.360 --> 00:34:30.560
but not round enough.

00:34:31.159 --> 00:34:32.219
Girls, attention.

00:34:33.840 --> 00:34:37.040
Apply the white evenly on her cheekbone

00:34:37.320 --> 00:34:39.440
and the edge of her chin.

00:34:39.440 --> 00:34:40.960
Then dye it.

00:34:41.719 --> 00:34:42.920
Let's see the effect.

00:34:43.040 --> 00:34:45.360
Is it round in an instant?

00:34:45.760 --> 00:34:46.960
So round.

00:34:47.000 --> 00:34:47.840
It's really round.

00:34:47.840 --> 00:34:48.600
It's really round.

00:34:48.600 --> 00:34:49.159
Yes

00:34:50.159 --> 00:34:51.040
It's round.

00:34:51.159 --> 00:34:53.080
You can't see the fans.

00:34:53.280 --> 00:34:54.120
No flour.

00:34:54.120 --> 00:34:57.160
It looks like my face is always round.

00:34:58.920 --> 00:34:59.240
Yes.

00:35:00.520 --> 00:35:02.640
Our first makeup product

00:35:02.640 --> 00:35:04.040
The white declaration is

00:35:04.480 --> 00:35:06.120
I'm always round.

00:35:06.400 --> 00:35:08.400
Let's have a round round round

00:35:08.640 --> 00:35:09.640
The tender round.

00:35:09.880 --> 00:35:10.920
Round round.

00:35:11.160 --> 00:35:12.800
It's a big sale today.

00:35:12.960 --> 00:35:14.640
Buy two pieces. 10% off.

00:35:14.640 --> 00:35:15.960
20% off if you buy three.

00:35:15.960 --> 00:35:18.280
Buy five and get one free.

00:35:18.520 --> 00:35:20.520
If you want to buy it, come and buy it.

00:35:23.360 --> 00:35:24.800
Everyone has it.

00:35:48.320 --> 00:35:49.120
What's wrong?

00:35:51.960 --> 00:35:52.440
Look.

00:35:52.600 --> 00:35:53.800
Here we go. Here we go.

00:35:53.960 --> 00:35:55.640
We don't have enough goods, right?

00:35:55.640 --> 00:35:56.720
We need replenishment. We need replenishment.

00:35:56.720 --> 00:35:57.240
OK. OK.

00:35:57.320 --> 00:35:57.980
Take a look.

00:36:00.600 --> 00:36:02.960
Hua Xiao Zheng, the beauty of the Chamber of Commerce Award.

00:36:02.960 --> 00:36:04.020
Start the new shop!

00:36:04.520 --> 00:36:05.560
Be successful!

00:36:06.040 --> 00:36:07.880
and benefit the people.

00:36:08.840 --> 00:36:10.880
Each of the four Elders

00:36:11.240 --> 00:36:12.760
to write this plaque.

00:36:13.040 --> 00:36:14.040
to Hua Xiaochi.

00:36:16.640 --> 00:36:18.040
90 yuan.

00:36:20.960 --> 00:36:22.360
Fifty cents, please.

00:36:24.880 --> 00:36:25.640
Xiao Zheng.

00:36:26.360 --> 00:36:27.400
Take this plaque.

00:36:28.160 --> 00:36:29.560
You won the first battle.

00:36:29.640 --> 00:36:31.160
The four Elders are pleased

00:36:31.160 --> 00:36:33.320
They are willing to give you

00:36:33.320 --> 00:36:33.960
for free.

00:36:34.880 --> 00:36:37.140
I will support your business from now on.

00:36:37.520 --> 00:36:38.560
And even taxes

00:36:38.760 --> 00:36:40.220
will give a high discount.

00:36:48.040 --> 00:36:51.640
A genius from the Chamber of Commerce.

00:36:55.440 --> 00:36:56.500
What are you doing?

00:37:03.360 --> 00:37:04.760
Are you trying to embarrass me in public?

00:37:04.760 --> 00:37:05.720
in public?

00:37:05.760 --> 00:37:07.040
You pushed me first.

00:37:07.520 --> 00:37:09.280
You always push me forward.

00:37:10.440 --> 00:37:11.800
Are you threatening me?

00:37:14.080 --> 00:37:14.920
All right.

00:37:15.880 --> 00:37:17.560
Go. Go.

00:37:19.520 --> 00:37:20.360
Don't go.

00:37:22.800 --> 00:37:24.520
Since this has happened,

00:37:24.840 --> 00:37:26.560
let's make it clear.

00:37:30.600 --> 00:37:31.520
Xu Ziqi.

00:37:42.960 --> 00:37:43.800
Li!

00:37:44.400 --> 00:37:45.930
Don't embarrass everyone.

00:37:45.960 --> 00:37:46.760
At this point,

00:37:46.960 --> 00:37:49.290
why don't we just do what Xiao Zheng wants?

00:37:49.920 --> 00:37:51.240
You really chose her.

00:37:52.240 --> 00:37:53.080
For her,

00:37:53.440 --> 00:37:55.400
for her.

00:37:56.480 --> 00:37:57.960
I didn't choose her.

00:37:58.400 --> 00:38:00.930
I chose to fight with the Chamber of Commerce.

00:38:01.120 --> 00:38:02.120
For so many years,

00:38:02.120 --> 00:38:03.160
how many times have I persuaded you?

00:38:03.160 --> 00:38:04.240
Have you ever heard

00:38:04.440 --> 00:38:06.500
Don't you understand my difficulty?

00:38:06.520 --> 00:38:07.580
Don't use your love

00:38:07.800 --> 00:38:09.280
as an excuse.

00:38:09.640 --> 00:38:11.160
You like Hua Xiaochi.

00:38:13.160 --> 00:38:14.640
I do.

00:38:14.960 --> 00:38:16.440
but I want to protect you too.

00:38:16.440 --> 00:38:17.840
I don't want to hear that.

00:38:18.280 --> 00:38:19.840
During the Oiran Competition,

00:38:19.840 --> 00:38:21.240
you supported Hua Xiaochi

00:38:21.240 --> 00:38:23.370
It's hard for me to stand in the middle.

00:38:23.560 --> 00:38:25.440
Did you ever think about my situation

00:38:25.440 --> 00:38:27.560
have you ever thought about my situation?

00:38:27.560 --> 00:38:28.890
You support Hua Xiaochi

00:38:29.240 --> 00:38:31.000
against the Chamber of Commerce.

00:38:31.000 --> 00:38:33.400
Do you know how much I suffered?

00:38:35.840 --> 00:38:37.170
Brotherhood for years.

00:38:37.520 --> 00:38:38.600
and life and death.

00:38:39.720 --> 00:38:40.960
For a woman,

00:38:41.120 --> 00:38:42.280
for a woman?

00:38:43.080 --> 00:38:44.000
[I once...]

00:38:45.520 --> 00:38:46.440
I once

00:38:47.080 --> 00:38:48.320
to protect you.

00:38:48.560 --> 00:38:49.960
to protect you.

00:38:50.320 --> 00:38:51.360
Even now.

00:38:52.160 --> 00:38:53.360
But you have to know

00:38:54.160 --> 00:38:55.960
I've been dismissed.

00:38:56.800 --> 00:38:57.960
I'm not that capable

00:38:57.960 --> 00:38:59.240
to protect you.

00:38:59.880 --> 00:39:02.010
You need to learn to protect yourself.

00:39:02.480 --> 00:39:04.340
I don't need anyone to protect me.

00:39:06.440 --> 00:39:07.770
Whoever goes against me

00:39:08.440 --> 00:39:09.520
is my enemy.

00:39:10.600 --> 00:39:12.080
You want to be my enemy?

00:39:13.280 --> 00:39:13.840
Li,

00:39:15.400 --> 00:39:17.560
When did you become so extreme?

00:39:20.440 --> 00:39:21.440
I have something

00:39:22.000 --> 00:39:23.560
I have to explain to you.

00:39:24.440 --> 00:39:25.440
I

00:39:25.840 --> 00:39:28.440
have completely left the Chamber of Commerce.

00:39:28.720 --> 00:39:30.440
All my business behaviors

00:39:30.600 --> 00:39:33.120
has nothing to do with the Chamber of Commerce.

00:39:33.120 --> 00:39:35.920
I'm no longer the Oiran of the Chamber of Commerce.

00:39:35.960 --> 00:39:38.840
From now on, I'm just Hua Xiaochi.

00:39:39.240 --> 00:39:40.760
I'm a businessman.

00:39:42.240 --> 00:39:43.000
Hua Xiaotong

00:39:49.800 --> 00:39:50.560
Separation.

00:39:51.400 --> 00:39:53.160
The rent you paid for the shop

00:39:53.520 --> 00:39:54.880
and the money you lent me

00:39:55.280 --> 00:39:56.960
I'll pay you back today.

00:40:09.480 --> 00:40:10.540
I've paid you back.

00:40:10.640 --> 00:40:11.480
From now on,

00:40:11.480 --> 00:40:13.600
will be my independent brand.

00:40:14.360 --> 00:40:16.440
My partner, Gu Jin'er.

00:40:16.600 --> 00:40:18.360
Hero, Zhang Gui Cai.

00:40:18.960 --> 00:40:21.560
has nothing to do with the Chamber of Commerce.

00:40:27.640 --> 00:40:28.560
You are right.

00:40:29.720 --> 00:40:32.280
You will break off with the Chamber of Commerce eventually.

00:40:32.280 --> 00:40:33.280
Break up with me?

00:40:34.400 --> 00:40:35.160
Yes.

00:40:35.520 --> 00:40:37.040
I want to

00:40:37.040 --> 00:40:39.440
with you forever.

00:40:48.920 --> 00:40:50.580
When you signed the contract,

00:40:50.840 --> 00:40:53.320
you didn't see the right I earned for you.

00:40:54.160 --> 00:40:56.160
The contract says

00:40:56.600 --> 00:40:58.840
the Chamber of Commerce has greater power

00:40:58.840 --> 00:41:00.520
and the decision-making rights

00:41:00.520 --> 00:41:03.000
in exchange for the support from the Chamber of Commerce

00:41:03.000 --> 00:41:03.840
and the store.

00:41:04.760 --> 00:41:06.000
If you break the contract,

00:41:06.000 --> 00:41:07.860
you must pay 10,000 taels of gold.

00:41:10.000 --> 00:41:11.840
or give your brand

00:41:12.440 --> 00:41:13.970
to the Chamber of Commerce.

00:41:20.320 --> 00:41:21.080
Xiao Zheng.

00:41:33.360 --> 00:41:34.420
Separating hatred

00:41:35.040 --> 00:41:36.400
Isn't this cheating?

00:41:36.880 --> 00:41:39.360
It's written clearly in the contract.

00:41:39.760 --> 00:41:41.560
because I was anxious to sign it.

00:41:41.800 --> 00:41:43.200
I didn't look carefully.

00:41:44.600 --> 00:41:46.160
It was an emergency.

00:41:46.720 --> 00:41:49.440
Who would have the mood to read such a long contract?

00:41:49.440 --> 00:41:50.440
Separate hatred.

00:41:50.840 --> 00:41:52.960
How could you use our trust

00:41:53.320 --> 00:41:54.440
to do such a thing?

00:41:54.600 --> 00:41:56.560
Xiao Zheng, I told you

00:41:57.480 --> 00:41:59.010
that business is business.

00:42:00.080 --> 00:42:02.800
The contract is written here.

00:42:02.960 --> 00:42:03.880
You have to pay

00:42:04.960 --> 00:42:06.880
or give up the brand.

00:42:13.120 --> 00:42:14.000
This shop

00:42:14.640 --> 00:42:16.040
is our hard work.

00:42:16.720 --> 00:42:19.120
Didn't Jin'er do much for you these years?

00:42:19.880 --> 00:42:21.540
Didn't the hero help you a lot?

00:42:21.760 --> 00:42:23.160
Did Zhang Gui offend you?

00:42:24.320 --> 00:42:25.080
Xiao Zheng.

00:42:26.280 --> 00:42:28.520
We don't want this shop anymore.

00:42:28.600 --> 00:42:29.760
Let's start over.

00:42:29.920 --> 00:42:30.720
Yes.

00:42:30.880 --> 00:42:31.800
We don't want it anymore.

00:42:31.800 --> 00:42:33.840
We can open another shop.

00:42:34.480 --> 00:42:34.960
Yes.

00:42:35.480 --> 00:42:38.480
Let's open another restaurant. I'll pay the principal.

00:42:38.480 --> 00:42:40.340
Don't contact such people again.

00:42:41.840 --> 00:42:43.160
Think carefully.

00:42:43.560 --> 00:42:45.090
Once you hand over the shop,

00:42:45.440 --> 00:42:48.840
all your efforts will be in vain.

00:42:55.600 --> 00:42:56.280
Let's go.

00:43:04.480 --> 00:43:05.410
What's going on?

00:43:06.800 --> 00:43:08.000
Why are they all gone?

00:43:09.440 --> 00:43:10.440
What should we do?

00:43:13.080 --> 00:43:14.000
From now on,

00:43:14.440 --> 00:43:15.960
the Chamber of Commerce

00:43:16.920 --> 00:43:19.280
will be taken over by the Chamber of Commerce.

00:43:19.280 --> 00:43:20.040
Brother Xu.

00:43:20.560 --> 00:43:21.920
That day, I told you

00:43:22.640 --> 00:43:23.840
there must be

00:43:24.240 --> 00:43:25.720
between you and Xiao Zheng.

00:43:25.720 --> 00:43:26.440
Now,

00:43:27.120 --> 00:43:29.280
this misunderstanding should be resolved.

00:43:29.280 --> 00:43:30.480
I misunderstood her.

00:43:31.960 --> 00:43:32.760
Xiao Zheng

00:43:33.560 --> 00:43:35.400
is the best woman in the world.

00:43:37.760 --> 00:43:38.400
Let's go! Let's go! Let's go!
