WEBVTT

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:50.880
You defiled

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:52.000
my lord's innocence.

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:53.080
Husppy, shut up!

00:01:56.440 --> 00:01:56.970
Jia Ding.

00:01:57.240 --> 00:01:58.280
Go to all the buildings in Chang’an now.

00:01:58.280 --> 00:01:59.440
Remove the alarm immediately.

00:01:59.440 --> 00:02:00.440
Ride the fastest horse.

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:00.880
Yes.

00:02:01.360 --> 00:02:02.720
Leave us alone.

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:04.880
Let's go.

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:05.530
Let's go.

00:02:05.800 --> 00:02:06.860
Hurry up! Hurry up!

00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:08.240
I'll kill you! I'll kill you! I'll kill you!

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:09.160
I'll kill you today!

00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:10.080
I'll kill you!

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:12.240
My lord.

00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:12.960
please

00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:14.400
help my lord.

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:15.320
Ziqi.

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:20.520
Take him out for a rest.

00:02:20.960 --> 00:02:21.420
This...

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:23.240
It's here.

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:26.460
Yes, sir. Yes, sir.

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:27.690
Your Excellency

00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:51.980
What are you doing?

00:02:53.240 --> 00:02:54.800
I'm not that easy.

00:02:56.240 --> 00:02:57.520
What are you thinking?

00:02:58.360 --> 00:02:59.760
You did this, didn't you?

00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:01.840
What did I do?

00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:03.960
Do you know what this is?

00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:07.320
Holding fireworks

00:03:07.960 --> 00:03:09.960
This is a cloud signal bomb.

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:12.460
As long as we send three consecutive,

00:03:12.520 --> 00:03:13.560
the whole Chang'an

00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:15.360
will enter level one security.

00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:16.920
All gates are closed.

00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:18.840
All the delinquents, dispatch!

00:03:23.520 --> 00:03:24.980
Come and see for yourself.

00:03:38.480 --> 00:03:39.280
Could it be...

00:03:39.800 --> 00:03:40.960
they come out

00:03:41.520 --> 00:03:43.360
just like me.

00:03:43.760 --> 00:03:45.560
Watch the fireworks.

00:03:51.079 --> 00:03:51.640
Sit down.

00:03:52.360 --> 00:03:52.960
Sit down.

00:03:56.640 --> 00:03:57.840
I, Xu Ziqi,

00:03:58.079 --> 00:04:00.040
for half of my life.

00:04:00.520 --> 00:04:02.180
I've never made any mistakes.

00:04:02.480 --> 00:04:04.340
Nothing good ever since I met you.

00:04:04.800 --> 00:04:06.800
Catch the thief! The thief ran away!

00:04:06.960 --> 00:04:08.360
He was seen in the shower.

00:04:08.360 --> 00:04:09.680
I was hurt by flesh.

00:04:09.840 --> 00:04:11.640
But these are not important.

00:04:12.320 --> 00:04:13.200
Now,

00:04:13.560 --> 00:04:15.220
you ruined the rest of my life.

00:04:15.560 --> 00:04:16.079
I...

00:04:17.920 --> 00:04:18.800
I'll kill you.

00:04:36.120 --> 00:04:38.560
Do you think being an official is important?

00:04:38.560 --> 00:04:39.120
Yes.

00:04:39.120 --> 00:04:40.250
It's not important.

00:04:40.760 --> 00:04:42.120
What matters is gold.

00:04:42.560 --> 00:04:43.200
Lord Di

00:04:43.200 --> 00:04:44.930
recommended me to be promoted.

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:46.730
I said I don't want a promotion.

00:04:46.880 --> 00:04:47.360
I said I only want

00:04:47.360 --> 00:04:48.960
give me 100 taels of gold

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:50.120
and let me leave early.

00:04:50.120 --> 00:04:52.050
and get married and have children.

00:04:52.120 --> 00:04:53.760
I don't even know

00:04:53.880 --> 00:04:55.120
the house in the east market,

00:04:55.120 --> 00:04:56.560
The deposit of the matchmaker

00:04:56.560 --> 00:04:57.680
has been paid.

00:04:57.680 --> 00:04:58.760
Do you understand?

00:04:58.760 --> 00:04:59.560
I understand.

00:05:00.080 --> 00:05:01.520
It's all arranged.

00:05:02.120 --> 00:05:03.380
You don't understand.

00:05:03.760 --> 00:05:04.560
It's all gone.

00:05:05.240 --> 00:05:06.120
Because of you,

00:05:06.440 --> 00:05:07.560
because of you.

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:10.880
I'm sorry.

00:05:19.800 --> 00:05:20.260
My lord.

00:05:20.560 --> 00:05:21.120
General Qin.

00:05:21.120 --> 00:05:22.680
Bring the Imperial Guards to Pingkang Fang

00:05:22.680 --> 00:05:25.520
to investigate the flaming signal.

00:05:32.880 --> 00:05:34.010
I'll turn myself in.

00:05:37.760 --> 00:05:41.320
Can you reduce your sentence?

00:05:41.320 --> 00:05:42.440
You're dead.

00:05:45.680 --> 00:05:47.520
Am I that bad?

00:05:49.800 --> 00:05:50.960
Stay here.

00:06:02.240 --> 00:06:02.880
Tonight,

00:06:03.440 --> 00:06:04.880
I did it

00:06:04.880 --> 00:06:05.440
I did it.

00:06:06.120 --> 00:06:06.880
OK. Guards.

00:06:06.880 --> 00:06:07.960
So manly.

00:06:08.120 --> 00:06:09.120
Arrest Xu Ziqi.

00:06:09.440 --> 00:06:10.840
and cane him thirty times

00:06:10.880 --> 00:06:12.080
as a warning to others.

00:06:12.080 --> 00:06:12.640
Yes.

00:06:24.120 --> 00:06:25.120
So cruel.

00:06:36.760 --> 00:06:38.000
Who are you?

00:06:38.760 --> 00:06:39.820
Let's talk inside.

00:06:51.960 --> 00:06:53.120
30 strokes.

00:06:53.680 --> 00:06:54.960
Will he kill him?

00:06:55.440 --> 00:06:56.440
It's the butt.

00:06:56.640 --> 00:06:57.370
Not the head.

00:06:57.560 --> 00:06:59.220
I don't think anyone will die.

00:06:59.760 --> 00:07:00.320
I...

00:07:01.800 --> 00:07:02.320
Let me ask you.

00:07:02.320 --> 00:07:03.640
If it's broken,

00:07:04.200 --> 00:07:05.260
the rest of his life

00:07:05.440 --> 00:07:06.440
for the rest of his life?

00:07:06.440 --> 00:07:08.240
Are you serious about

00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:09.560
Really?

00:07:12.240 --> 00:07:13.880
I don't want this to happen.

00:07:14.320 --> 00:07:15.440
This...

00:07:15.960 --> 00:07:17.760
Okay, let's go back to the palace.

00:07:17.760 --> 00:07:18.320
Take him away.

00:07:18.320 --> 00:07:18.680
Yes.

00:07:22.240 --> 00:07:24.120
How can I raise him?

00:07:25.560 --> 00:07:27.160
Apply medicine on him first.

00:07:27.360 --> 00:07:28.290
Shouldn't we...

00:07:28.440 --> 00:07:30.320
What did you do?

00:07:31.360 --> 00:07:32.760
Take off his pants.

00:07:34.640 --> 00:07:35.440
You witch!

00:07:35.520 --> 00:07:36.440
You ruined my reputation!

00:07:36.440 --> 00:07:36.840
You...

00:07:37.120 --> 00:07:37.580
My lord.

00:07:37.640 --> 00:07:38.240
Please calm down.

00:07:38.240 --> 00:07:39.560
I can't explain

00:07:39.960 --> 00:07:41.240
I can't explain it.

00:07:41.560 --> 00:07:43.120
I might die.

00:07:43.560 --> 00:07:45.320
Why don't we play along?

00:07:46.240 --> 00:07:47.570
That's not what I meant.

00:07:47.800 --> 00:07:49.400
I can be responsible for you.

00:07:49.800 --> 00:07:50.320
I...

00:07:51.120 --> 00:07:51.640
Lost.

00:07:57.320 --> 00:07:58.120
In that case,

00:07:59.120 --> 00:07:59.640
My lord.

00:08:00.680 --> 00:08:03.440
Let's take her to the mansion first.

00:08:04.120 --> 00:08:04.880
No.

00:08:07.320 --> 00:08:08.440
Just let me die.

00:08:09.880 --> 00:08:10.340
My lord.

00:08:10.640 --> 00:08:12.520
You won't fall to the second floor.

00:08:12.520 --> 00:08:13.800
What if you break it?

00:08:14.440 --> 00:08:16.970
I have chest tightness. I need some fresh air.

00:08:18.520 --> 00:08:19.000
Okay.

00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:22.240
Sir.

00:08:22.240 --> 00:08:22.700
My lord.

00:08:40.559 --> 00:08:41.200
Yang Lin.

00:08:41.960 --> 00:08:42.760
Take her back.

00:08:43.039 --> 00:08:43.440
Yes.

00:08:50.800 --> 00:08:51.530
Come with me.

00:09:06.560 --> 00:09:07.720
Your Majesty,

00:09:08.080 --> 00:09:09.680
I, Xu Ziqi, am here.

00:09:14.600 --> 00:09:16.200
Lord Xu Ziqi.

00:09:16.840 --> 00:09:18.170
Do you admit your crime?

00:09:18.280 --> 00:09:20.800
It's unforgivable to alarm Chang'an.

00:09:21.560 --> 00:09:24.160
Xu Ziqi neglected his duty

00:09:24.840 --> 00:09:26.370
caused a shock in Chang'an.

00:09:27.080 --> 00:09:28.610
and disturbed His Majesty.

00:09:29.480 --> 00:09:31.960
He should be executed according to the law.

00:09:32.680 --> 00:09:33.540
Your Highness.

00:09:33.600 --> 00:09:34.560
Since the founding of the country,

00:09:34.560 --> 00:09:37.760
the Xu family has sacrificed their lives for the country.

00:09:37.960 --> 00:09:39.080
Now the Xu family

00:09:39.960 --> 00:09:42.680
in the Xu family.

00:09:46.080 --> 00:09:48.840
Although this matter involves many people,

00:09:49.800 --> 00:09:51.800
it's not unforgivable.

00:09:52.080 --> 00:09:53.920
Her Majesty is kind-hearted.

00:09:54.200 --> 00:09:56.200
I can't bear to see the end of the Xu family.

00:09:56.200 --> 00:09:57.930
I'll give you a chance to atone.

00:09:57.960 --> 00:10:00.440
Thank you, Your Majesty.

00:10:02.280 --> 00:10:04.480
The chairman of the Chamber of Commerce

00:10:04.560 --> 00:10:06.020
colluded with an official

00:10:06.440 --> 00:10:07.480
and cheated.

00:10:07.920 --> 00:10:10.250
causing the prices of our dynasty to rise.

00:10:10.320 --> 00:10:11.680
and the people suffered.

00:10:11.680 --> 00:10:14.400
His Majesty has sent spies many times

00:10:15.200 --> 00:10:16.600
to investigate this matter.

00:10:16.600 --> 00:10:18.720
but I didn't get much.

00:10:19.280 --> 00:10:20.200
I understand.

00:10:20.920 --> 00:10:22.200
But I wonder

00:10:22.480 --> 00:10:23.400
at the moment.

00:10:23.680 --> 00:10:26.040
There is a ledger in the Chamber of Commerce.

00:10:26.040 --> 00:10:27.920
which is the evidence

00:10:28.200 --> 00:10:29.840
to sabotage the people.

00:10:30.560 --> 00:10:31.840
Go find a way to get it.

00:10:31.960 --> 00:10:34.040
I will not let you down.

00:10:34.800 --> 00:10:36.130
and retrieve the ledger

00:10:36.800 --> 00:10:38.960
to thank Your Majesty.

00:10:54.200 --> 00:10:56.560
Your family is quite rich.

00:10:56.960 --> 00:10:57.840
At this point,

00:10:57.960 --> 00:10:59.680
Let's say something nice first.

00:10:59.680 --> 00:11:00.840
From now on,

00:11:01.200 --> 00:11:02.840
can help me.

00:11:05.440 --> 00:11:06.040
Mr. Bang.

00:11:06.680 --> 00:11:08.560
Since you have taken me in,

00:11:08.800 --> 00:11:10.400
I will do my best

00:11:10.600 --> 00:11:11.400
and serve you.

00:11:18.200 --> 00:11:19.960
I admire your talent.

00:11:20.320 --> 00:11:21.840
I'm willing to stay by your side.

00:11:21.840 --> 00:11:23.160
to share your burden

00:11:23.440 --> 00:11:24.680
to share your burden.

00:11:26.040 --> 00:11:28.400
You've been

00:11:30.160 --> 00:11:30.560
You...

00:11:33.440 --> 00:11:34.040
My lord.

00:11:35.040 --> 00:11:37.440
Do you want Miss Xiao

00:11:37.600 --> 00:11:39.080
to be your personal maid?

00:11:44.280 --> 00:11:44.680
Maid?

00:11:44.840 --> 00:11:45.560
Personal?

00:11:48.920 --> 00:11:50.200
Mr. Bang, no!

00:11:51.920 --> 00:11:53.200
No, no, no.

00:11:53.480 --> 00:11:54.340
Take your time.

00:11:54.560 --> 00:11:56.080
There's no rush.

00:11:59.560 --> 00:12:00.040
My lord,

00:12:00.680 --> 00:12:02.680
How about this?

00:12:03.400 --> 00:12:04.560
Let her make you

00:12:04.560 --> 00:12:05.480
a guard.

00:12:06.200 --> 00:12:07.200
What do you think?

00:12:08.800 --> 00:12:09.560
No way.

00:12:09.800 --> 00:12:11.200
If she goes crazy again,

00:12:12.440 --> 00:12:13.560
what will you do?

00:12:19.840 --> 00:12:20.900
What are you doing?

00:12:21.080 --> 00:12:22.140
What are you doing?

00:12:22.480 --> 00:12:22.960
No!

00:12:23.800 --> 00:12:24.480
No!

00:12:25.480 --> 00:12:27.440
Chief Yang,

00:12:28.320 --> 00:12:29.520
You take care of this.

00:12:30.480 --> 00:12:31.320
Yes, my lord.

00:12:35.560 --> 00:12:36.440
Sir, please.

00:12:40.560 --> 00:12:41.680
Goodbye, Mr. Bang.

00:12:43.680 --> 00:12:44.610
Thank goodness.

00:12:45.840 --> 00:12:47.560
This woman is quite vulgar.

00:12:48.680 --> 00:12:50.920
But how could she be so rude?

00:12:53.800 --> 00:12:55.460
That woman coveted my beauty.

00:12:55.680 --> 00:12:56.610
and despicable.

00:12:57.040 --> 00:12:57.960
The 36 strategies have a plan.

00:12:57.960 --> 00:12:58.840
to leave.

00:12:59.960 --> 00:13:00.760
I understand.

00:13:01.080 --> 00:13:02.140
Prepare the sedan.

00:13:09.400 --> 00:13:10.080
Li.

00:13:11.560 --> 00:13:13.620
Chairman of the Chamber of Commerce.

00:13:14.120 --> 00:13:15.850
A special soldier from heaven.

00:13:17.200 --> 00:13:18.440
Her Majesty is kind.

00:13:18.800 --> 00:13:19.800
That's why...

00:13:20.680 --> 00:13:22.040
to help you.

00:13:24.040 --> 00:13:24.800
Who is it?

00:13:26.200 --> 00:13:28.920
The palace merchants are fighting for feathers.

00:13:28.920 --> 00:13:30.380
A four-feet combination.

00:13:31.240 --> 00:13:32.770
The one who can tell the code

00:13:33.160 --> 00:13:35.480
is your special soldier.

00:13:37.440 --> 00:13:39.570
There's a lot of information tonight.

00:13:40.440 --> 00:13:41.640
Where should I start?

00:13:44.720 --> 00:13:45.440
Lord Xu.

00:13:45.800 --> 00:13:47.200
Why are you in front of our house?

00:13:47.200 --> 00:13:47.680
I...

00:13:49.680 --> 00:13:50.720
We can't stay here for long.

00:13:50.720 --> 00:13:51.450
Come with me.

00:13:51.560 --> 00:13:52.200
Hurry up.

00:13:55.840 --> 00:13:56.200
Wait.

00:13:56.600 --> 00:13:57.560
Slow down.

00:13:57.720 --> 00:13:58.920
I'm still injured.

00:14:01.480 --> 00:14:02.600
Be gentle.

00:14:02.680 --> 00:14:03.210
It hurts.

00:14:04.920 --> 00:14:05.320
I...

00:14:05.800 --> 00:14:07.080
Be gentle.

00:14:07.320 --> 00:14:07.960
It hurts.

00:14:09.440 --> 00:14:10.480
It hurts.

00:14:10.680 --> 00:14:11.560
Be gentle.

00:14:17.320 --> 00:14:18.080
That girl...

00:14:18.800 --> 00:14:20.200
is my nemesis.

00:14:20.600 --> 00:14:21.200
And now...

00:14:23.400 --> 00:14:25.680
Li, it's my fault.

00:14:26.160 --> 00:14:27.090
Marry her for me.

00:14:27.480 --> 00:14:28.600
But she likes you.

00:14:31.040 --> 00:14:33.300
Didn't you see how she looked at me today?

00:14:33.680 --> 00:14:35.200
There are so many girls who love me.

00:14:35.200 --> 00:14:36.080
All the eyes

00:14:36.080 --> 00:14:37.010
is not her color.

00:14:37.800 --> 00:14:38.860
Let her take a look.

00:14:39.440 --> 00:14:40.320
I'm scared.

00:14:40.720 --> 00:14:41.480
It's okay.

00:14:42.080 --> 00:14:43.540
I have a way to kick her out.

00:14:44.080 --> 00:14:44.720
What is it?

00:14:45.840 --> 00:14:47.170
She didn't go to school.

00:14:47.280 --> 00:14:48.960
I'll bring someone to get her tomorrow.

00:14:48.960 --> 00:14:50.560
and expel her from Chang'an.

00:14:52.560 --> 00:14:53.040
Now,

00:14:53.600 --> 00:14:54.730
this is the only way.

00:14:55.400 --> 00:14:58.160
But this woman is really strange.

00:14:59.840 --> 00:15:01.200
Indeed.

00:15:02.040 --> 00:15:03.970
She came to Chang'an for no reason.

00:15:05.440 --> 00:15:08.320
Is she a special soldier?

00:15:08.600 --> 00:15:10.460
Ziqi, what are you talking about?

00:15:11.800 --> 00:15:13.800
I said something is fishy.

00:15:13.960 --> 00:15:14.690
Ridiculous!

00:15:15.160 --> 00:15:16.080
Not only did you harm me,

00:15:16.080 --> 00:15:16.810
but also you.

00:15:17.680 --> 00:15:18.680
How could this be?

00:15:21.440 --> 00:15:21.920
Li,

00:15:22.800 --> 00:15:23.720
That day,

00:15:24.680 --> 00:15:26.560
with her that day?

00:15:28.320 --> 00:15:29.560
I really

00:15:30.680 --> 00:15:32.210
I don't remember anything.

00:15:35.440 --> 00:15:36.770
What are you looking at?

00:15:47.560 --> 00:15:48.200
Lord Xu.

00:15:48.320 --> 00:15:49.380
Where is the thief?

00:15:49.480 --> 00:15:50.340
In the kitchen.

00:15:54.960 --> 00:15:55.620
Over there.

00:15:58.840 --> 00:15:59.600
Xu Ziqi.

00:16:01.920 --> 00:16:02.560
Xu Ziqi.

00:16:02.920 --> 00:16:04.800
How's your injury?

00:16:05.200 --> 00:16:06.400
I was going to see you.

00:16:06.440 --> 00:16:08.440
I even made you pork trotter soup.

00:16:08.800 --> 00:16:09.680
It's good for your health.

00:16:09.680 --> 00:16:10.200
Let's try it.

00:16:10.200 --> 00:16:10.600
Wait.

00:16:12.560 --> 00:16:14.280
Hua Xiao Zheng, let me ask you.

00:16:14.800 --> 00:16:15.930
Answer me honestly.

00:16:15.960 --> 00:16:17.920
Do you have to stay in Chang'an?

00:16:19.400 --> 00:16:19.800
Yes.

00:16:22.320 --> 00:16:24.850
The palace merchants fight for the feathers.

00:16:29.840 --> 00:16:30.560
No.

00:16:31.200 --> 00:16:32.160
What is it?

00:16:32.480 --> 00:16:33.400
In that case,

00:16:34.080 --> 00:16:35.480
don't blame me for being rude.

00:16:35.480 --> 00:16:36.800
Take him down!

00:16:38.600 --> 00:16:39.660
What are you doing?

00:16:39.680 --> 00:16:41.200
Rebel Hua Xiao Zheng!

00:16:41.560 --> 00:16:43.800
He has no evidence. He is a thief.

00:16:44.200 --> 00:16:46.200
To protect our people,

00:16:46.440 --> 00:16:47.800
to protect our people.

00:16:48.960 --> 00:16:51.680
Xu Ziqi, don't go too far!

00:16:52.160 --> 00:16:53.490
You don't have a prison.

00:16:53.800 --> 00:16:55.800
You must be expelled from Chang'an.

00:16:55.800 --> 00:16:57.440
Who says I don't have a detention center?

00:16:57.440 --> 00:16:58.200
Go away.

00:16:59.080 --> 00:17:00.160
It's ready.

00:17:02.280 --> 00:17:03.040
What is this?

00:17:03.560 --> 00:17:04.720
Is this a prison?

00:17:14.040 --> 00:17:15.400
Is this prison real?

00:17:16.480 --> 00:17:17.200
Yes.

00:17:19.119 --> 00:17:20.720
I thought you helped me once,

00:17:21.119 --> 00:17:21.839
I just made some soup

00:17:21.839 --> 00:17:23.300
to replenish your health.

00:17:23.839 --> 00:17:25.000
as an apology.

00:17:26.240 --> 00:17:28.280
I didn't expect you to be such a person.

00:17:28.280 --> 00:17:29.440
You didn't do anything wrong.

00:17:29.440 --> 00:17:30.770
You hit me when I'm down.

00:17:31.280 --> 00:17:32.480
I was wrong about you.

00:17:37.960 --> 00:17:39.020
What are you doing?

00:17:39.200 --> 00:17:40.660
You want to splash it on me?

00:17:42.680 --> 00:17:43.880
I just want to show you

00:17:44.200 --> 00:17:47.160
how good the soup is.

00:17:47.920 --> 00:17:49.250
Even if it's for the dog,

00:17:49.640 --> 00:17:50.970
I won't let you drink it.

00:17:51.040 --> 00:17:52.600
You bastard!

00:17:57.960 --> 00:17:59.400
Take it. Drink it.

00:17:59.960 --> 00:18:00.440
I...

00:18:11.240 --> 00:18:11.720
Li,

00:18:12.200 --> 00:18:14.330
Do you think I'm going to die this year?

00:18:15.360 --> 00:18:17.000
Who would have thought that she'd be punished?

00:18:17.000 --> 00:18:17.720
Yes.

00:18:18.200 --> 00:18:19.720
Who would have thought that Madam Xue

00:18:19.720 --> 00:18:21.160
was kicked by a donkey?

00:18:21.200 --> 00:18:23.130
He used his guarantor to set her up.

00:18:23.480 --> 00:18:24.640
I asked Husppy to ask

00:18:25.040 --> 00:18:26.960
She said Madam Xue didn't know anything.

00:18:26.960 --> 00:18:27.920
She thought I was sincere

00:18:27.920 --> 00:18:29.180
to keep Hua Xiao Zheng.

00:18:29.200 --> 00:18:30.400
You want to fawn on me?

00:18:30.720 --> 00:18:31.880
You're right. You're right.

00:18:31.880 --> 00:18:33.000
All the girls in Chang'an

00:18:33.000 --> 00:18:34.440
in Chang'an.

00:18:35.000 --> 00:18:36.520
No one knows what you like.

00:18:38.360 --> 00:18:39.760
I've informed the Chamber of Commerce

00:18:39.760 --> 00:18:40.490
to work here.

00:18:40.680 --> 00:18:41.640
to this place.

00:18:42.240 --> 00:18:43.500
I won't go back for now.

00:18:47.400 --> 00:18:48.960
About the Chamber of Commerce,

00:18:48.960 --> 00:18:51.040
You usually take care of things in the mansion.

00:18:51.040 --> 00:18:52.240
of the Chamber of Commerce.

00:18:52.240 --> 00:18:53.770
of the Chamber of Commerce.

00:18:54.480 --> 00:18:55.400
Why do you ask?

00:18:57.120 --> 00:18:57.650
Nothing.

00:18:58.200 --> 00:18:59.130
I just want to say

00:18:59.360 --> 00:19:00.520
if you

00:19:00.520 --> 00:19:02.050
in the Chamber of Commerce,

00:19:02.200 --> 00:19:03.240
Will Hua

00:19:03.880 --> 00:19:04.760
bother you?

00:19:06.600 --> 00:19:08.000
I'm really afraid of her.

00:19:08.680 --> 00:19:09.240
Besides,

00:19:09.720 --> 00:19:10.880
she couldn't

00:19:11.440 --> 00:19:12.440
in front of me.

00:19:13.000 --> 00:19:14.130
When the time comes,

00:19:14.480 --> 00:19:15.880
and take my whole family.

00:19:16.360 --> 00:19:17.360
and my body.

00:19:18.000 --> 00:19:19.530
and pregnant with my child.

00:19:22.640 --> 00:19:24.360
What a disaster!

00:19:25.200 --> 00:19:26.920
What a disaster!

00:19:46.920 --> 00:19:48.050
Separating hatred.

00:19:48.640 --> 00:19:50.840
You don't go home all day.

00:19:51.600 --> 00:19:52.730
If you don't go home,

00:19:52.880 --> 00:19:53.920
how can you appreciate

00:19:53.920 --> 00:19:55.680
my excellent business brain?

00:19:55.960 --> 00:19:57.680
This will directly affect

00:19:57.680 --> 00:19:59.520
my whole family.

00:20:03.960 --> 00:20:08.400
Looks like I have to do something.

00:20:09.200 --> 00:20:09.880
Sir.

00:20:10.480 --> 00:20:10.960
My lord!

00:20:11.840 --> 00:20:12.440
Bad news!

00:20:12.440 --> 00:20:13.400
What's the rush?

00:20:13.720 --> 00:20:14.920
Hua... Hua Xiaochi...

00:20:14.920 --> 00:20:16.380
She can't take it anymore.

00:20:18.920 --> 00:20:21.240
The Thirty-six Tactics of Hard Method.

00:20:40.000 --> 00:20:42.240
Miss Xiao Zheng, what's wrong?

00:20:46.440 --> 00:20:47.040
Ms. Zheng.

00:20:48.760 --> 00:20:49.560
What's wrong?

00:20:52.960 --> 00:20:54.960
I have a serious illness today.

00:20:55.720 --> 00:20:57.440
I will soon die.

00:20:58.240 --> 00:21:00.440
I have no other wishes.

00:21:01.200 --> 00:21:04.440
I just want to see Mr. Bang one last time.

00:21:05.600 --> 00:21:07.600
I'll die without regret.

00:21:11.520 --> 00:21:13.640
Okay, I'll go now.

00:21:16.520 --> 00:21:18.200
Do you want to go back and take a look?

00:21:18.200 --> 00:21:18.600
No.

00:21:19.200 --> 00:21:19.960
Just go back.

00:21:20.720 --> 00:21:21.760
When will she

00:21:22.440 --> 00:21:23.040
When will she come?

00:21:23.040 --> 00:21:23.960
Just tell me.

00:21:25.120 --> 00:21:25.600
This...

00:21:26.840 --> 00:21:28.040
It's here. It's here.

00:21:35.760 --> 00:21:37.120
Thirty-six.

00:21:49.840 --> 00:21:51.880
Your chairman is back.

00:21:53.720 --> 00:21:56.040
Then why are you here?

00:21:57.280 --> 00:21:58.440
I was waiting for you to die.

00:21:58.440 --> 00:21:58.960
And...

00:21:59.120 --> 00:22:00.160
to inform my lord.

00:22:06.200 --> 00:22:09.120
Husppy, who gave you your name?

00:22:09.920 --> 00:22:11.200
My lord gave it to me.

00:22:11.520 --> 00:22:13.050
I'm the second in my family.

00:22:13.160 --> 00:22:14.560
Ha. Let's say it's happy.

00:22:17.920 --> 00:22:18.980
That's a good name.

00:22:20.000 --> 00:22:21.360
Tell your chairman

00:22:21.720 --> 00:22:23.120
I'm going to die tonight.

00:22:23.240 --> 00:22:23.680
Okay.

00:22:26.280 --> 00:22:26.920
Sir.

00:22:27.160 --> 00:22:28.960
Miss Xiao is dead tonight.

00:22:29.520 --> 00:22:31.160
You're indeed a loyal dog.

00:22:37.840 --> 00:22:42.200
The 36 strategies surrounded Wei to save Zhao.

00:22:52.120 --> 00:22:55.120
Separate hatred.

00:22:57.400 --> 00:22:59.720
Separate hatred

00:23:02.200 --> 00:23:03.920
Ghost!

00:23:04.240 --> 00:23:05.600
Stop! Stop!

00:23:10.040 --> 00:23:10.760
Help!

00:23:11.640 --> 00:23:12.640
Don't run, ghost!

00:23:21.960 --> 00:23:23.760
Ghost! Ghost!

00:23:24.480 --> 00:23:26.200
Ghost.

00:23:26.440 --> 00:23:26.920
Ghost.

00:23:27.120 --> 00:23:27.520
Ghost.

00:23:27.960 --> 00:23:28.480
Ghost.

00:23:28.840 --> 00:23:29.440
Where?

00:23:29.960 --> 00:23:30.920
I kicked him.

00:23:31.400 --> 00:23:32.930
Even a ghost can kick it off.

00:23:34.440 --> 00:23:35.040
Ziqi.

00:23:35.920 --> 00:23:36.850
can you stay here

00:23:37.400 --> 00:23:38.280
stay longer?

00:23:39.200 --> 00:23:39.920
Sure.

00:23:40.200 --> 00:23:41.460
I've been living here.

00:23:41.680 --> 00:23:42.440
Don't worry.

00:23:42.960 --> 00:23:44.820
It's good to stay in the same room.

00:23:45.200 --> 00:23:48.120
The tree of 36 strategies blooms.

00:23:59.720 --> 00:24:00.380
Who are you?

00:24:00.720 --> 00:24:01.320
You are...

00:24:02.360 --> 00:24:02.680
Keep quiet.

00:24:02.680 --> 00:24:03.340
Who are you?

00:24:05.440 --> 00:24:06.360
It's me.

00:24:08.400 --> 00:24:09.200
What's wrong?

00:24:10.120 --> 00:24:11.780
Something serious happened.

00:24:13.200 --> 00:24:15.640
Do you know King of Hell Xu?

00:24:15.680 --> 00:24:16.720
Lord Xu.

00:24:16.960 --> 00:24:18.160
I know.

00:24:18.640 --> 00:24:20.120
Do you know

00:24:20.120 --> 00:24:22.040
who gave the medicine

00:24:22.440 --> 00:24:23.720
Who drugged him?

00:24:24.640 --> 00:24:26.040
Mr. Bang.

00:24:26.240 --> 00:24:26.770
Good job.

00:24:26.960 --> 00:24:29.640
Mr. Bang did it himself.

00:24:29.920 --> 00:24:32.160
He never gave it to others.

00:24:32.440 --> 00:24:33.300
Have you heard?

00:24:33.440 --> 00:24:35.120
Mr. Bang, the chairman of the Chamber of Commerce,

00:24:35.120 --> 00:24:36.640
and the delinquent, King of Hell.

00:24:36.640 --> 00:24:38.170
I've seen it several times.

00:24:38.400 --> 00:24:39.280
Two men

00:24:39.280 --> 00:24:41.200
enter the house together.

00:24:42.200 --> 00:24:43.440
I knew it.

00:24:43.760 --> 00:24:45.360
it's been so many years.

00:24:45.440 --> 00:24:46.960
Chairman Bang and Lord Xu

00:24:46.960 --> 00:24:48.040
are not married.

00:24:48.200 --> 00:24:50.060
It turns out that we are brothers.

00:24:50.160 --> 00:24:51.720
It's hard to say goodbye.

00:24:53.520 --> 00:24:55.200
That's why

00:24:55.680 --> 00:24:56.600
I can't stay

00:24:56.640 --> 00:24:57.280
in the inn.

00:24:57.720 --> 00:24:58.280
No.

00:24:58.880 --> 00:25:00.440
What should I do if you leave?

00:25:00.440 --> 00:25:01.900
If I continue to live here,

00:25:02.280 --> 00:25:03.680
both of us will be doomed.

00:25:09.680 --> 00:25:10.200
Lord Xu.

00:25:11.040 --> 00:25:12.040
My lord, bad news.

00:25:12.960 --> 00:25:14.120
Hua Xiaochi again.

00:25:14.280 --> 00:25:15.520
Who else could it be?

00:25:50.520 --> 00:25:51.320
This is all...

00:25:51.840 --> 00:25:52.440
Chairman!

00:25:53.000 --> 00:25:53.600
Chairman!

00:25:53.840 --> 00:25:56.160
[I'll wait for you at home]

00:25:56.240 --> 00:25:57.640
I'll wait for you at home.

00:25:58.000 --> 00:25:58.520
Okay.

00:26:02.680 --> 00:26:03.160
Sir.

00:26:03.520 --> 00:26:05.040
Sir, you are allergic to pollen.

00:26:05.040 --> 00:26:07.300
Come on, let me help you back to your room.

00:26:10.960 --> 00:26:13.360
It turns out that you are allergic to pollen

00:26:14.600 --> 00:26:16.440
is allergic to pollen.

00:26:18.600 --> 00:26:20.720
Let alone the infatuated girl Hua Xiaochi.

00:26:20.720 --> 00:26:22.280
After the night at Pingkang Fang,

00:26:22.280 --> 00:26:23.960
he was carried by Chairman Bang

00:26:23.960 --> 00:26:24.880
by Chairman Bang.

00:26:24.880 --> 00:26:26.000
But unexpectedly,

00:26:26.880 --> 00:26:27.640
After that,

00:26:27.760 --> 00:26:28.680
Chairman Bang

00:26:28.680 --> 00:26:31.000
never stepped into the mansion.

00:26:31.480 --> 00:26:33.410
and stayed at Yuelai Inn every day.

00:26:33.680 --> 00:26:36.400
Do you know why?

00:26:36.760 --> 00:26:37.960
For the King of Hell.

00:26:38.040 --> 00:26:39.360
But Hua Xiao Zheng

00:26:39.440 --> 00:26:40.480
is a woman.

00:26:40.760 --> 00:26:41.600
for Mr. Bang.

00:26:41.640 --> 00:26:44.120
for President Bang.

00:26:44.680 --> 00:26:45.920
I just hope Mr. Fang

00:26:46.000 --> 00:26:47.000
find out

00:26:47.000 --> 00:26:48.920
the true love around you.

00:26:49.120 --> 00:26:49.960
Yes.

00:26:49.960 --> 00:26:50.880
A woman

00:26:51.120 --> 00:26:53.120
is so brave and generous.

00:26:53.280 --> 00:26:55.400
You're a heroine.

00:26:56.480 --> 00:26:57.040
Okay.

00:26:57.120 --> 00:26:59.000
Okay.

00:27:03.000 --> 00:27:04.120
Thank you.

00:27:04.720 --> 00:27:05.640
But

00:27:06.160 --> 00:27:07.680
a little too much?

00:27:09.640 --> 00:27:10.440
These days,

00:27:10.520 --> 00:27:12.280
I've heard

00:27:12.440 --> 00:27:13.200
in Chang'an.

00:27:13.680 --> 00:27:15.040
You are the best.

00:27:15.880 --> 00:27:17.440
I'm touched by you.

00:27:18.360 --> 00:27:19.290
You're welcome.

00:27:19.520 --> 00:27:20.760
Thank you.

00:27:21.200 --> 00:27:21.960
Thanks to

00:27:21.960 --> 00:27:24.440
The material you provided is good.

00:27:25.200 --> 00:27:26.400
You're welcome.

00:27:27.000 --> 00:27:28.040
It's my duty.

00:27:28.600 --> 00:27:29.400
Good stories

00:27:29.640 --> 00:27:31.120
should be shared with you.

00:27:31.360 --> 00:27:32.640
What a touching story.

00:27:32.720 --> 00:27:34.120
In the future,

00:27:34.120 --> 00:27:35.960
I'm counting on you.

00:27:36.520 --> 00:27:37.240
Go ahead.

00:27:37.640 --> 00:27:39.280
I'll take my leave.

00:27:49.760 --> 00:27:50.520
Stop!

00:27:56.040 --> 00:27:57.760
You scorpion woman!

00:27:58.240 --> 00:27:59.480
You ruined my happiness

00:27:59.480 --> 00:28:00.680
for my happiness.

00:28:02.240 --> 00:28:03.400
How did I ruin

00:28:03.400 --> 00:28:04.400
your happiness?

00:28:04.680 --> 00:28:06.200
No one in Chang'an

00:28:06.200 --> 00:28:07.460
would dare to marry me.

00:28:08.680 --> 00:28:10.600
Knowing you and getting to know you,

00:28:10.600 --> 00:28:12.200
I knew it was a rumor.

00:28:12.440 --> 00:28:13.280
You know me.

00:28:13.680 --> 00:28:14.600
and never married me.

00:28:14.600 --> 00:28:15.600
How do you know me?

00:28:19.200 --> 00:28:20.440
Brother, it's here.

00:28:20.760 --> 00:28:21.360
This is...

00:28:22.200 --> 00:28:24.760
Xu Yan, Xu Ziqi.

00:28:25.440 --> 00:28:26.360
Is it time

00:28:26.360 --> 00:28:27.200
pay us back?

00:28:28.440 --> 00:28:29.880
What money do you owe?

00:28:30.200 --> 00:28:31.240
Didn't I tell you?

00:28:31.880 --> 00:28:33.680
I booked a house and a blind date.

00:28:33.960 --> 00:28:35.040
and paid the deposit.

00:28:35.040 --> 00:28:36.100
It's all borrowed.

00:28:36.160 --> 00:28:37.820
Lend money to pay the deposit.

00:28:39.960 --> 00:28:41.620
My retirement reward is gone.

00:28:42.120 --> 00:28:43.920
I don't have any money now.

00:28:44.000 --> 00:28:45.130
I can't pay you back.

00:28:45.520 --> 00:28:46.040
Then today,

00:28:46.040 --> 00:28:47.200
I'll cut off one of your arms

00:28:47.200 --> 00:28:48.060
to pay the debt.

00:28:49.400 --> 00:28:49.930
Brother.

00:28:50.160 --> 00:28:51.200
We can't beat him.

00:28:52.960 --> 00:28:54.640
Then cut off her arm to pay the debt.

00:28:54.640 --> 00:28:55.760
Okay, cut it.

00:28:56.000 --> 00:28:56.680
Don't.

00:28:56.920 --> 00:28:57.280
Don't.

00:28:57.280 --> 00:28:57.640
No.

00:28:57.640 --> 00:28:59.280
I'll pay you back.

00:28:59.440 --> 00:29:00.000
Really?

00:29:01.960 --> 00:29:02.760
Give it to her.

00:29:04.200 --> 00:29:04.680
Wait.

00:29:11.480 --> 00:29:16.840
Hua Xiaochi, pay Xu Ziqi back.

00:29:17.120 --> 00:29:18.160
Darling

00:29:18.480 --> 00:29:20.680
You even raised the price.

00:29:43.520 --> 00:29:45.000
If you can't pay me back,

00:29:45.160 --> 00:29:46.760
I'll cut off two of your arms.

00:29:47.400 --> 00:29:47.930
Let's go.

00:29:49.000 --> 00:29:49.440
Let's go.

00:29:49.440 --> 00:29:51.960
Press the handprint without bargaining.

00:30:02.440 --> 00:30:03.840
Why are you following me?

00:30:13.160 --> 00:30:14.160
I thought about

00:30:14.160 --> 00:30:15.960
carefully.

00:30:16.640 --> 00:30:18.960
I think

00:30:18.960 --> 00:30:20.360
towards marriage

00:30:20.920 --> 00:30:21.980
There's a problem.

00:30:22.280 --> 00:30:23.140
Think about it.

00:30:23.640 --> 00:30:24.600
We've never met.

00:30:24.760 --> 00:30:25.680
No.

00:30:25.960 --> 00:30:27.560
We've never lived together.

00:30:27.600 --> 00:30:29.200
How can we grow old together?

00:30:29.840 --> 00:30:31.680
What if they don't fit each other?

00:30:31.680 --> 00:30:33.280
You can't live a day, can you?

00:30:33.520 --> 00:30:35.200
I think you are irresponsible

00:30:35.840 --> 00:30:36.640
for marriage.

00:30:38.680 --> 00:30:39.920
I will

00:30:39.920 --> 00:30:41.680
take good care of my wife.

00:30:42.720 --> 00:30:43.360
You have no idea

00:30:43.360 --> 00:30:44.640
who you're marrying.

00:30:44.760 --> 00:30:45.440
How?

00:30:45.960 --> 00:30:47.000
Nonsense.

00:30:47.280 --> 00:30:48.280
He's a hypocrite.

00:30:48.840 --> 00:30:49.970
What is a hypocrite?

00:30:50.960 --> 00:30:51.960
This hypocrite

00:30:51.960 --> 00:30:54.360
He's just sweet when we first met.

00:30:54.760 --> 00:30:56.680
but he's actually a scum.

00:30:57.360 --> 00:30:57.760
I...

00:30:59.680 --> 00:31:00.680
I'll kill you.

00:31:03.480 --> 00:31:04.600
Look at yourself.

00:31:05.120 --> 00:31:05.640
Every day.

00:31:05.640 --> 00:31:07.360
You don't look like a woman at all.

00:31:07.360 --> 00:31:08.600
Instead of worrying about me,

00:31:08.600 --> 00:31:09.680
you should worry about yourself.

00:31:09.680 --> 00:31:10.940
if you can get married.

00:31:13.960 --> 00:31:15.880
I will be the best woman

00:31:15.960 --> 00:31:17.240
in the Tang Dynasty.

00:31:18.400 --> 00:31:19.800
It's good to have a dream.

00:31:20.040 --> 00:31:21.240
It's not a dream.

00:31:21.600 --> 00:31:24.760
but I know what love is.

00:31:25.400 --> 00:31:27.280
And you don't understand.

00:31:27.720 --> 00:31:29.050
Why don't I understand?

00:31:29.840 --> 00:31:30.600
Love is

00:31:30.920 --> 00:31:32.320
when you see this person,

00:31:32.360 --> 00:31:33.040
your heart

00:31:33.200 --> 00:31:34.880
will flutter.

00:31:35.960 --> 00:31:36.920
But what you've done

00:31:36.920 --> 00:31:38.000
in the past few days,

00:31:38.000 --> 00:31:39.330
I don't even have a heart

00:31:39.400 --> 00:31:40.600
I have no heart at all.

00:31:40.720 --> 00:31:41.680
God

00:31:41.680 --> 00:31:43.040
give you love?

00:31:43.880 --> 00:31:44.240
I...

00:31:47.920 --> 00:31:49.160
Love

00:31:50.840 --> 00:31:52.200
Thump Thump.

00:32:00.400 --> 00:32:01.460
You have to go back.

00:32:06.040 --> 00:32:07.100
For the time being,

00:32:07.200 --> 00:32:09.060
you'll be fine if you don't see me.

00:32:09.160 --> 00:32:10.820
The innocence of my ancestors

00:32:11.240 --> 00:32:12.600
can't be ruined by me.

00:32:18.840 --> 00:32:19.440
Li,

00:32:19.760 --> 00:32:21.440
Hua Xiaochi sent you flowers,

00:32:21.440 --> 00:32:23.500
everyone in Chang'an knows about it.

00:32:23.920 --> 00:32:25.640
Seize the chance, Li.

00:32:28.160 --> 00:32:30.400
My innocence and my reputation...

00:32:31.520 --> 00:32:33.040
I didn't expect this day to come.

00:32:33.040 --> 00:32:34.300
I have to make a choice.

00:32:34.400 --> 00:32:35.000
Like this.

00:32:36.600 --> 00:32:37.960
I'll be in charge of the public opinion.

00:32:37.960 --> 00:32:39.090
and you take action.

00:32:41.280 --> 00:32:42.210
After you leave,

00:32:42.680 --> 00:32:43.960
I will try my best

00:32:44.120 --> 00:32:45.250
stay in the mansion.

00:32:46.920 --> 00:32:47.880
I will try my best

00:32:48.200 --> 00:32:49.280
to make her

00:32:49.280 --> 00:32:50.120
in Chang'an.

00:33:10.760 --> 00:33:11.220
My lord.

00:33:18.360 --> 00:33:18.960
What is it?

00:33:33.760 --> 00:33:34.440
Mr. Bang.

00:33:35.160 --> 00:33:35.920
You're back.

00:33:40.920 --> 00:33:42.780
Why aren't you sleeping at night?

00:33:43.840 --> 00:33:45.240
I'll take this whole yard

00:33:45.280 --> 00:33:46.600
I changed all the flowers

00:33:46.600 --> 00:33:47.660
I changed them all.

00:33:47.960 --> 00:33:49.640
The flowers bloom in early spring.

00:33:49.640 --> 00:33:51.440
It won't be hard for you, will it?

00:33:53.600 --> 00:33:54.200
This is...

00:33:56.600 --> 00:33:58.200
That tree looks good.

00:33:58.400 --> 00:33:59.860
There are many fireflies.

00:33:59.960 --> 00:34:01.820
I want to catch more to make a lamp.

00:34:02.440 --> 00:34:03.170
Is it pretty?

00:34:07.240 --> 00:34:08.100
This is for you.

00:34:12.760 --> 00:34:13.600
This is the first gift

00:34:13.600 --> 00:34:14.480
from me.

00:34:14.760 --> 00:34:15.440
Keep it.

00:34:22.880 --> 00:34:24.159
Rest early today.

00:34:25.000 --> 00:34:26.460
I'll come to you tomorrow.

00:34:38.920 --> 00:34:41.840
Tonight, we are here to discuss something important.

00:34:41.840 --> 00:34:42.719
is how to

00:34:42.719 --> 00:34:44.639
as soon as possible.

00:34:45.239 --> 00:34:46.080
In the next two days,

00:34:46.080 --> 00:34:47.560
in the next two days.

00:34:47.920 --> 00:34:48.719
Yes.

00:34:50.639 --> 00:34:51.440
Did you steal?

00:34:51.800 --> 00:34:52.639
Every day,

00:34:52.639 --> 00:34:54.120
every day.

00:34:54.360 --> 00:34:55.090
Not a little.

00:34:55.560 --> 00:34:56.440
Did you eat it secretly?

00:34:56.440 --> 00:34:56.960
No.

00:34:57.040 --> 00:34:58.120
Eat whatever you cook

00:34:58.120 --> 00:34:59.080
Not picky at all

00:34:59.440 --> 00:35:00.240
After eating

00:35:00.240 --> 00:35:01.520
Clean up the dishes

00:35:01.520 --> 00:35:03.000
and send them here in person.

00:35:03.000 --> 00:35:04.130
Is there any luxury?

00:35:04.280 --> 00:35:06.000
Get up before dawn every day.

00:35:06.320 --> 00:35:08.360
to sweep the floor and water the flowers.

00:35:08.360 --> 00:35:09.560
She's very diligent.

00:35:09.600 --> 00:35:11.880
Did anyone inquire about her background?

00:35:11.880 --> 00:35:13.240
I followed her for a few days.

00:35:13.240 --> 00:35:14.880
I just went to the flower market

00:35:14.880 --> 00:35:16.010
Look at the clothes.

00:35:16.120 --> 00:35:17.040
Heard stories

00:35:17.400 --> 00:35:18.460
Teasing the puppy.

00:35:19.920 --> 00:35:21.040
You have 15 days.

00:35:21.920 --> 00:35:22.980
Either she leaves,

00:35:24.480 --> 00:35:25.400
or you leave.

00:35:27.800 --> 00:35:29.880
My lord, it's all my fault.

00:35:54.160 --> 00:35:54.960
How could she catch

00:35:54.960 --> 00:35:56.040
so many fireflies?

00:36:37.760 --> 00:36:39.480
Why are you in the bedroom?

00:36:39.480 --> 00:36:40.840
in the bedroom?

00:36:43.640 --> 00:36:44.970
What are you doing here?

00:36:45.000 --> 00:36:45.960
Why are you

00:36:46.640 --> 00:36:48.360
install such a big mirror?

00:36:51.600 --> 00:36:52.120
Get out.

00:36:54.000 --> 00:36:56.080
Why is the chairman angry?

00:36:58.920 --> 00:36:59.400
Get out.

00:36:59.440 --> 00:37:00.120
Get out!

00:37:00.400 --> 00:37:00.860
Get out!

00:37:08.520 --> 00:37:09.250
What window?

00:37:10.880 --> 00:37:11.740
The front door.

00:37:20.040 --> 00:37:21.360
If you have time,

00:37:21.640 --> 00:37:22.600
if you have time.

00:37:23.560 --> 00:37:24.440
I brought this

00:37:24.440 --> 00:37:25.320
for you.

00:37:26.000 --> 00:37:28.600
I carefully

00:37:28.720 --> 00:37:30.880
for several days.

00:37:35.760 --> 00:37:37.490
The flower garden in Chang'an.

00:37:38.400 --> 00:37:40.400
The shop has expressed the details.

00:37:42.080 --> 00:37:43.440
I saw the garden outside

00:37:43.440 --> 00:37:44.480
in the garden.

00:37:44.920 --> 00:37:45.960
Flower business

00:37:46.080 --> 00:37:47.480
is very market.

00:37:48.360 --> 00:37:50.960
Do you want to make a fortune together?

00:37:51.520 --> 00:37:53.440
Did you come to my house

00:37:54.360 --> 00:37:55.280
just for this?

00:37:56.520 --> 00:37:57.000
Yes.

00:38:00.120 --> 00:38:01.720
Don't you want to be my woman?

00:38:02.160 --> 00:38:03.120
Of course not.

00:38:03.480 --> 00:38:05.040
I have to focus on my career.

00:38:06.040 --> 00:38:06.840
But

00:38:07.000 --> 00:38:08.960
those sexy bitches outside

00:38:09.280 --> 00:38:10.680
really want to marry you.

00:38:10.960 --> 00:38:13.080
I want to make a big deal with you.

00:38:15.280 --> 00:38:16.410
Playing hard to get.

00:38:19.360 --> 00:38:20.440
I've written it clearly

00:38:20.440 --> 00:38:21.840
I've written it clearly.

00:38:22.240 --> 00:38:23.700
You have time to digest it.

00:38:24.240 --> 00:38:25.100
I'll get going.

00:38:27.960 --> 00:38:30.960
Don't tell anyone.

00:38:31.520 --> 00:38:32.800
about my room.

00:38:33.880 --> 00:38:34.600
What is it?

00:38:35.960 --> 00:38:36.600
Bookcase.

00:38:36.960 --> 00:38:37.620
[Bookcase]

00:38:38.040 --> 00:38:38.800
[Bookcase]

00:38:39.040 --> 00:38:39.640
A book.

00:38:40.320 --> 00:38:42.250
The bronze mirror in the bookcase.

00:38:42.440 --> 00:38:43.700
What's the condition?

00:38:45.720 --> 00:38:46.650
What do you want?

00:38:47.360 --> 00:38:49.440
Read it tomorrow and give a detailed report.

00:38:49.440 --> 00:38:51.170
Let's talk about our thoughts.

00:38:51.440 --> 00:38:52.840
I'll get going. Bye.

00:38:55.840 --> 00:38:57.440
Let's become rich together.

00:38:57.960 --> 00:38:59.480
No one can stop us.

00:39:00.400 --> 00:39:01.000
Goodbye.

00:39:07.440 --> 00:39:08.360
Flowers.

00:39:10.640 --> 00:39:12.040
It's just a small profit.

00:39:21.000 --> 00:39:22.120
Why does Lord Wu

00:39:22.520 --> 00:39:24.800
with the Chamber of Commerce?

00:39:25.720 --> 00:39:26.920
How should I

00:39:27.880 --> 00:39:29.480
watch Noble Lady Street?

00:39:36.720 --> 00:39:37.520
You know what?

00:39:38.120 --> 00:39:39.720
Hua Xiaochi's egg clear water

00:39:39.720 --> 00:39:40.960
is really useful.

00:39:51.880 --> 00:39:52.340
My lord.

00:39:53.440 --> 00:39:53.840
Hurry!

00:40:02.280 --> 00:40:02.640
Go.

00:40:07.760 --> 00:40:09.520
My lord, as long as you don't go through the front door,

00:40:09.520 --> 00:40:10.640
she won't find out.

00:40:11.240 --> 00:40:12.920
Don't worry. I've arranged everything.

00:40:12.920 --> 00:40:14.080
Morning, Mr. Bang.

00:40:14.920 --> 00:40:15.880
I knew

00:40:15.880 --> 00:40:16.960
you wouldn't go through the front door.

00:40:16.960 --> 00:40:17.720
So,

00:40:18.040 --> 00:40:19.770
I came here early in the morning

00:40:20.720 --> 00:40:21.650
waiting for you.

00:40:22.320 --> 00:40:23.840
Are you trying to find out

00:40:23.920 --> 00:40:24.960
Take it to tell stories.

00:40:24.960 --> 00:40:25.880
The story

00:40:26.000 --> 00:40:27.240
is in the past.

00:40:27.360 --> 00:40:28.440
You...

00:40:31.960 --> 00:40:32.560
Sir!

00:40:32.960 --> 00:40:33.560
Chairman!

00:40:36.800 --> 00:40:38.360
Chairman, I'll go with you.

00:40:38.960 --> 00:40:40.000
with you.

00:40:40.160 --> 00:40:41.020
Plant flowers?

00:40:41.960 --> 00:40:42.960
When did I promise you

00:40:42.960 --> 00:40:44.320
to invest in the flower shop?

00:40:44.320 --> 00:40:45.440
Well, I...

00:40:49.160 --> 00:40:51.220
I don't think I should meet you today.

00:40:52.040 --> 00:40:53.040
A meeting at home.

00:40:56.440 --> 00:40:57.300
Chairman Fang.

00:42:06.800 --> 00:42:07.560
Xu Ziqi.

00:42:07.960 --> 00:42:09.440
You've been

00:42:09.640 --> 00:42:11.800
in front of me.

00:42:12.080 --> 00:42:12.960
Are you free

00:42:13.920 --> 00:42:14.600
Yes.

00:42:15.320 --> 00:42:17.320
You don't need to patrol the streets.

00:42:17.320 --> 00:42:19.120
There are many bad people out there.

00:42:19.120 --> 00:42:21.480
My career has collapsed and I'm in low spirits.

00:42:21.480 --> 00:42:23.480
Why don't you just go after the debt?

00:42:27.160 --> 00:42:29.760
Brother, it's not that I want to deny it.

00:42:30.560 --> 00:42:31.600
but you have to let me

00:42:31.600 --> 00:42:32.560
make money

00:42:32.560 --> 00:42:33.820
to pay you back, right?

00:42:34.880 --> 00:42:35.680
To make money.

00:42:36.360 --> 00:42:38.000
Then stop following me.

00:42:38.520 --> 00:42:39.380
Leave me alone.

00:42:39.400 --> 00:42:40.520
Think about it.

00:42:41.960 --> 00:42:42.480
No.

00:42:53.840 --> 00:42:54.560
Looks like

00:42:55.480 --> 00:42:56.880
I don't have to buy flowers.
