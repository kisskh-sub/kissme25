[Glory]

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:32.930
[Episode 25]

00:01:36.400 --> 00:01:37.120
Is that all?

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:40.000
I've been to several
secondhand clothing shops

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:41.479
to gather all these items.

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:43.410
Everything is inside.

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:44.680
My Lord. (Support Admin Watch on
kissasia.cam or kisskh.org)

00:01:45.430 --> 00:01:46.710
Governor Jiang allows his soldiers

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:47.640
to arrest innocent people,

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:49.120
torture them for confessions
and falsely accuse them as thieves.

00:01:49.120 --> 00:01:50.759
This is absolutely intolerable!

00:01:50.759 --> 00:01:52.070
Deploying troops without authorization
and disturbing the peace

00:01:52.070 --> 00:01:52.710
is one crime.

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:54.039
Harming the innocent and falsely accusing
honest people as thieves

00:01:54.039 --> 00:01:54.870
is another offense.

00:01:54.870 --> 00:01:56.039
The people of Linji
are now living in fear,

00:01:56.039 --> 00:01:56.680
and their lives are in turmoil,

00:01:56.680 --> 00:01:57.920
which adds to his crimes.

00:01:57.920 --> 00:01:59.039
The petition has been drafted

00:01:59.039 --> 00:02:00.440
for your review, My Lord.

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:03.070
Alright. Dress up.

00:02:03.400 --> 00:02:04.800
Let's leave the mansion.

00:02:05.760 --> 00:02:07.560
Linji has always been peaceful,

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:09.650
a rare prosperous place in Jiangnan.

00:02:10.030 --> 00:02:11.280
The Rong family contributes

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:12.870
substantial tea taxes
to the court every year.

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:14.750
Now that the Rong family has been robbed,

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:15.680
local officials

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:17.750
are locked in endless accusations
with the imperial Prefect.

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:18.360
His Majesty would never

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:19.630
easily believe just one side.

00:02:19.630 --> 00:02:21.840
The court will surely
send a new imperial envoy.

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:22.800
We must find evidence

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:23.870
before the new imperial envoy

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:24.870
arrives at Linji.

00:02:24.910 --> 00:02:25.710
Otherwise...

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:26.930
Otherwise what?

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:33.030
Otherwise, opposing my superior

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:34.000
means that I,

00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:35.960
your lord, will lose my head.

00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:37.910
Jun Dai,

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:40.120
is that Kaitai Teahouse

00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:41.870
really as busy as you described?

00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:42.670
Young Master,

00:02:42.790 --> 00:02:43.910
that Kaitai Teahouse

00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:45.150
is right by the east gate.

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:46.310
Outside its doors,
there's a constant stream of traffic

00:02:46.310 --> 00:02:47.110
day and night.

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:48.680
All the chief managers in town

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:50.140
like to do business there.

00:02:50.240 --> 00:02:52.440
Fine. Let's go to this Kaitai Teahouse.

00:02:57.870 --> 00:02:58.400
Let's go.

00:02:59.079 --> 00:02:59.560
My Lord,

00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:00.800
this hat doesn't match my outfit.

00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:01.710
Could I have another one?

00:03:01.710 --> 00:03:02.570
Change it then.

00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:14.680
Steward Quan,

00:03:14.910 --> 00:03:16.030
these are the finest goods

00:03:16.030 --> 00:03:17.150
in all of Linji.

00:03:17.310 --> 00:03:19.170
Not usually shown to just anyone.

00:03:19.190 --> 00:03:20.000
Take a look.

00:03:20.710 --> 00:03:21.870
This is quite nice.

00:03:23.710 --> 00:03:25.030
This. This bead.

00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:28.740
The quality is excellent.

00:03:29.190 --> 00:03:30.250
Such a bright bead.

00:03:31.310 --> 00:03:33.310
These rice-sized ones are nothing.

00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:36.280
Have you ever seen ones
the size of pigeon eggs?

00:03:37.470 --> 00:03:38.310
Have you seen them?

00:03:38.310 --> 00:03:39.750
Don't exaggerate too much.

00:03:39.750 --> 00:03:40.470
What did you say?

00:03:40.470 --> 00:03:42.530
-What did you say?
-You’ve seen them?

00:03:44.120 --> 00:03:46.190
These items are inauspicious.

00:03:46.750 --> 00:03:49.470
I'll take all the rest.

00:03:51.310 --> 00:03:52.750
Wonderful!

00:03:52.750 --> 00:03:54.240
Really? So many?

00:03:54.240 --> 00:03:54.900
Wonderful!

00:03:55.680 --> 00:03:56.560
How generous!

00:04:01.280 --> 00:04:01.910
Steward,

00:04:02.120 --> 00:04:04.030
I have some excellent goods in my shop.

00:04:04.030 --> 00:04:05.430
I'll send someone
to fetch them right away.

00:04:05.430 --> 00:04:07.240
Would you honor us by taking a look?

00:04:07.240 --> 00:04:08.590
Bring them quickly for me to see.

00:04:08.590 --> 00:04:09.520
Yes, certainly.

00:04:10.800 --> 00:04:12.280
I have more!

00:04:13.310 --> 00:04:14.150
Look at mine!

00:04:15.870 --> 00:04:16.680
Don't push!

00:04:17.310 --> 00:04:18.510
I have more items too!

00:04:56.240 --> 00:04:57.159
From Xiu Qiong?

00:04:57.820 --> 00:04:58.620
Miss Xiu Qiong

00:04:58.650 --> 00:05:00.190
was worried about the poor prison food

00:05:00.190 --> 00:05:00.950
and specially prepared this meal

00:05:00.950 --> 00:05:02.210
for you, Lady Shanbao.

00:05:02.240 --> 00:05:03.570
Miss Xiu Qiong also said

00:05:03.830 --> 00:05:06.070
Lady Yunyin made a scene
at the Rong Mansion gate

00:05:06.070 --> 00:05:07.200
and was driven away.

00:05:07.720 --> 00:05:09.580
She's been depressed ever since.

00:05:10.190 --> 00:05:11.790
Miss Yi sent a message saying

00:05:11.870 --> 00:05:13.190
Lady Yunxi and Lady Xiangling

00:05:13.190 --> 00:05:14.240
have both entered the plantation.

00:05:14.240 --> 00:05:15.070
They're urgently recruiting workers

00:05:15.070 --> 00:05:16.720
to ensure the tribute tea
is shipped on time.

00:05:16.720 --> 00:05:18.360
Please don't worry, Lady Shanbao.

00:05:18.360 --> 00:05:19.160
I understand.

00:05:20.070 --> 00:05:21.870
Good thing you left when you did.

00:05:22.040 --> 00:05:23.900
I heard you've become a clerk now.

00:05:25.870 --> 00:05:27.600
Lady Shanbao, if you hadn't
been so generous

00:05:27.600 --> 00:05:29.180
and released me from servitude,

00:05:29.180 --> 00:05:31.310
I wouldn't have my current prospects.

00:05:31.940 --> 00:05:33.680
Father just came yesterday to tell me

00:05:33.680 --> 00:05:34.800
he's been promoted to estate manager

00:05:34.800 --> 00:05:36.130
with a salary increase.

00:05:36.310 --> 00:05:36.870
My sister

00:05:36.870 --> 00:05:38.670
can now work in the tea house too.

00:05:38.720 --> 00:05:39.800
Our entire family,

00:05:40.040 --> 00:05:41.730
young and old,
relies on your care, Lady Shanbao.

00:05:41.730 --> 00:05:43.990
We'll never forget your great kindness.

00:05:58.870 --> 00:06:00.000
Let me ask you again,

00:06:00.040 --> 00:06:00.920
when will you give me

00:06:00.920 --> 00:06:02.920
the travel permit to leave the city?

00:06:02.950 --> 00:06:04.560
Don't worry. Don't worry.

00:06:04.560 --> 00:06:06.040
Things are very tense these days.

00:06:06.040 --> 00:06:06.830
Just stay here calmly

00:06:06.830 --> 00:06:07.720
and hide for a while.

00:06:07.720 --> 00:06:08.920
Bullshit!

00:06:09.160 --> 00:06:11.040
If the case drags on for a year or more,

00:06:11.040 --> 00:06:12.120
I and my brothers

00:06:12.120 --> 00:06:13.560
will be trapped here like prisoners.

00:06:13.560 --> 00:06:15.560
Even a good man would be driven mad here!

00:06:15.560 --> 00:06:17.160
I might as well kill you first

00:06:17.430 --> 00:06:18.830
and be done with it!

00:06:20.310 --> 00:06:22.630
-You...
-If you really kill me now,

00:06:23.750 --> 00:06:24.830
I guarantee you

00:06:24.830 --> 00:06:26.690
will never leave this city alive.

00:06:27.830 --> 00:06:28.310
Let go!

00:06:28.800 --> 00:06:29.560
Let go!

00:06:43.270 --> 00:06:45.310
Alright. Alright.

00:06:45.870 --> 00:06:47.200
Just be patient for now.

00:06:47.790 --> 00:06:49.120
In another month or two,

00:06:49.270 --> 00:06:51.270
I'll help you leave the city safely.

00:06:51.680 --> 00:06:53.430
By then, with treasures in hand,

00:06:53.430 --> 00:06:55.430
you'll have wealth beyond measure.

00:06:55.830 --> 00:06:56.560
That jade tea set alone

00:06:56.560 --> 00:06:57.680
in Old Madam Rong's room

00:06:57.680 --> 00:06:59.390
would keep you fed for 2 years.

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:02.060
Small impatience ruins great plans.

00:07:04.240 --> 00:07:05.510
Can that powerful person

00:07:05.510 --> 00:07:06.710
behind you really...

00:07:07.310 --> 00:07:08.510
Cannot be discussed.

00:07:11.310 --> 00:07:11.680
Fine.

00:07:32.310 --> 00:07:32.870
Boss.

00:07:35.120 --> 00:07:36.560
I sent you to gather information,

00:07:36.560 --> 00:07:38.159
but you've been gone so long.

00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:40.040
If you're tired of living,

00:07:40.040 --> 00:07:41.440
I'll finish you right now

00:07:41.600 --> 00:07:42.930
to avoid trouble later.

00:07:43.190 --> 00:07:44.600
Boss, have mercy!

00:07:44.750 --> 00:07:45.510
We're not like

00:07:45.510 --> 00:07:47.110
that spineless Yang fellow.

00:07:47.120 --> 00:07:48.070
We've weathered

00:07:48.070 --> 00:07:48.830
many storms.

00:07:48.830 --> 00:07:51.190
These few soldiers can't scare us.

00:07:51.430 --> 00:07:51.870
Boss.

00:07:52.480 --> 00:07:52.920
Boss.

00:07:54.600 --> 00:07:55.120
Boss.

00:07:55.600 --> 00:07:57.040
We risk our heads doing business.

00:07:57.040 --> 00:07:58.070
We don't fear scars on our necks.

00:07:58.070 --> 00:07:59.600
We only fear not selling our goods.

00:07:59.600 --> 00:08:00.070
Boss.

00:08:00.310 --> 00:08:01.430
I found a big buyer.

00:08:01.460 --> 00:08:02.140
A big buyer.

00:08:03.750 --> 00:08:06.190
Selling now? Are you looking to die?

00:08:06.310 --> 00:08:06.800
Boss.

00:08:06.950 --> 00:08:07.830
I've selected

00:08:07.830 --> 00:08:09.290
only unmarked treasures,

00:08:09.430 --> 00:08:11.160
and the gold items
have already been melted down.

00:08:11.160 --> 00:08:12.510
We'll find a middleman then.

00:08:12.510 --> 00:08:13.520
I'm sure the officials

00:08:13.520 --> 00:08:15.320
can't trace anything back to us.

00:08:19.270 --> 00:08:20.130
Is it reliable?

00:08:22.800 --> 00:08:22.980
Scent pouches! Fragrant sachets!

Candied haws!

00:08:28.630 --> 00:08:31.800
Candied haws here!

00:08:34.960 --> 00:08:35.510
Go!

00:08:35.750 --> 00:08:36.809
What's happening?

00:08:47.870 --> 00:08:48.670
Lady Shanbao.

00:08:49.120 --> 00:08:50.920
My lord requests your presence.

00:09:05.910 --> 00:09:06.550
What?

00:09:07.440 --> 00:09:09.240
Lord Lu, you want to
interrogate me tonight?

00:09:09.240 --> 00:09:11.110
Yes, I'm going to interrogate you.

00:09:11.110 --> 00:09:13.630
But considering our past relationship,

00:09:14.320 --> 00:09:16.850
you can choose
your own torture instruments.

00:09:21.510 --> 00:09:22.120
Come here.

00:09:24.080 --> 00:09:24.880
Come here now.

00:09:47.630 --> 00:09:49.090
See if you recognize this.

00:10:02.390 --> 00:10:03.790
It's my family heirloom.

00:10:08.550 --> 00:10:10.550
It's just an ordinary jade pendant,

00:10:10.720 --> 00:10:12.250
commonly found in markets,

00:10:15.320 --> 00:10:17.200
to wear jade pendants as earrings,

00:10:17.200 --> 00:10:18.660
but this one is different.

00:10:18.870 --> 00:10:20.080
One of my ancestors

00:10:20.480 --> 00:10:22.720
was shot in the right eye
on the battlefield.

00:10:22.720 --> 00:10:23.480
When he was buried,

00:10:23.480 --> 00:10:25.480
this jade pendant
was placed in his eye socket,

00:10:25.480 --> 00:10:26.270
in the hope he would be

00:10:26.270 --> 00:10:27.870
whole again in the next life.

00:10:28.080 --> 00:10:30.340
Later, a flash flood collapsed the tomb,

00:10:30.600 --> 00:10:31.800
and this jade pendant

00:10:31.960 --> 00:10:33.790
eventually came into
my grandmother's possession.

00:10:33.790 --> 00:10:35.390
She's kept it all these years.

00:10:35.390 --> 00:10:36.940
I couldn't possibly mistake it.

00:10:36.940 --> 00:10:38.070
If the owner says so,

00:10:38.150 --> 00:10:39.280
then it must be true.

00:10:40.270 --> 00:10:41.580
These cunning bandits

00:10:41.890 --> 00:10:43.350
took only ordinary items,

00:10:43.390 --> 00:10:45.390
thinking they could fool everyone.

00:10:46.510 --> 00:10:48.440
You caught the thieves so quickly?

00:10:51.480 --> 00:10:52.080
Listen.

00:10:54.090 --> 00:10:55.060
Injustice!

00:10:55.630 --> 00:10:58.630
The officials are wrongly
accusing innocent people!

00:10:58.910 --> 00:11:00.160
Injustice!

00:11:00.960 --> 00:11:01.720
Injustice!

00:11:01.840 --> 00:11:04.840
The officials are wrongly
accusing innocent people!

00:11:05.790 --> 00:11:06.440
My Lord.

00:11:09.480 --> 00:11:11.200
It's him! It's him!

00:11:11.550 --> 00:11:12.630
The gold and jade in that box

00:11:12.630 --> 00:11:13.760
were brought by him.

00:11:14.150 --> 00:11:15.270
The precious gems

00:11:15.270 --> 00:11:16.330
were all pried out.

00:11:16.870 --> 00:11:18.440
So you're a master thief!

00:11:18.550 --> 00:11:19.750
You've ruined me!

00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:21.080
My Lord, please see clearly.

00:11:21.080 --> 00:11:22.600
You must bring me justice!

00:11:24.380 --> 00:11:26.440
I travel far and wide doing business,

00:11:26.630 --> 00:11:29.090
collecting gold and gems
through hard work.

00:11:29.240 --> 00:11:31.840
This dishonest merchant
tried to lowball me,

00:11:31.910 --> 00:11:34.030
and when I refused,
he accused me of being a thief.

00:11:34.030 --> 00:11:34.550
You

00:11:34.550 --> 00:11:36.510
shameless bastard!

00:11:37.320 --> 00:11:38.650
My Lord, this is unjust!

00:11:38.910 --> 00:11:40.550
I'm innocent, My Lord!

00:11:40.960 --> 00:11:42.200
Continue beating him.

00:11:42.200 --> 00:11:42.600
Yes.

00:11:43.720 --> 00:11:45.980
You're killing an innocent man, My Lord!

00:11:52.150 --> 00:11:52.720
My Lord,

00:11:53.120 --> 00:11:55.850
He Cifu refuses to confess
even if it means death.

00:11:56.480 --> 00:11:57.630
My grandmother is bedridden after a stroke

00:11:57.630 --> 00:11:58.630
and cannot speak.

00:11:59.150 --> 00:12:00.480
I'm already a prisoner,

00:12:00.900 --> 00:12:02.700
so my testimony isn't credible.

00:12:03.120 --> 00:12:05.050
If you can't make the thieves talk,

00:12:05.630 --> 00:12:07.230
how will you solve this case?

00:12:08.720 --> 00:12:09.320
My Lord,

00:12:09.440 --> 00:12:11.080
these thieves are extremely cunning.

00:12:11.080 --> 00:12:12.270
They're hiding separately

00:12:12.270 --> 00:12:13.790
and can't be caught all at once.

00:12:13.790 --> 00:12:14.670
Even those two

00:12:15.150 --> 00:12:15.750
were only caught

00:12:15.750 --> 00:12:17.030
while they were trading
with the jewelry shop,

00:12:17.030 --> 00:12:18.510
when we quietly apprehended them.

00:12:18.510 --> 00:12:19.960
I fear if we delay too long,

00:12:19.960 --> 00:12:21.820
the rest of the bandits will flee.

00:12:23.490 --> 00:12:25.150
It's the first watch already.

00:12:29.050 --> 00:12:31.850
Caught red-handed
yet still refusing to confess.

00:12:32.120 --> 00:12:34.200
They must have powerful backing.

00:12:35.320 --> 00:12:37.750
Well, encountering these vicious

00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:39.260
and heinous criminals

00:12:39.790 --> 00:12:41.720
gives me a chance to show my skills.

00:12:42.830 --> 00:12:44.630
Before the third watch tonight,

00:12:44.630 --> 00:12:46.030
I will make those bandits

00:12:46.440 --> 00:12:48.570
voluntarily confess to their crimes.

00:12:53.790 --> 00:12:54.960
You said it yourself

00:12:56.270 --> 00:12:58.570
that you believe I can
distinguish right from wrong

00:12:58.570 --> 00:13:00.430
and give justice to the innocent.

00:13:02.960 --> 00:13:05.020
How could I possibly disappoint you?

00:13:16.360 --> 00:13:17.620
Then I'll wait and see.

00:13:23.000 --> 00:13:23.790
Water.

00:13:24.870 --> 00:13:27.200
I need water.

00:13:28.480 --> 00:13:30.240
I need water.

00:13:30.720 --> 00:13:33.100
What are you yelling
about in the middle of the night?

00:13:33.100 --> 00:13:34.050
Until you sign,

00:13:34.080 --> 00:13:35.670
you won't get a drop of water.

00:13:35.670 --> 00:13:37.600
Keep yelling and I'll cut out your tongue.

00:13:37.600 --> 00:13:40.120
The officials are wronging
an innocent man!

00:13:40.120 --> 00:13:41.050
Shut your mouth!

00:13:43.870 --> 00:13:46.480
Mr. Xu, give him some water.

00:13:46.960 --> 00:13:48.550
Then we'll all have some peace.

00:13:48.550 --> 00:13:50.940
So he won't make a racket
in the middle of the night.

00:13:50.940 --> 00:13:51.980
It's so annoying.

00:14:01.600 --> 00:14:02.080
You...

00:14:03.230 --> 00:14:05.490
If you want to live, don't ask questions.

00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:08.240
Hurry, put on his clothes.

00:14:08.240 --> 00:14:09.920
I'll lead you out of the city
under cover of darkness.

00:14:09.920 --> 00:14:11.150
Someone will meet you
in the west of the city.

00:14:11.150 --> 00:14:12.480
I knew Mr. Yang

00:14:12.720 --> 00:14:13.850
would keep his word.

00:14:14.200 --> 00:14:15.120
That patron of his

00:14:15.120 --> 00:14:16.200
truly has incredible

00:14:16.200 --> 00:14:16.960
influence.

00:14:19.000 --> 00:14:19.930
Where's my man?

00:14:21.240 --> 00:14:23.040
Everything's arranged. Hurry!

00:14:27.870 --> 00:14:28.870
I'll go check ahead.

00:14:28.870 --> 00:14:30.070
Don't wander around.

00:14:31.240 --> 00:14:31.770
Let's go.

00:14:36.080 --> 00:14:36.960
As if they

00:14:36.960 --> 00:14:38.150
could make me talk.

00:14:38.530 --> 00:14:40.030
I fear neither fire nor water,

00:14:40.030 --> 00:14:41.160
nor blade nor spear!

00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:48.550
This way.

00:15:21.630 --> 00:15:23.960
The two ringleaders know they are sinful.

00:15:24.670 --> 00:15:26.270
They assaulted the guards late at night

00:15:26.270 --> 00:15:27.670
and escaped from prison.

00:15:27.980 --> 00:15:30.200
They can be executed immediately
according to the law.

00:15:30.200 --> 00:15:31.530
Execute them on the spot

00:15:32.000 --> 00:15:33.790
to set the public's mind at ease.

00:15:33.790 --> 00:15:34.510
No, no, no!

00:15:34.630 --> 00:15:35.840
You haven't even tried
my case in court yet!

00:15:35.840 --> 00:15:37.250
You... You can't kill me!

00:15:37.550 --> 00:15:38.960
Before, you were a suspect,

00:15:38.960 --> 00:15:40.870
so naturally you needed to be questioned.

00:15:40.870 --> 00:15:42.720
Now you're an escaped prisoner.

00:15:43.120 --> 00:15:44.850
What's wrong with killing you?

00:15:45.030 --> 00:15:45.670
Do it.

00:15:50.190 --> 00:15:51.120
I'll talk! I'll talk!

00:15:51.120 --> 00:15:52.910
I'll confess everything!

00:15:53.360 --> 00:15:54.560
Please don't kill me!

00:15:58.270 --> 00:16:00.480
It was... It was Yang Yitang.

00:16:00.630 --> 00:16:02.150
He approached me first for the deal.

00:16:02.150 --> 00:16:03.960
He said he had powerful backing.

00:16:03.960 --> 00:16:06.280
That if we were caught by officials,
it wouldn't matter.

00:16:06.280 --> 00:16:07.560
Someone would save me.

00:16:09.440 --> 00:16:12.170
So there really is
a powerful patron behind this.

00:16:12.550 --> 00:16:13.120
However, I had already

00:16:13.120 --> 00:16:14.480
suspected all of this.

00:16:15.030 --> 00:16:16.890
No need for your redundant words.

00:16:16.960 --> 00:16:17.440
Jun Dai.

00:16:18.550 --> 00:16:19.030
I know

00:16:19.030 --> 00:16:21.170
where that Yang fellow is hiding!

00:16:21.200 --> 00:16:23.510
Please, My Lord, don't kill me!

00:16:26.120 --> 00:16:28.870
It's the third watch already.

00:16:39.670 --> 00:16:40.600
Coming, coming!

00:16:43.910 --> 00:16:44.790
Who are you people?

00:16:44.790 --> 00:16:45.390
Seize him!

00:16:46.320 --> 00:16:46.960
Everyone,

00:16:47.270 --> 00:16:48.330
what are you doing?

00:16:51.200 --> 00:16:51.860
Don't move!

00:16:53.960 --> 00:16:54.960
Search the place!

00:17:01.480 --> 00:17:03.390
Who are you people anyway?

00:17:03.840 --> 00:17:04.750
My Lord, there's no one inside.

00:17:04.750 --> 00:17:05.950
Nothing here either.

00:17:08.400 --> 00:17:09.300
The suspect climbed
over the wall and escaped.

00:17:09.300 --> 00:17:09.849
After him!

00:17:09.849 --> 00:17:10.380
Yes, sir!

00:17:10.569 --> 00:17:12.230
The fugitive is ahead! Hurry!

00:17:22.200 --> 00:17:23.800
I'll wait until five at most.

00:17:24.190 --> 00:17:25.640
Please pass on my message.

00:17:25.640 --> 00:17:27.099
If I don't see Lady Yunshu,

00:17:27.310 --> 00:17:29.240
then I'll meet her at Chongxi Hall.

00:17:38.720 --> 00:17:41.400
Lady Yunshu, Mr. Bai is...

00:17:44.720 --> 00:17:45.520
You may leave.

00:18:00.450 --> 00:18:01.800
Why have you come here?

00:18:03.070 --> 00:18:04.800
Lu Jianglai is hunting me down.

00:18:05.110 --> 00:18:07.030
You need to help me leave Linji quickly.

00:18:07.030 --> 00:18:08.760
Your patron has abandoned you,

00:18:09.030 --> 00:18:10.750
so now you come to me seeking refuge?

00:18:10.750 --> 00:18:12.240
Lady Yunshu, you're mistaken.

00:18:12.240 --> 00:18:13.840
I'm not here seeking refuge.

00:18:14.110 --> 00:18:15.840
After all, we were once allies.

00:18:16.070 --> 00:18:17.070
If I'm captured,

00:18:17.510 --> 00:18:18.110
I'm afraid you

00:18:18.110 --> 00:18:19.910
won't have a good ending either.

00:18:20.590 --> 00:18:21.920
You're threatening me?

00:18:22.790 --> 00:18:23.920
I'm just helping you see

00:18:23.920 --> 00:18:25.720
the current situation clearly.

00:18:28.310 --> 00:18:29.510
You just said

00:18:30.400 --> 00:18:32.200
Lu Jianglai is hunting you down.

00:18:32.640 --> 00:18:34.240
You escaped from him?

00:18:34.350 --> 00:18:37.000
That's right. Before he discovers me,

00:18:37.550 --> 00:18:39.280
help me leave the city quickly.

00:18:49.200 --> 00:18:50.330
I deliberately left

00:18:50.680 --> 00:18:52.280
one side of this trap net open

00:18:52.590 --> 00:18:53.270
so Yang Yitang could go

00:18:53.270 --> 00:18:54.730
where he's supposed to go.

00:18:55.960 --> 00:18:56.720
Where?

00:18:57.200 --> 00:18:59.400
I have men watching
the Provincial Governor's Office.

00:18:59.400 --> 00:19:00.090
If Jiang Yiqian

00:19:00.090 --> 00:19:01.220
is truly his patron,

00:19:01.500 --> 00:19:02.500
then he must be

00:19:02.520 --> 00:19:04.160
caught at
the Provincial Governor's Office.

00:19:04.160 --> 00:19:06.420
That would be catching them red-handed.

00:19:08.220 --> 00:19:09.170
You people

00:19:09.640 --> 00:19:10.790
are so cunning.

00:19:11.730 --> 00:19:12.340
What if he doesn't dare

00:19:12.340 --> 00:19:13.960
go to the Provincial Governor's Office?

00:19:13.960 --> 00:19:14.750
Then he must have

00:19:14.750 --> 00:19:16.200
other accomplices in the city.

00:19:16.200 --> 00:19:18.400
Catching them all would be convenient.

00:19:19.550 --> 00:19:20.750
I suspect this person

00:19:23.590 --> 00:19:24.880
might be at...

00:19:25.510 --> 00:19:26.240
Where?

00:19:28.400 --> 00:19:29.830
My Lord, that Yang fellow

00:19:29.830 --> 00:19:31.760
is heading toward the Rong family.

00:19:36.790 --> 00:19:37.400
My Lord,

00:19:38.470 --> 00:19:40.200
since the trouble is at my home,

00:19:40.240 --> 00:19:42.240
please allow me to capture them myself

00:19:42.240 --> 00:19:43.500
to prove my innocence.

00:19:46.070 --> 00:19:48.110
You're afraid I might
let the criminal escape

00:19:48.110 --> 00:19:49.510
and implicate yourself?

00:19:53.750 --> 00:19:55.210
Now that I'm useful to you,

00:19:55.270 --> 00:19:56.440
Lady Shanbao,

00:19:56.830 --> 00:19:58.630
you're finally being nice to me.

00:19:59.030 --> 00:20:00.090
I fear that someday

00:20:00.270 --> 00:20:01.750
when you clear your name,

00:20:02.400 --> 00:20:04.400
you'll throw me over the wall again.

00:20:05.750 --> 00:20:06.510
I won't.

00:20:08.650 --> 00:20:09.910
You're not lying to me?

00:20:13.850 --> 00:20:15.850
Fine, I believe you.

00:20:33.350 --> 00:20:35.790
But Lady Shanbao, don't be impatient.

00:20:36.640 --> 00:20:38.840
It's better to catch someone in the act.

00:20:57.640 --> 00:20:59.040
You've made up your mind?

00:20:59.640 --> 00:21:01.030
You used threats and inducements.

00:21:01.030 --> 00:21:02.160
How could I not come?

00:21:15.310 --> 00:21:16.370
Are you reluctant?

00:21:18.600 --> 00:21:19.550
What you're asking me to give up

00:21:19.550 --> 00:21:20.680
is wealth and status,

00:21:20.680 --> 00:21:22.960
and the noble identity
of Lady Rong Yunshu.

00:21:22.960 --> 00:21:24.270
Even if I'm reluctant,
what difference does it make?

00:21:24.270 --> 00:21:25.600
Would you let me go back?

00:21:27.270 --> 00:21:29.400
The luggage and boat have been waiting

00:21:30.270 --> 00:21:31.670
at the dock for some time.

00:21:39.680 --> 00:21:40.400
Let's go.

00:22:09.440 --> 00:22:12.070
Yunshu, don't be mad at me.

00:22:13.440 --> 00:22:15.200
After the spring examination is over,

00:22:15.200 --> 00:22:16.260
I'll bring you back

00:22:16.750 --> 00:22:18.410
to apologize to Grandmother.

00:22:18.490 --> 00:22:19.350
You're just afraid I might

00:22:19.350 --> 00:22:21.070
poison that wicked old woman.

00:22:21.510 --> 00:22:22.550
That's why you're in such a hurry

00:22:22.550 --> 00:22:23.650
to force me to leave,

00:22:23.650 --> 00:22:25.380
not even daring to say goodbye.

00:22:25.920 --> 00:22:27.680
Now that things have come to this,

00:22:27.680 --> 00:22:29.540
why still pretend to be virtuous?

00:22:34.550 --> 00:22:36.640
I know you talk tough
but have a soft heart.

00:22:36.640 --> 00:22:37.550
You certainly wouldn't do

00:22:37.550 --> 00:22:39.280
something so unconscionable.

00:22:40.160 --> 00:22:40.750
Yunshu.

00:22:41.920 --> 00:22:43.510
You've been mad at me the whole way.

00:22:43.510 --> 00:22:44.770
Have some water first.

00:22:59.270 --> 00:23:00.070
You're wrong.

00:23:02.480 --> 00:23:03.110
What?

00:23:07.070 --> 00:23:07.830
Come out.

00:23:28.960 --> 00:23:30.510
Don't move, Mr. Bai.

00:23:30.880 --> 00:23:32.790
This boat is small and the river is deep.

00:23:32.790 --> 00:23:35.070
Fall in and your body will never be found.

00:23:40.270 --> 00:23:41.670
You agreed to come with me

00:23:42.590 --> 00:23:44.030
just to help him escape?

00:23:48.780 --> 00:23:49.650
Lady Yunshu and I

00:23:49.650 --> 00:23:50.980
are on the same side.

00:23:51.720 --> 00:23:53.110
If you're smart,

00:23:53.440 --> 00:23:55.110
you should know your place.

00:24:03.750 --> 00:24:04.640
Don't you know

00:24:04.640 --> 00:24:06.040
what kind of person he is?

00:24:06.160 --> 00:24:06.880
How could you

00:24:06.880 --> 00:24:08.140
get involved with him?

00:24:09.160 --> 00:24:10.350
Did he threaten you?

00:24:16.750 --> 00:24:18.410
You're no different from him.

00:24:19.040 --> 00:24:20.640
You're both threatening me.

00:24:24.140 --> 00:24:26.690
Don't worry. Once I'm safe,

00:24:27.750 --> 00:24:29.440
I'll naturally be discreet

00:24:29.880 --> 00:24:32.610
and won't make things
difficult for Lady Yunshu.

00:24:48.510 --> 00:24:49.440
You poisoned me.

00:25:05.960 --> 00:25:08.620
I despise being threatened
more than anything.

00:25:09.470 --> 00:25:10.430
My life

00:25:11.400 --> 00:25:12.160
must remain

00:25:12.160 --> 00:25:13.350
in my own hands.

00:25:33.200 --> 00:25:34.800
Hasn't Lord Lu caught up yet?

00:25:34.960 --> 00:25:36.960
-Lady Yunshu, no sign of him.
-Fine.

00:25:37.200 --> 00:25:38.860
You dare to scheme against me.

00:25:39.240 --> 00:25:41.300
Then don't expect to get away with it.

00:26:25.360 --> 00:26:26.160
Yunshu.

00:26:38.030 --> 00:26:39.200
You'll keep it a secret,

00:26:39.200 --> 00:26:39.880
right?

00:26:41.160 --> 00:26:43.020
I'll send you back to the capital.

00:26:43.400 --> 00:26:44.830
You'll swallow

00:26:45.480 --> 00:26:47.200
what you know, okay?

00:26:53.030 --> 00:26:53.680
No.

00:26:55.830 --> 00:26:57.720
I want you to leave with me.

00:27:05.680 --> 00:27:06.400
I told you,

00:27:07.920 --> 00:27:09.920
I hate being threatened most of all.

00:28:11.750 --> 00:28:13.550
I don't know how I offended him.

00:28:14.130 --> 00:28:15.640
Last night he broke into my house

00:28:15.640 --> 00:28:17.440
and forced me to help him escape.

00:28:17.790 --> 00:28:19.720
Fortunately, I'm always cautious

00:28:19.860 --> 00:28:21.460
and carry sedatives with me,

00:28:21.750 --> 00:28:23.280
so I was able to capture him.

00:28:25.640 --> 00:28:27.770
Such a villain disrupts public order.

00:28:28.160 --> 00:28:30.560
I hope you'll punish him
properly, Lord Lu.

00:28:30.790 --> 00:28:31.390
Of course.

00:28:36.920 --> 00:28:38.250
Where is Bai Yingsheng?

00:28:41.510 --> 00:28:43.000
Bai tried to protect me

00:28:44.110 --> 00:28:46.640
but was thrown into
the water by this villain.

00:28:46.830 --> 00:28:49.030
I've been searching but found nothing.

00:28:49.720 --> 00:28:50.480
Now that I've handed the criminal over

00:28:50.480 --> 00:28:51.400
to you, Lord Lu,

00:28:52.030 --> 00:28:53.890
I'll continue searching for Bai.

00:29:19.790 --> 00:29:20.750
Get more people

00:29:21.480 --> 00:29:23.030
to search for Bai Yingsheng.

00:29:23.030 --> 00:29:23.880
Yes, My Lord.

00:29:29.960 --> 00:29:30.490
Let's go.

00:29:34.510 --> 00:29:35.270
This sister of yours

00:29:35.270 --> 00:29:36.680
is truly extraordinary.

00:29:37.480 --> 00:29:39.140
I fear she already saw through

00:29:39.160 --> 00:29:41.070
my intentional release of Yang Yitang,

00:29:41.070 --> 00:29:42.070
so she deliberately planned

00:29:42.070 --> 00:29:43.400
to hand over Yang Yitang

00:29:43.470 --> 00:29:45.200
to clear herself of suspicion.

00:29:45.540 --> 00:29:47.600
If Yang Yitang implicates her later,

00:29:47.830 --> 00:29:49.030
it will only be seen as

00:29:49.110 --> 00:29:50.640
an act of personal revenge.

00:29:50.750 --> 00:29:51.590
She managed to stay in Rong Mansion,

00:29:51.590 --> 00:29:53.790
keeping a low profile for over a decade.

00:29:54.030 --> 00:29:56.060
She's certainly no ordinary person.

00:29:56.060 --> 00:29:56.890
I won't let any of those

00:29:56.890 --> 00:29:58.750
involved in this case off easily.

00:29:59.680 --> 00:30:01.720
Bai Yingsheng's fate remains unknown.

00:30:01.720 --> 00:30:03.780
This case will not be closed hastily.

00:30:05.270 --> 00:30:06.330
Come to think of it,

00:30:07.640 --> 00:30:08.240
you two have been

00:30:08.240 --> 00:30:09.700
sisters for over a decade.

00:30:09.920 --> 00:30:11.380
If she remains obstinate,

00:30:12.070 --> 00:30:14.270
could you bear to take action yourself?

00:30:25.280 --> 00:30:26.170
[Imperial Inspector Luo Deze,
newly appointed by the Court,]

00:30:26.170 --> 00:30:27.060
[will arrive in Linji tomorrow.
All preparations are in place.]

00:30:28.960 --> 00:30:29.510
My Lord,

00:30:30.030 --> 00:30:31.310
the new Imperial Inspector
sent by the court

00:30:31.310 --> 00:30:33.040
will arrive in Linji tomorrow.

00:30:38.200 --> 00:30:39.240
Bind him first.

00:30:39.920 --> 00:30:42.250
I will interrogate him through the night.

00:31:07.030 --> 00:31:08.630
This case is no small matter.

00:31:08.880 --> 00:31:10.720
It involves the Emperor's
beloved officials.

00:31:10.720 --> 00:31:13.680
It's not something that can be easily
handled by local authorities.

00:31:13.680 --> 00:31:16.010
Please, Lord Luo, make a decisive action.

00:31:16.270 --> 00:31:17.670
Please immediately send

00:31:17.790 --> 00:31:18.960
a memorial to the imperial court,

00:31:18.960 --> 00:31:20.220
requesting judgment.

00:31:21.000 --> 00:31:21.550
My Lord.

00:31:23.240 --> 00:31:25.240
My Lord, Prefect Lu Jianglai
requests an audience.

00:31:25.240 --> 00:31:25.970
Good timing.

00:31:26.310 --> 00:31:27.310
If he hadn't come,

00:31:27.540 --> 00:31:29.870
I would have sent someone to question him.

00:31:30.640 --> 00:31:31.470
Bring him in.

00:31:31.990 --> 00:31:32.510
Yes.

00:31:40.270 --> 00:31:42.640
Lord Luo, forgive me
for not greeting you properly.

00:31:42.640 --> 00:31:44.550
My Lord, you carry
a heavy responsibility on this visit.

00:31:44.550 --> 00:31:46.070
Let's skip the pleasantries.

00:31:46.070 --> 00:31:47.240
Once the case is resolved,

00:31:47.240 --> 00:31:49.440
I will host a welcoming banquet for you.

00:31:49.590 --> 00:31:51.320
Guards, bring in the prisoner!

00:32:00.440 --> 00:32:01.240
Lord Lu!

00:32:02.400 --> 00:32:03.930
What is the meaning of this?

00:32:04.070 --> 00:32:05.270
You're conducting a trial

00:32:05.270 --> 00:32:06.860
in the Provincial Governor's Office?

00:32:06.860 --> 00:32:08.520
Lord Jiang, please calm down.

00:32:08.750 --> 00:32:09.310
Lord Luo,

00:32:09.880 --> 00:32:10.750
He Cifu is the real

00:32:10.750 --> 00:32:12.350
ringleader who robbed the Rong Mansion.

00:32:12.350 --> 00:32:13.590
The remaining 16 criminals

00:32:13.590 --> 00:32:14.920
have all been captured.

00:32:15.310 --> 00:32:16.160
He confessed that

00:32:16.160 --> 00:32:18.030
he was acting under orders
from the corrupt merchant Yang Yitang

00:32:18.030 --> 00:32:20.350
and secretly hid stolen weapons
in the tea plantation

00:32:20.350 --> 00:32:21.790
to frame Rong Shanbao.

00:32:22.480 --> 00:32:23.210
Yang Yitang,

00:32:23.480 --> 00:32:24.740
repeat what you told me

00:32:24.740 --> 00:32:26.310
to the Imperial Inspector.

00:32:30.750 --> 00:32:32.480
All the stolen goods have been found.

00:32:32.480 --> 00:32:34.220
If you don't
name the mastermind behind this,

00:32:34.220 --> 00:32:35.560
you alone will bear

00:32:35.590 --> 00:32:36.570
the serious crimes of murder, robbery,

00:32:36.570 --> 00:32:38.440
and falsely accusing the innocent.

00:32:38.440 --> 00:32:40.170
You'd better think carefully.

00:32:48.960 --> 00:32:50.160
Imperial Inspector,

00:32:50.640 --> 00:32:52.240
I don't have the guts.

00:32:52.350 --> 00:32:53.080
It was all...

00:32:54.110 --> 00:32:56.240
It was all the order of Governor Jiang.

00:32:56.480 --> 00:32:57.340
Preposterous!

00:32:57.720 --> 00:32:59.750
Do you know that falsely accusing
a government official

00:32:59.750 --> 00:33:01.480
is punishable by death by dismemberment?

00:33:01.480 --> 00:33:02.240
Heaven knows

00:33:02.680 --> 00:33:03.680
I dare not lie.

00:33:04.310 --> 00:33:05.640
Ten years ago, you arbitrarily ruled that

00:33:05.640 --> 00:33:06.790
Wei Kejian was a murderer.

00:33:06.790 --> 00:33:08.830
To quickly close the case
and quiet public opinion,

00:33:08.830 --> 00:33:09.680
you instructed Xu Song

00:33:09.680 --> 00:33:11.090
to substitute a male corpse for Madam Yang

00:33:11.090 --> 00:33:12.440
and hastily closed the case.

00:33:12.440 --> 00:33:13.680
You feared that Lu Jianglai
and Rong Shanbao

00:33:13.680 --> 00:33:14.810
would continue investigating.

00:33:14.810 --> 00:33:16.120
You also feared
those county officials in prison

00:33:16.120 --> 00:33:17.510
might overturn the verdict
and take it up the chain.

00:33:17.510 --> 00:33:19.200
Sooner or later,
it would come back to you.

00:33:19.200 --> 00:33:21.600
So you decided
to eliminate all loose ends.

00:33:22.030 --> 00:33:24.070
You keep saying I instructed you.

00:33:24.590 --> 00:33:26.050
What evidence do you have?

00:33:26.270 --> 00:33:27.790
For our regular communications,

00:33:27.790 --> 00:33:29.260
you always sent him to find me.

00:33:29.260 --> 00:33:29.920
I remember

00:33:29.920 --> 00:33:31.070
every time and place clearly.

00:33:31.070 --> 00:33:32.270
Imperial Inspector.

00:33:33.000 --> 00:33:34.590
My Lord, I have no idea

00:33:34.590 --> 00:33:36.320
what this man is talking about.

00:33:38.350 --> 00:33:40.610
Lord Luo, you heard it with your own ears.

00:33:41.050 --> 00:33:42.660
Now you understand

00:33:42.690 --> 00:33:44.690
how difficult this case is to judge.

00:33:44.720 --> 00:33:45.960
I came to Linji

00:33:46.350 --> 00:33:48.590
originally to deliver
birthday gifts to the Empress Dowager,

00:33:48.590 --> 00:33:50.920
never expecting to encounter such a case.

00:33:51.400 --> 00:33:53.000
This tea farmer, Chen Asong,

00:33:53.070 --> 00:33:56.400
has accused Rong Shanbao
of using tea cultivation as a cover

00:33:56.750 --> 00:33:59.950
to secretly forge weapons
and store thousands of armors.

00:34:00.070 --> 00:34:00.920
To be safe,

00:34:01.270 --> 00:34:03.110
I have consulted with
the Provincial Governor

00:34:03.110 --> 00:34:05.600
to immediately deploy troops
and search the mountains.

00:34:05.600 --> 00:34:06.930
My Lord, this matter...

00:34:10.960 --> 00:34:12.710
Take Rong Shanbao along.

00:34:16.400 --> 00:34:18.320
Lord Lu, please.

00:34:24.280 --> 00:34:26.070
Lord Lu, what should I do?

00:34:26.760 --> 00:34:28.280
My Lord! My Lord!

00:34:42.590 --> 00:34:44.190
Lady Shanbao isn't at the tea plantation.

00:34:44.190 --> 00:34:45.800
The officials have arrested many people.

00:34:45.800 --> 00:34:47.400
Everyone is scattered and in chaos.

00:34:47.400 --> 00:34:49.040
Thankfully, you two ladies came to help.

00:34:49.040 --> 00:34:50.179
Otherwise, when Lady Shanbao returns,

00:34:50.179 --> 00:34:52.150
I wouldn't know
how to explain this situation.

00:34:52.150 --> 00:34:53.610
We are sisters, after all.

00:34:53.710 --> 00:34:55.000
No need to be so formal.

00:34:55.760 --> 00:34:56.889
If I were in trouble,

00:34:57.110 --> 00:34:57.880
your lady

00:34:57.880 --> 00:34:59.610
wouldn't stand by idly either.

00:35:01.320 --> 00:35:03.320
Such a major incident has happened,

00:35:03.530 --> 00:35:05.360
yet Grandmother is being biased,

00:35:05.360 --> 00:35:06.800
ignoring Shanbao completely.

00:35:06.800 --> 00:35:07.280
Who knows

00:35:07.280 --> 00:35:08.590
what the Rong family

00:35:09.180 --> 00:35:10.640
will become in the future?

00:35:11.070 --> 00:35:12.270
Lady Shanbao is back!

00:35:27.670 --> 00:35:28.440
Shanbao!

00:35:39.230 --> 00:35:41.690
Shanbao, why have
the officials come again?

00:35:42.070 --> 00:35:42.710
Lord Luo,

00:35:43.360 --> 00:35:44.430
the troops inside
and outside the tea plantation

00:35:44.430 --> 00:35:45.920
have already completed their search.

00:35:45.920 --> 00:35:46.960
I fear this time

00:35:47.190 --> 00:35:48.960
someone is afraid of being investigated

00:35:48.960 --> 00:35:50.760
and deliberately wasting time.

00:35:50.800 --> 00:35:51.590
Lu Jianglai,

00:35:52.320 --> 00:35:54.840
don't think that because
you're favored by His Majesty

00:35:54.840 --> 00:35:56.770
you can disrespect your superior.

00:35:57.510 --> 00:35:59.800
As the saying goes,
a cunning rabbit has three burrows.

00:35:59.800 --> 00:36:01.320
If the Rong family has tunnels,

00:36:01.320 --> 00:36:03.360
wouldn't they have them
in the mountains too?

00:36:03.360 --> 00:36:05.290
It's better to search thoroughly.

00:36:05.880 --> 00:36:07.280
Bring the person up here.

00:36:18.630 --> 00:36:19.690
Lady Rong Shanbao,

00:36:19.920 --> 00:36:21.120
do you recognize him?

00:36:22.880 --> 00:36:23.440
Traitor!

00:36:23.720 --> 00:36:24.310
What nonsense

00:36:24.310 --> 00:36:25.470
have you been telling the officials?

00:36:25.470 --> 00:36:26.800
Lady Shanbao has been kind to you
because of your young age,

00:36:26.800 --> 00:36:28.110
taking special care of you,

00:36:28.110 --> 00:36:29.510
yet you dare to falsely accuse her?

00:36:29.510 --> 00:36:32.440
Aren't you afraid heaven's lightning
will strike you dead?

00:36:32.440 --> 00:36:34.110
Speak! Where are the weapons?

00:36:39.320 --> 00:36:41.520
They're hidden in that cave over there.

00:36:42.190 --> 00:36:43.400
Weapons?

00:36:44.060 --> 00:36:46.720
How could there
be weapons on the tea mountains?

00:36:50.440 --> 00:36:50.960
Search!

00:37:08.000 --> 00:37:09.200
Take everything out!

00:37:09.360 --> 00:37:10.000
Yes!

00:37:20.710 --> 00:37:21.400
Open it.

00:37:21.550 --> 00:37:22.030
Yes.

00:37:36.920 --> 00:37:37.670
This is aged green tea

00:37:37.670 --> 00:37:39.240
that has been stored for 5 years.

00:37:39.240 --> 00:37:40.770
Please be careful, My Lord.

00:37:40.920 --> 00:37:41.980
If it gets chipped,

00:37:42.320 --> 00:37:43.630
it won't sell for much.

00:37:44.440 --> 00:37:46.150
Open them! Open all of them!

00:38:03.710 --> 00:38:04.230
My Lord.

00:38:04.440 --> 00:38:05.170
Zhang Zhong,

00:38:05.480 --> 00:38:07.140
what exactly is going on here?

00:38:07.920 --> 00:38:09.960
Where are the weapons you mentioned?

00:38:09.960 --> 00:38:11.480
My Lord, this isn't right!

00:38:11.770 --> 00:38:12.960
There must be weapons here!

00:38:12.960 --> 00:38:13.800
This isn't right!

00:38:13.800 --> 00:38:15.460
Quickly! Search everywhere!

00:38:15.510 --> 00:38:16.070
My Lord.

00:38:19.190 --> 00:38:20.250
Lady Rong Shanbao.

00:38:21.550 --> 00:38:22.110
Please.

00:38:32.630 --> 00:38:33.550
My Lord, spare me!

00:38:33.550 --> 00:38:35.000
The Provincial Governor said

00:38:35.000 --> 00:38:37.150
there must be weapons
hidden in the tea mountains

00:38:37.150 --> 00:38:38.710
and that Lady Shanbao
was planning a rebellion.

00:38:38.710 --> 00:38:39.970
If I couldn't confess,

00:38:40.030 --> 00:38:41.430
he would beat me to death.

00:38:41.860 --> 00:38:43.210
I've never heard anything

00:38:43.210 --> 00:38:44.790
about privately making weapons

00:38:44.790 --> 00:38:46.180
or raising troops.

00:38:46.690 --> 00:38:47.810
To save my life,

00:38:47.980 --> 00:38:48.760
I randomly pointed to

00:38:48.760 --> 00:38:50.520
a cellar used for making tea bricks.

00:38:50.520 --> 00:38:52.030
I just wanted to stay alive.

00:38:52.030 --> 00:38:53.330
Please don't kill me, My Lord.

00:38:53.330 --> 00:38:54.370
Don't kill me.

00:38:57.280 --> 00:38:58.400
I only asked you to interrogate,

00:38:58.400 --> 00:38:59.550
yet you used threats and bribes

00:38:59.550 --> 00:39:00.590
to fabricate evidence.

00:39:00.590 --> 00:39:01.650
You deserve to die!

00:39:08.710 --> 00:39:09.480
Lord Luo.

00:39:11.030 --> 00:39:12.890
Times have been hard these years.

00:39:13.220 --> 00:39:15.320
The border regions
have suffered either natural disasters

00:39:15.320 --> 00:39:16.720
or man-made calamities.

00:39:17.140 --> 00:39:18.580
Whenever war breaks out,

00:39:19.410 --> 00:39:20.550
the court urgently needs to transport

00:39:20.550 --> 00:39:22.320
large quantities of provisions.

00:39:22.320 --> 00:39:24.150
Others fear the dangers of war,

00:39:24.480 --> 00:39:25.650
the long journeys and low profits,

00:39:25.650 --> 00:39:27.050
avoiding it at all costs.

00:39:27.330 --> 00:39:30.110
Only the Rong family
has wholeheartedly organized

00:39:30.110 --> 00:39:32.640
and risked dangers
to transport provisions.

00:39:32.710 --> 00:39:34.110
In just these 20 years,

00:39:34.920 --> 00:39:36.220
the rice and grain
transported by our family

00:39:36.220 --> 00:39:37.880
has exceeded a million loads.

00:39:37.880 --> 00:39:39.920
The court still owes my family

00:39:39.920 --> 00:39:41.120
for transportation.

00:39:41.390 --> 00:39:44.100
Three years ago, the northern border
suffered a severe drought.

00:39:44.100 --> 00:39:46.210
The court wanted to show benevolence
to pacify the people,

00:39:46.210 --> 00:39:47.580
urging so urgently

00:39:47.760 --> 00:39:50.150
that cotton and grain
couldn't be gathered in time.

00:39:50.150 --> 00:39:51.450
Again it was the Rong family

00:39:51.450 --> 00:39:53.760
who managed to rush
supplies from the south.

00:39:53.760 --> 00:39:56.070
The Empress Dowager praised
our family's loyalty and courage,

00:39:56.070 --> 00:39:57.870
calling us pillars of the state.

00:40:02.400 --> 00:40:04.110
Lord Jiang instigated bandits

00:40:04.110 --> 00:40:05.510
to plunder the Rong family.

00:40:05.510 --> 00:40:07.280
When he failed to frame Lady Rong Shanbao,

00:40:07.280 --> 00:40:08.540
he fabricated charges

00:40:08.630 --> 00:40:10.630
and accused the Rong family of rebellion.

00:40:10.630 --> 00:40:12.190
He's acting out of personal grudges,

00:40:12.190 --> 00:40:13.320
framing the innocent.

00:40:13.320 --> 00:40:15.550
misleading official business
and harming good people,

00:40:15.550 --> 00:40:18.340
How dare he shamelessly remain
in a position of such power?

00:40:18.340 --> 00:40:20.740
Lord Luo, according to our dynasty's laws,

00:40:20.960 --> 00:40:22.450
those who falsely accuse
10 or more persons

00:40:22.450 --> 00:40:24.670
shall suffer death by dismemberment, with
their head displayed in their hometown.

00:40:24.670 --> 00:40:25.960
Lord Jiang has falsely accused

00:40:25.960 --> 00:40:27.320
the entire Rong family.

00:40:28.110 --> 00:40:30.510
Lord Luo, I hope you
will report to the court

00:40:30.760 --> 00:40:32.560
and request severe punishment.

00:40:34.440 --> 00:40:35.170
Ridiculous.

00:40:36.190 --> 00:40:38.850
I came to investigate
after receiving reports.

00:40:39.070 --> 00:40:40.150
How is it that when I arrive here

00:40:40.150 --> 00:40:41.950
it becomes my false accusation?

00:40:42.030 --> 00:40:44.560
The captured bandits
are heinous criminals.

00:40:44.600 --> 00:40:46.560
They're smearing my reputation.

00:40:46.730 --> 00:40:48.130
How can you believe them?

00:40:48.190 --> 00:40:49.550
The tea farmers on these tea mountains

00:40:49.550 --> 00:40:50.550
number 1,200.

00:40:51.110 --> 00:40:53.840
Everyone is fabricating accusations
against you, Lord Jiang.

00:40:53.840 --> 00:40:54.880
Lord Jiang, you truly

00:40:54.880 --> 00:40:56.680
have lost the people's support.

00:40:58.380 --> 00:40:59.760
The tea farmers on these mountains

00:40:59.760 --> 00:41:01.630
are all your Rong family's people,

00:41:01.630 --> 00:41:03.360
so of course they speak for you.

00:41:03.590 --> 00:41:06.410
Since taking office,
I have been upright and honest,

00:41:06.410 --> 00:41:08.380
never forming factions or cliques.

00:41:08.380 --> 00:41:09.240
The Rong family

00:41:09.360 --> 00:41:10.960
has absolute power in Linji.

00:41:11.070 --> 00:41:12.380
Now you've brought Lu Jianglai

00:41:12.380 --> 00:41:13.310
under your wing.

00:41:13.710 --> 00:41:15.190
You're afraid that I, as Governor,

00:41:15.190 --> 00:41:16.960
will block your money-making schemes.

00:41:16.960 --> 00:41:18.550
So you've joined forces

00:41:19.040 --> 00:41:20.270
to get rid of me.

00:41:24.920 --> 00:41:25.710
Take a look

00:41:26.190 --> 00:41:26.960
at this.

00:41:29.710 --> 00:41:30.970
An heirloom jade seal.

00:41:37.270 --> 00:41:39.360
Lord Jiang, to cover up his own mistakes,

00:41:39.360 --> 00:41:41.890
falsely accused my family
of making weapons.

00:41:41.900 --> 00:41:43.560
What are his true intentions?

00:41:44.030 --> 00:41:44.980
Or do you think

00:41:45.320 --> 00:41:47.180
by sacrificing a minor official,

00:41:47.190 --> 00:41:48.360
you can shift the blame

00:41:48.360 --> 00:41:49.820
and wash your hands clean?

00:41:51.110 --> 00:41:51.800
Lord Luo,

00:41:52.550 --> 00:41:54.150
are you just going to stand by

00:41:54.510 --> 00:41:56.440
while loyal subjects are wronged?

00:42:09.400 --> 00:42:10.150
Rise.

00:42:23.000 --> 00:42:25.070
I represent the Emperor
on this inspection.

00:42:25.070 --> 00:42:26.000
I never expected

00:42:27.280 --> 00:42:30.230
to encounter such
a serious case of false accusation.

00:42:30.230 --> 00:42:31.440
The truth is clear to all.

00:42:31.440 --> 00:42:33.170
I must thoroughly investigate

00:42:33.280 --> 00:42:35.140
and question those responsible.

00:42:35.230 --> 00:42:36.840
Please rest assured.

00:42:37.590 --> 00:42:39.590
I will never

00:42:39.920 --> 00:42:41.380
wrong an innocent family.

00:42:42.840 --> 00:42:44.700
Justice will not be compromised.

00:42:45.840 --> 00:42:47.100
Lord Luo, you're wise.

00:42:48.570 --> 00:42:51.430
I hope you'll examine
this case carefully, My Lord.

00:45:30.500 --> 00:45:32.790
[Tea Brick]

00:45:34.440 --> 00:45:35.230
This is aged green tea

00:45:35.230 --> 00:45:36.760
that has been stored for 5 years.

00:45:36.760 --> 00:45:38.290
Please be careful, My Lord.

00:45:38.510 --> 00:45:39.570
If it gets chipped,

00:45:39.920 --> 00:45:41.230
it won't sell for much.

00:45:42.080 --> 00:45:42.440
[Tea brick;
Dense structure; Improves with age]

00:45:42.440 --> 00:45:43.030
Why did ancient people

00:45:43.030 --> 00:45:44.830
make tea leaves into tea bricks?

00:45:45.280 --> 00:45:46.080
Just imagine.

00:45:46.670 --> 00:45:48.030
In ancient times,
there were no refrigerators

00:45:48.030 --> 00:45:49.150
or express delivery services.

00:45:49.150 --> 00:45:50.960
If tea leaves weren't properly stored,

00:45:50.960 --> 00:45:52.360
they would easily spoil.

00:45:52.440 --> 00:45:54.070
And tea leaves are very fluffy,

00:45:54.070 --> 00:45:56.280
taking up a lot of space during transport.

00:45:56.280 --> 00:45:57.280
So clever ancient people

00:45:57.280 --> 00:45:58.610
came up with a solution.

00:45:58.670 --> 00:46:00.000
They steamed the tea leaves until soft,

00:46:00.000 --> 00:46:01.150
then used molds

00:46:01.150 --> 00:46:02.610
to press them into blocks.

00:46:02.630 --> 00:46:03.980
Just like making cookies.

00:46:03.980 --> 00:46:05.320
This made them easier to preserve

00:46:05.320 --> 00:46:06.720
and convenient to carry.

00:46:06.800 --> 00:46:08.190
Tea bricks were first used
in the imperial court

00:46:08.190 --> 00:46:09.480
and by the nobility.

00:46:09.970 --> 00:46:12.100
Then they spread to frontier regions.

00:46:12.230 --> 00:46:13.150
They became treasures

00:46:13.150 --> 00:46:14.480
that nomads couldn't live without.

00:46:14.480 --> 00:46:16.760
They would carry tea bricks
while riding on horseback,

00:46:16.760 --> 00:46:17.960
brewing a cup whenever they wished—

00:46:17.960 --> 00:46:21.040
not only to quench their thirst,
but also to aid digestion.

00:46:21.040 --> 00:46:22.680
The production process of tea bricks

00:46:22.680 --> 00:46:24.600
preserves active ingredients

00:46:24.630 --> 00:46:26.590
while creating a compact structure.

00:46:26.590 --> 00:46:27.390
This achieved

00:46:27.480 --> 00:46:30.150
the legendary quality
of improving with age.
