WEBVTT

00:00:49.237 --> 00:00:50.363
Do La-ik?

00:00:52.657 --> 00:00:53.783
Do La-ik!

00:01:18.641 --> 00:01:19.642
Do La-ik…

00:01:23.521 --> 00:01:24.397
Tell me.

00:01:27.859 --> 00:01:29.193
Explain what all this is.

00:01:39.913 --> 00:01:41.122
Explain it.

00:01:43.249 --> 00:01:45.501
Why is this here?

00:01:50.882 --> 00:01:52.675
From the start, something felt off.

00:01:53.301 --> 00:01:55.511
Do lawyers normally go this far?

00:02:01.434 --> 00:02:03.228
Even if it's your job,

00:02:03.853 --> 00:02:07.357
believing me no matter what,
protecting me like that.

00:02:09.192 --> 00:02:10.777
It didn't make sense. But then--

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:13.696
-La-ik, that's not what--
-Then what is it?

00:02:23.331 --> 00:02:24.499
It's… (Support Admin Watch on
kissasia.cam or kisskh.org)

00:02:27.460 --> 00:02:30.171
true I was your fan.

00:02:32.173 --> 00:02:34.467
But that wasn't the reason
I took your case.

00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:36.219
Then why did you?

00:02:38.471 --> 00:02:40.181
And why did you hide this?

00:02:45.353 --> 00:02:47.730
If you'd just been honest
from the beginning,

00:02:48.481 --> 00:02:49.732
I could've handled it.

00:02:50.984 --> 00:02:53.695
I wouldn't have relied on you like this.

00:02:55.863 --> 00:02:57.949
This was the first time in my life

00:02:58.908 --> 00:03:01.577
someone defended me.

00:03:02.954 --> 00:03:04.998
Someone simply said they believed me.

00:03:07.083 --> 00:03:09.627
That they were on my side. I was grateful.

00:03:11.671 --> 00:03:13.673
Not because I'm Do La-ik from Gold Boys,

00:03:14.841 --> 00:03:17.468
but because I thought you saw just me.

00:03:19.012 --> 00:03:20.138
So…

00:03:20.805 --> 00:03:23.266
for the first time,
I trusted someone without a doubt.

00:03:23.349 --> 00:03:25.351
I believed everything I saw.

00:03:28.312 --> 00:03:29.856
But I guess I was wrong.

00:03:39.407 --> 00:03:40.908
If…

00:03:47.081 --> 00:03:49.667
I wasn't Do La-ik of Gold Boys,

00:03:52.545 --> 00:03:54.380
would you still have defended me?

00:03:55.882 --> 00:03:56.841
Would you still…

00:03:59.093 --> 00:04:00.887
have believed me?

00:04:39.801 --> 00:04:41.094
When did it start?

00:05:08.496 --> 00:05:13.084
What if you found out
that someone you really trusted…

00:05:14.877 --> 00:05:17.797
told you a huge lie?

00:05:18.631 --> 00:05:20.133
What do you think you would do?

00:05:23.886 --> 00:05:25.471
Since when…

00:05:34.564 --> 00:05:36.232
has she been lying to me?

00:05:43.948 --> 00:05:45.950
MANAGER HAN-GU

00:06:06.596 --> 00:06:09.015
Attorney Maeng, why are all the doors…

00:06:10.892 --> 00:06:14.604
What is all this? Why is this…

00:06:15.521 --> 00:06:16.856
La-ik knows everything.

00:06:17.690 --> 00:06:18.524
What?

00:06:24.697 --> 00:06:25.823
He saw all of this?

00:06:31.787 --> 00:06:34.248
I told you I should've thrown it out.

00:06:34.749 --> 00:06:37.418
-If I had, none of this would've happened.
-Don't touch it.

00:06:39.003 --> 00:06:40.463
I'll do it.

00:06:43.216 --> 00:06:44.342
I…

00:06:46.302 --> 00:06:47.637
I can do it.

00:06:47.720 --> 00:06:49.555
If you could,
you would've done it already.

00:06:50.431 --> 00:06:51.849
What did you tell me, huh?

00:06:51.933 --> 00:06:53.851
"No personal feelings."

00:06:53.935 --> 00:06:56.479
"I took the case as a lawyer, not a fan."

00:06:56.562 --> 00:06:58.105
And you can't even throw this out?

00:06:58.189 --> 00:07:00.066
I was going to throw it away!

00:07:16.040 --> 00:07:18.042
I tried to let go
of my feelings for La-ik.

00:07:18.125 --> 00:07:19.085
No, I already had.

00:07:19.168 --> 00:07:21.921
I had to, if I wanted to take his case.

00:07:23.172 --> 00:07:24.257
But…

00:07:27.718 --> 00:07:28.928
But…

00:07:32.014 --> 00:07:33.349
This…

00:07:35.768 --> 00:07:37.228
I just

00:07:39.063 --> 00:07:41.065
couldn't throw it away.

00:07:52.827 --> 00:07:54.537
If I did…

00:07:56.581 --> 00:08:00.209
then the time in my life
when I liked someone for the first time…

00:08:35.119 --> 00:08:36.871
DO LA-IK

00:08:36.954 --> 00:08:38.706
THE UNIVERSE THAT LED US
BACK TO EACH OTHER

00:08:38.789 --> 00:08:41.208
LA-IK'S FACE IS INSANELY GORGEOUS

00:08:53.596 --> 00:08:54.639
So cute!

00:08:57.391 --> 00:09:01.896
It felt like all those moments
would just vanish into nothing.

00:09:22.792 --> 00:09:23.626
Like

00:09:25.628 --> 00:09:28.589
the happy version of me back then
would disappear too.

00:09:33.636 --> 00:09:34.637
And that terrified me.

00:09:45.231 --> 00:09:46.440
So…

00:09:49.860 --> 00:09:52.113
I hid it away, deep down…

00:09:57.868 --> 00:10:00.246
and told myself
I'd never look at it again.

00:10:01.706 --> 00:10:03.791
I thought I'd be okay, but…

00:10:16.429 --> 00:10:17.763
You didn't hear from him either?

00:10:17.847 --> 00:10:19.598
With how things
are between Jae-hee and me,

00:10:19.682 --> 00:10:21.183
why would he call me?

00:10:21.767 --> 00:10:23.728
Even Young-bin doesn't know?

00:10:23.811 --> 00:10:24.895
He doesn't.

00:10:24.979 --> 00:10:27.982
Right before Young-bin was about to move
his stuff out of the dorm,

00:10:28.065 --> 00:10:30.401
he told Jae-hee he was quitting and left.

00:10:30.484 --> 00:10:31.318
Why Young-bin?

00:10:31.402 --> 00:10:33.863
He told me he was sorry for doubting you.

00:10:33.946 --> 00:10:36.407
Guess that made it awkward
for him to stay with Jae-hee.

00:10:41.954 --> 00:10:45.916
What do we do? The prosecution called.
They want him in for questioning.

00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:48.502
Jae-hee? Why?

00:10:48.586 --> 00:10:50.254
Wasn't he already questioned?

00:10:50.337 --> 00:10:51.964
I don't know.

00:10:52.631 --> 00:10:55.634
They said you'll be summoned soon, too.
Didn't your lawyer tell you?

00:11:05.644 --> 00:11:07.146
He's not saying anything.

00:11:07.229 --> 00:11:11.942
Where he's been,
why he suddenly fell out with his lawyer,

00:11:12.026 --> 00:11:13.194
he won't talk at all.

00:11:14.487 --> 00:11:16.280
I don't know if he doesn't trust me.

00:11:17.823 --> 00:11:20.534
For now, I told him to stay at the dorm.

00:11:21.410 --> 00:11:23.871
Young-bin's gone home anyway, so…

00:11:24.747 --> 00:11:25.623
Find him now.

00:11:26.207 --> 00:11:27.208
Sorry?

00:11:27.291 --> 00:11:28.334
Jae-hee.

00:11:28.417 --> 00:11:30.252
Find him however you can.

00:11:30.836 --> 00:11:33.631
We need to get to him
before the police do.

00:12:20.427 --> 00:12:21.262
Hello.

00:12:23.889 --> 00:12:24.765
What?

00:12:28.936 --> 00:12:31.230
-Attorney Maeng.
-How long has he been in there?

00:12:31.313 --> 00:12:34.858
It's been about two hours.
But the detective called yesterday.

00:12:35.818 --> 00:12:38.320
They were looking for Jae-hee.
Did something happen?

00:12:38.404 --> 00:12:39.405
They said you'd know.

00:12:40.447 --> 00:12:41.574
I'll explain it soon.

00:12:45.369 --> 00:12:46.579
How would I know

00:12:47.413 --> 00:12:48.747
where Jae-hee is?

00:12:48.831 --> 00:12:53.002
After he finished
his face-to-face questioning with you,

00:12:53.085 --> 00:12:54.461
he completely disappeared.

00:12:55.045 --> 00:12:58.591
He won't answer his phone,
and no one around him knows where he is.

00:12:59.091 --> 00:13:02.636
-Quite the coincidence, isn't it?
-What do you mean?

00:13:02.720 --> 00:13:05.681
He gave a statement that was
extremely damaging to you and vanished.

00:13:06.932 --> 00:13:09.101
Hard to call that

00:13:09.685 --> 00:13:11.437
a coincidence, don't you think?

00:13:13.522 --> 00:13:14.732
Are you

00:13:14.815 --> 00:13:17.443
seriously asking if,

00:13:17.526 --> 00:13:21.363
because he accused me,
I did something to him?

00:13:21.447 --> 00:13:24.199
Where were you after
the face-to-face questioning?

00:13:26.910 --> 00:13:28.245
Why can't you answer?

00:13:29.913 --> 00:13:32.207
-Where were you?
-Hold on!

00:13:37.713 --> 00:13:39.089
What do you think you're doing?

00:13:39.173 --> 00:13:40.549
Doing what, exactly?

00:13:40.633 --> 00:13:43.594
If you question a suspect
without their lawyer present, coercively,

00:13:43.677 --> 00:13:46.680
anything you obtain in that process
will be considered illegally--

00:13:46.764 --> 00:13:48.140
Your client

00:13:48.724 --> 00:13:51.185
agreed to be questioned without counsel.

00:13:51.769 --> 00:13:53.312
He consented to it.

00:13:54.229 --> 00:13:55.481
Isn't that right?

00:13:59.943 --> 00:14:02.279
If you stop the questioning now,

00:14:03.238 --> 00:14:04.657
you'll be overriding

00:14:04.740 --> 00:14:07.618
your client's own voluntary choice.

00:14:08.577 --> 00:14:10.204
Depending on the situation,

00:14:10.287 --> 00:14:13.874
a suspect can waive
the right to counsel, right?

00:14:38.023 --> 00:14:39.441
Wait.

00:14:39.525 --> 00:14:41.235
Please talk to me.

00:14:42.403 --> 00:14:43.612
La-ik.

00:14:56.583 --> 00:14:58.460
I know you're disappointed in me.

00:14:59.294 --> 00:15:01.797
But if you keep getting questioned
without your lawyer,

00:15:01.880 --> 00:15:04.174
-you won't be protected--
-Stop.

00:15:05.217 --> 00:15:07.636
Whatever comes out
of your mouth right now,

00:15:09.304 --> 00:15:10.556
I can't believe any of it.

00:15:16.020 --> 00:15:17.813
You're right. I was your fan.

00:15:26.822 --> 00:15:30.075
It's true, that's why I took an interest
in the case at first.

00:15:30.159 --> 00:15:32.828
But the moment
I decided to be your lawyer,

00:15:32.911 --> 00:15:34.788
I put all of that away.

00:15:35.539 --> 00:15:36.582
I took this case

00:15:37.499 --> 00:15:39.877
because something felt off,
the investigation had holes,

00:15:39.960 --> 00:15:43.005
your statement was credible.

00:15:43.088 --> 00:15:44.840
Work is work,
and personal is personal.

00:15:45.340 --> 00:15:47.384
The one I liked was La-ik of Gold Boys.

00:15:47.468 --> 00:15:48.761
But the one I'm defending…

00:15:51.680 --> 00:15:52.806
is Do La-ik, the person.

00:15:54.099 --> 00:15:55.601
For me,

00:15:55.684 --> 00:15:57.853
those two are different people.

00:15:58.896 --> 00:15:59.938
Is that still not enough?

00:16:00.856 --> 00:16:02.316
That's exactly why it's not enough.

00:16:05.694 --> 00:16:07.237
I want to be able to do that too.

00:16:07.821 --> 00:16:10.199
Work is work, and personal is personal.

00:16:11.408 --> 00:16:14.203
It would be nice if I could draw
a line that clearly.

00:16:14.286 --> 00:16:15.746
But the problem is…

00:16:21.335 --> 00:16:22.586
I'm not acting like this

00:16:23.879 --> 00:16:26.799
because I think you lied to me.

00:16:29.635 --> 00:16:31.178
It's because you made me believe you.

00:16:34.181 --> 00:16:35.516
You're fired.

00:16:57.162 --> 00:16:59.915
La-ik. What did they say?

00:17:01.500 --> 00:17:02.376
Where's your lawyer?

00:17:05.045 --> 00:17:06.171
Did you call her here?

00:17:07.005 --> 00:17:08.757
Don't contact her again.

00:17:08.841 --> 00:17:11.343
She has nothing to do with me anymore.

00:17:34.241 --> 00:17:35.993
I'm not acting like this

00:17:36.076 --> 00:17:40.122
because I think you lied to me.

00:17:42.791 --> 00:17:44.877
It's because you made me believe you.

00:18:02.227 --> 00:18:04.521
People are too mean.

00:18:12.571 --> 00:18:15.240
If someone doesn't get
on the elevator, they should at least ask,

00:18:15.324 --> 00:18:17.492
"Not getting on?"

00:18:17.576 --> 00:18:19.828
Everyone only thinks about themselves.

00:18:21.288 --> 00:18:22.956
Your client, too.

00:18:23.040 --> 00:18:26.668
After all you've done for him,
he decides to fire you now?

00:18:27.461 --> 00:18:29.588
I guess he thought
the attorney's fee was a waste?

00:18:29.671 --> 00:18:31.632
Not busy enough?
Want me to make you busier?

00:18:31.715 --> 00:18:34.051
No, I'm plenty busy already.

00:18:35.552 --> 00:18:36.970
Choi Jae-hee has gone missing.

00:18:38.388 --> 00:18:41.391
Pretty wild timing, isn't it?

00:18:41.975 --> 00:18:44.311
We don't know
if he's missing or just ran off.

00:18:44.394 --> 00:18:46.605
But you talk like the case
is already closed.

00:18:47.522 --> 00:18:49.274
If you really think his disappearance

00:18:49.358 --> 00:18:52.444
is connected to La-ik,
why don't you open a proper investigation?

00:18:53.028 --> 00:18:55.197
Right. You can't.

00:18:55.280 --> 00:18:57.908
If you poke the wrong place
and the suspect changes,

00:18:57.991 --> 00:19:01.370
you'd have to admit
your entire investigation was a mistake.

00:19:02.454 --> 00:19:05.707
Always quick on the uptake, aren't you?

00:19:06.708 --> 00:19:08.001
But you know how it works.

00:19:09.294 --> 00:19:11.129
Whatever pieces show up,

00:19:11.713 --> 00:19:13.590
I'm the one who decides

00:19:14.299 --> 00:19:15.717
how to weave them together.

00:19:16.802 --> 00:19:20.555
You're just like him. Your father.

00:19:21.932 --> 00:19:23.517
-What?
-The prosecution's job

00:19:23.600 --> 00:19:25.727
is to prove charges,
not decide the verdict

00:19:25.811 --> 00:19:27.688
and then force the evidence to match.

00:19:27.771 --> 00:19:29.398
But

00:19:29.481 --> 00:19:32.651
that's exactly what you're doing.

00:19:32.734 --> 00:19:33.735
Just like your father.

00:19:33.819 --> 00:19:36.113
Whatever the truth is,

00:19:36.196 --> 00:19:39.157
what matters is what gets proven in court.

00:19:39.241 --> 00:19:42.369
You should know that
after what your father went through.

00:19:42.452 --> 00:19:45.539
Once the verdict is out, that's it.

00:19:46.999 --> 00:19:49.001
Your father was guilty in the end,

00:19:49.584 --> 00:19:51.253
and Do La-ik will be no different.

00:19:52.462 --> 00:19:54.131
No matter how hard you fight,

00:19:54.798 --> 00:19:58.844
back then or now, you'll never beat me.

00:20:02.639 --> 00:20:04.766
Not getting on? Go ahead.

00:20:09.271 --> 00:20:10.772
Head down.

00:20:11.690 --> 00:20:14.026
And don't come crawling back up.

00:20:18.363 --> 00:20:19.781
Pathetic.

00:21:12.542 --> 00:21:16.088
It's me. I'd like to see you now.

00:21:22.344 --> 00:21:25.305
A former chief prosecutor
will be joining the case.

00:21:26.139 --> 00:21:28.517
We'll also bring in
a retired high-ranking official,

00:21:28.600 --> 00:21:32.396
and we're reaching out to someone
who's won a similar case.

00:21:32.479 --> 00:21:35.816
If there's anyone you prefer,
we can hire externally as well.

00:21:37.567 --> 00:21:38.777
I won't be joining.

00:21:40.612 --> 00:21:43.782
My retainer has already been terminated.
It was Mr. Do La-ik's decision.

00:21:43.865 --> 00:21:45.158
What?

00:21:45.242 --> 00:21:47.619
Things are moving too fast.

00:21:47.702 --> 00:21:50.789
Leaving him without counsel right now
is extremely dangerous.

00:21:51.373 --> 00:21:54.918
You need to make sure he signs
with a new attorney as soon as possible.

00:21:55.001 --> 00:21:56.711
Don't worry about that.

00:21:57.546 --> 00:21:58.880
But first…

00:21:58.964 --> 00:22:01.216
I want to know why.

00:22:01.800 --> 00:22:03.510
Why did he suddenly do that?

00:22:07.139 --> 00:22:09.641
I broke my client's trust.

00:22:11.101 --> 00:22:14.479
Please make that clear
to whoever takes over.

00:22:14.563 --> 00:22:17.274
I wasn't removed
because the case is unwinnable,

00:22:17.357 --> 00:22:19.234
but solely because of my own mistake.

00:22:19.901 --> 00:22:20.861
I will.

00:22:22.654 --> 00:22:24.865
Once you finalize the retainer,

00:22:24.948 --> 00:22:27.284
I'll compile everything
and send over the case files.

00:22:28.952 --> 00:22:30.036
Then…

00:22:31.037 --> 00:22:31.872
Attorney Maeng.

00:22:38.378 --> 00:22:41.923
Thank you
for handling La-ik's case so sincerely.

00:22:43.842 --> 00:22:45.635
From here on, I'll take care of it.

00:22:45.719 --> 00:22:47.554
I hope

00:22:48.138 --> 00:22:49.514
the two of you never meet again.

00:22:53.185 --> 00:22:54.394
Don't worry.

00:22:55.145 --> 00:22:56.229
That won't happen.

00:23:07.908 --> 00:23:09.367
Jae-hee?

00:23:11.870 --> 00:23:15.957
I saw him at the dorm
right before I headed home.

00:23:16.625 --> 00:23:18.793
I haven't talked to him since. Why?

00:23:19.544 --> 00:23:21.671
He didn't say he was going somewhere?

00:23:21.755 --> 00:23:24.090
No, nothing. Why?

00:23:24.966 --> 00:23:26.176
Did something happen?

00:23:27.010 --> 00:23:30.472
The manager seemed weird yesterday, too.
Is something going on with Jae-hee?

00:23:31.348 --> 00:23:35.352
No. If he contacts you,
call me right away.

00:23:45.070 --> 00:23:49.783
Mr. Choi Jae-hee is a crucial witness
who can prove your guilt.

00:23:49.866 --> 00:23:53.745
If he disappears right now,
the person who benefits the most,

00:23:55.413 --> 00:23:56.456
wouldn't that be you?

00:23:56.539 --> 00:23:58.875
-He definitely killed Woo-seong.
-No!

00:23:59.876 --> 00:24:02.128
I never killed him.

00:24:03.213 --> 00:24:05.674
-I believe…
-I believe…

00:24:05.757 --> 00:24:07.884
…in Do La-ik.

00:24:43.545 --> 00:24:48.008
Why are you so late?
Do you know what time it is?

00:24:48.091 --> 00:24:51.761
Hurry up, let's eat.
I'm seriously about to die from hunger.

00:25:29.299 --> 00:25:32.135
I'm hungry,
Attorney Maeng, let's eat.

00:25:44.856 --> 00:25:47.817
Don't look at stuff while you're eating.
Just eat.

00:25:50.070 --> 00:25:52.238
I am eating. Slowly.

00:25:52.322 --> 00:25:54.157
Here. Eat up.

00:25:54.240 --> 00:25:56.659
I should eat slowly.

00:25:56.743 --> 00:25:58.995
Hurry and eat before I finish everything.

00:27:15.113 --> 00:27:18.241
Jae-hee's completely cut contact.
He's gone off the grid.

00:27:18.324 --> 00:27:21.035
Why else would he do that?
He's hiding something!

00:27:21.119 --> 00:27:23.413
That still isn't proof he's the culprit.

00:27:23.496 --> 00:27:25.457
Look, he could've run.

00:27:25.540 --> 00:27:30.003
He lied about his alibi,
and no one can confirm he was at the dorm.

00:27:30.086 --> 00:27:32.005
We should issue a warrant and find him…

00:27:33.131 --> 00:27:35.300
From the beginning,
we've been investigating Do La-ik

00:27:35.383 --> 00:27:36.843
as the sole suspect.

00:27:38.970 --> 00:27:42.307
If we announce a new suspect now,
do you think the media will stay quiet?

00:27:43.433 --> 00:27:47.479
They'll say we targeted the wrong person,
that it was a biased investigation.

00:27:47.562 --> 00:27:51.774
And then neither of us
will be able to avoid responsibility.

00:27:53.443 --> 00:27:56.654
The best option is to handle this quietly
on our end.

00:27:57.238 --> 00:27:59.282
Quietly? That's impossible.

00:27:59.365 --> 00:28:02.785
The reporters are circling like sharks.
How are we supposed to stop them?

00:28:02.869 --> 00:28:05.747
It would be better if we moved first.

00:28:06.581 --> 00:28:08.708
We need a warrant now

00:28:08.791 --> 00:28:12.545
and need to start searches for everything.
His phone, his bank records, his car.

00:28:12.629 --> 00:28:16.090
If he slips abroad,
what are you going to do, huh?

00:28:19.677 --> 00:28:21.804
Every time you flip the suspect,

00:28:21.888 --> 00:28:25.225
it's not just you,
the entire prosecution loses credibility.

00:28:26.142 --> 00:28:30.480
Once you set a target,
you never change it.

00:28:30.563 --> 00:28:31.731
You never let it slip.

00:28:32.732 --> 00:28:35.109
There will be no change
in our investigation.

00:28:35.193 --> 00:28:37.403
You can issue a warrant. That's fine.

00:28:38.154 --> 00:28:40.323
But our primary suspect is still Do La-ik.

00:28:41.407 --> 00:28:45.078
Tracking down Choi Jae-hee will be framed
as part of strengthening the case

00:28:45.161 --> 00:28:48.373
against Do La-ik, officially.

00:28:49.541 --> 00:28:50.750
Hello?

00:28:52.085 --> 00:28:55.088
Hello? Are you listening?

00:28:56.798 --> 00:28:58.925
You knew all along, didn't you?

00:28:59.425 --> 00:29:01.344
About the tampering.
That it was Woo-seong.

00:29:04.013 --> 00:29:05.723
Don't even think about lying.

00:29:06.558 --> 00:29:08.852
I figured it out
from the way the manager was acting.

00:29:09.352 --> 00:29:11.896
Do La-ik said he would never do it.

00:29:11.980 --> 00:29:14.899
Young-bin doesn't have it in him,
and I know it wasn't me.

00:29:15.483 --> 00:29:17.318
So who's left? It's only Woo-seong.

00:29:18.194 --> 00:29:19.654
Am I wrong?

00:29:20.864 --> 00:29:23.783
Then why did you tell me
not to say anything to the police?

00:29:25.201 --> 00:29:26.744
Where are you right now?

00:29:45.972 --> 00:29:48.349
AGREEMENT FOR TERMINATION
OF THE MANDATE CONTRACT

00:29:48.433 --> 00:29:51.144
THE PARTIES AGREE TO TERMINATE
THE LEGAL REPRESENTATION AGREEMENT.

00:29:51.227 --> 00:29:54.522
PRINCIPAL: DO LA-IK
ATTORNEY IN CHARGE: MAENG SE-NA

00:30:21.049 --> 00:30:22.508
CALL

00:30:27.972 --> 00:30:29.933
ATTORNEY MAENG SE-NA

00:30:35.730 --> 00:30:38.232
-SE-NA, WHERE ARE YOU?
-I'M HOME

00:31:16.938 --> 00:31:18.439
ATTORNEY LEE JEONG-HA

00:31:23.277 --> 00:31:27.115
Attorney Maeng Se-na gave you my number?

00:31:27.699 --> 00:31:28.658
Yes.

00:31:29.701 --> 00:31:32.996
She contacted us herself
when she stepped down.

00:31:34.831 --> 00:31:40.503
I think she was worried about you
since you're still without counsel.

00:31:42.255 --> 00:31:45.133
We're very interested in your case.

00:31:45.717 --> 00:31:48.344
If you need any legal advice,

00:31:48.928 --> 00:31:50.513
please don't hesitate to reach out.

00:31:51.639 --> 00:31:52.724
I'll do my best.

00:31:54.892 --> 00:31:56.060
Sorry.

00:31:56.769 --> 00:31:58.396
I don't need a lawyer.

00:32:28.801 --> 00:32:30.636
I heard you turned him down?

00:32:32.055 --> 00:32:34.098
I went through a lot to bring him in.

00:32:35.850 --> 00:32:38.519
-You're really going without--
-It was you.

00:32:39.854 --> 00:32:41.230
I knew it.

00:32:41.314 --> 00:32:44.442
It was strange
that he contacted me out of nowhere.

00:32:44.525 --> 00:32:45.902
I'm sorry I didn't tell you.

00:32:47.403 --> 00:32:49.864
I thought
if I said I'd get you help, you'd hate it.

00:32:49.947 --> 00:32:51.783
If you knew I'd hate it,
why did you do that?

00:32:51.866 --> 00:32:54.410
Attorney Maeng Se-na came to see me.

00:32:55.870 --> 00:32:57.580
She asked me to find you a lawyer.

00:33:01.250 --> 00:33:04.712
Can't you just think of it
as a friend trying to help?

00:33:06.089 --> 00:33:09.175
As a friend,
isn't this the least I can do?

00:33:10.843 --> 00:33:11.928
You can't.

00:33:12.970 --> 00:33:15.181
If I accept someone's feelings,
I have to return them.

00:33:18.559 --> 00:33:20.103
And I…

00:33:21.354 --> 00:33:23.856
don't have anything left in me
to give back anymore.

00:33:25.066 --> 00:33:28.402
So don't do this anymore.

00:33:29.987 --> 00:33:31.030
Please.

00:33:31.989 --> 00:33:33.449
Is it because of her?

00:33:36.160 --> 00:33:37.370
Do you…

00:33:40.373 --> 00:33:41.541
like her?

00:34:33.176 --> 00:34:36.304
You don't look well at all.
Let's just rest today, okay?

00:34:38.264 --> 00:34:39.515
I'm fine.

00:34:39.599 --> 00:34:41.726
Fine? You don't look fine at all.

00:34:42.643 --> 00:34:45.688
You haven't been eating,
you haven't been sleeping.

00:34:47.023 --> 00:34:48.941
How long are you going to keep this up?

00:34:52.153 --> 00:34:53.863
I can't stand this,
because it's so frustrating.

00:34:54.405 --> 00:34:58.367
You're not feeling well. So just rest.
Stop pretending you're okay.

00:35:01.120 --> 00:35:02.955
If I don't keep moving,

00:35:04.040 --> 00:35:05.750
I feel like I'll fall apart.

00:35:07.210 --> 00:35:10.004
If I stay still, I start thinking.

00:35:11.464 --> 00:35:15.009
And if I think, I start regretting.

00:35:16.510 --> 00:35:17.553
And if I regret…

00:35:20.556 --> 00:35:22.141
I can't bear it.

00:35:28.147 --> 00:35:31.484
And… you can't see me?

00:35:55.299 --> 00:35:57.551
Don't you see

00:35:58.970 --> 00:36:00.263
how worried I am about you?

00:36:02.556 --> 00:36:05.184
Can't you lean on me
at least when it's this hard?

00:36:07.103 --> 00:36:09.522
I know you think of me like family.

00:36:11.023 --> 00:36:12.191
But…

00:36:27.957 --> 00:36:29.083
Chung-jae.

00:36:31.502 --> 00:36:33.296
I understand what you mean.

00:36:34.213 --> 00:36:35.172
But we…

00:36:37.174 --> 00:36:38.634
can't cross that line.

00:38:06.222 --> 00:38:08.015
THE LATE MAENG JI-YONG,
THE LATE PARK SU-HEE

00:38:37.211 --> 00:38:38.712
So it was you.

00:38:40.381 --> 00:38:43.008
You don't remember me?
I've seen you before.

00:38:43.092 --> 00:38:44.927
What's your registered address?

00:38:45.594 --> 00:38:47.930
I don't have one. I drift around.

00:38:49.807 --> 00:38:53.727
I don't have anywhere to go.
I just live wherever my feet take me.

00:39:06.282 --> 00:39:07.741
We split the water bill 50:50.

00:39:07.825 --> 00:39:10.119
Gas comes on a separate notice.

00:39:10.202 --> 00:39:12.455
Rent is due at the end of every month.

00:39:12.538 --> 00:39:13.789
That's all.

00:39:13.873 --> 00:39:14.957
Hey…

00:39:16.250 --> 00:39:17.751
Why are you helping me?

00:39:18.836 --> 00:39:20.671
I'm not helping you.

00:39:21.964 --> 00:39:24.258
I just didn't want
the spare room going to waste.

00:39:24.925 --> 00:39:28.387
And if you're ever late with the rent,
I'll take it in labor, just so you know.

00:40:15.434 --> 00:40:18.812
Attorney Maeng, I brought the documents
for the embezzlement case.

00:40:18.896 --> 00:40:20.814
Just leave them there.

00:40:23.692 --> 00:40:24.944
So…

00:40:25.736 --> 00:40:26.695
Are you okay?

00:40:28.280 --> 00:40:30.866
I mean, I thought you weren't going home.

00:40:32.117 --> 00:40:33.911
I still have some work left. Go ahead.

00:40:48.551 --> 00:40:50.052
She's working late again?

00:40:51.554 --> 00:40:53.138
She's been pushing herself like crazy.

00:40:53.222 --> 00:40:54.848
She has to.

00:40:54.932 --> 00:40:58.060
Everyone in Seocho heard
she got dropped from the case.

00:40:58.143 --> 00:41:00.813
Come on, it was just one case.
Does she have to go this far?

00:41:00.896 --> 00:41:03.482
It was a huge case.

00:41:03.566 --> 00:41:06.193
She needs to grab another big one
and rebuild her name.

00:41:06.277 --> 00:41:07.528
I don't think that's it.

00:41:08.487 --> 00:41:11.240
She's been really strange lately.

00:41:12.032 --> 00:41:15.536
She hardly talks, just works nonstop.

00:41:17.246 --> 00:41:19.164
It's like she has no emotions left.

00:41:19.790 --> 00:41:21.333
Like she's hollow inside.

00:41:22.418 --> 00:41:24.461
Let's just keep quiet. Take care.

00:41:26.088 --> 00:41:27.673
Bye.

00:41:47.526 --> 00:41:48.736
Are you busy?

00:41:49.653 --> 00:41:52.448
I'm just finishing this up before I leave.
What brings you here?

00:41:52.531 --> 00:41:54.074
Nothing…

00:41:58.287 --> 00:41:59.622
Then, do you have a minute?

00:42:08.922 --> 00:42:10.799
This is good.

00:42:11.675 --> 00:42:14.553
I was surprised to hear
you quit the case all of a sudden.

00:42:16.805 --> 00:42:19.683
I didn't quit, I was fired.

00:42:21.769 --> 00:42:24.021
Fired? Why?

00:42:25.898 --> 00:42:26.940
I told my client…

00:42:28.817 --> 00:42:32.321
a lie I shouldn't have.

00:42:32.905 --> 00:42:34.031
You?

00:42:38.577 --> 00:42:40.245
How did things get so tangled like this?

00:42:43.248 --> 00:42:45.000
Actually,

00:42:45.751 --> 00:42:47.670
there's something that bothered me.

00:42:47.753 --> 00:42:49.505
So I've been looking into that.

00:42:49.588 --> 00:42:50.798
Something bothered you?

00:42:50.881 --> 00:42:54.385
You remember we ran into each other
at Goldie Entertainment?

00:42:54.468 --> 00:42:55.678
Yes.

00:42:56.178 --> 00:42:57.346
Attorney Hwang

00:42:57.429 --> 00:43:00.683
had been digging around, trying to verify

00:43:00.766 --> 00:43:03.185
what Choi Jae-hee said
about the tampering issue.

00:43:03.268 --> 00:43:05.771
And it turns out
a little before the murder case happened,

00:43:06.897 --> 00:43:08.315
Gold Boys' contract

00:43:08.399 --> 00:43:12.486
was being quietly re-examined
by their legal team.

00:43:12.569 --> 00:43:15.614
What they focused on the most

00:43:15.698 --> 00:43:18.450
was the clause about breach of trust.

00:43:18.534 --> 00:43:22.079
As if someone in the group
was going to betray them and they knew it.

00:43:23.539 --> 00:43:24.498
Mr. Kang Woo-seong said

00:43:24.581 --> 00:43:28.085
he'd already worked things out with La-ik
and pushed hard for the contract.

00:43:29.253 --> 00:43:31.922
He was the one who handled
the entire negotiation.

00:43:34.258 --> 00:43:37.594
That Geum Bo-sang guy,
he's not someone you can trust.

00:43:38.303 --> 00:43:41.390
If he thinks anything threatens
his company, he'll go straight

00:43:41.473 --> 00:43:46.645
to lawsuits, smear campaigns,
push people to the edge until they break.

00:43:47.146 --> 00:43:49.356
It felt off to me,

00:43:49.440 --> 00:43:52.443
so we were planning to cut ties
with Goldie's legal team as well.

00:43:53.402 --> 00:43:56.405
I was going to tell you
once everything was sorted out,

00:43:56.488 --> 00:43:58.365
but you suddenly dropped
the case so quickly.

00:44:01.577 --> 00:44:05.748
Still, even if you're stepping away,

00:44:06.540 --> 00:44:09.251
don't you think
your client should know this?

00:44:10.294 --> 00:44:11.754
It might help him.

00:45:41.802 --> 00:45:44.680
Well, you said you couldn't drink.

00:45:45.472 --> 00:45:46.807
You're quite the heavy drinker.

00:46:10.831 --> 00:46:11.665
ATTORNEY MAENG SE-NA

00:46:20.215 --> 00:46:24.428
The caller cannot get to the phone…

00:46:28.765 --> 00:46:30.475
MR. DO LA-IK

00:46:31.059 --> 00:46:33.770
La-ik, I have something to tell…

00:47:17.022 --> 00:47:18.398
Where is she going?

00:49:27.402 --> 00:49:30.280
Cut the useless talk

00:49:30.363 --> 00:49:33.033
World-best Do La-ik!

00:49:33.116 --> 00:49:35.869
This is where it starts

00:49:49.257 --> 00:49:53.011
I'm not yours, so stop saying it

00:49:53.094 --> 00:49:55.597
Nothing you say can change…

00:49:58.558 --> 00:50:03.855
…so leave me alone, yeah!

00:50:06.483 --> 00:50:09.236
Like the stars shining brightly

00:50:10.445 --> 00:50:12.030
In the night sky

00:50:12.864 --> 00:50:16.535
I'll be free

00:50:32.467 --> 00:50:35.595
I'm not yours, so stop saying it

00:50:35.679 --> 00:50:40.433
I don't want to hear anything

00:50:56.700 --> 00:50:57.951
What am I doing?

00:51:20.974 --> 00:51:23.643
She threw everything out?

00:52:47.602 --> 00:52:49.187
CHOI JAE-HEE

00:52:50.438 --> 00:52:52.607
MISSED CALL

00:52:52.691 --> 00:52:54.651
YOU HAVE A NEW VOICE MESSAGE

00:52:58.071 --> 00:52:59.364
You're late.

00:53:02.033 --> 00:53:05.662
Work must be keeping you busy these days,
coming home this late.

00:53:10.125 --> 00:53:11.918
You've been giving me a lot of work.

00:53:15.130 --> 00:53:17.507
So what brings you all the way here?

00:53:17.590 --> 00:53:19.968
Because it's hard to see your face.

00:53:20.552 --> 00:53:21.803
You never show up at home.

00:53:23.471 --> 00:53:27.058
So you came here because you missed me?

00:53:29.185 --> 00:53:32.022
Hye-joo, do you know something?

00:53:32.105 --> 00:53:34.274
You only smile at me when you're lying.

00:53:37.861 --> 00:53:39.029
No need to look so shocked.

00:53:40.572 --> 00:53:42.240
You were questioned by the prosecution,

00:53:42.323 --> 00:53:45.744
hired an attorney because of Do La-ik.

00:53:45.827 --> 00:53:46.953
You think I wouldn't know?

00:53:49.706 --> 00:53:51.791
I've secured a position
at the California branch.

00:53:52.959 --> 00:53:56.004
I'll take care of everything here,
so go back to the States.

00:53:59.049 --> 00:54:00.091
Why?

00:54:00.925 --> 00:54:02.677
Sending your disgraceful daughter

00:54:03.261 --> 00:54:04.387
away again?

00:54:04.471 --> 00:54:05.972
I'm doing this for your sake.

00:54:06.056 --> 00:54:08.308
No. It's for the family's reputation.

00:54:10.185 --> 00:54:11.519
As always,

00:54:12.353 --> 00:54:15.023
you were always so busy hiding me,

00:54:15.106 --> 00:54:16.816
the mistress's child,

00:54:17.484 --> 00:54:19.402
worried I might embarrass the family.

00:54:19.486 --> 00:54:22.447
-Hye-joo--
-Why do you think I don't go to the house?

00:54:24.282 --> 00:54:27.410
Was there a single person
who welcomed me there?

00:54:28.828 --> 00:54:30.205
And the one person

00:54:31.456 --> 00:54:33.458
who did love me,

00:54:33.541 --> 00:54:35.752
what did you say you'd do to him?

00:54:37.087 --> 00:54:39.631
You threatened to ruin him.

00:54:39.714 --> 00:54:40.673
Hong Hye-joo.

00:54:40.757 --> 00:54:43.510
I did everything you asked!

00:54:51.476 --> 00:54:53.561
You told me to break up, I did.

00:54:54.896 --> 00:54:57.690
You told me to go to America, I did.

00:54:58.358 --> 00:55:01.569
So can't you just pretend
you don't see this one thing?

00:55:01.653 --> 00:55:02.946
He's a murder suspect.

00:55:03.696 --> 00:55:05.657
And you got dragged into an investigation.

00:55:05.740 --> 00:55:07.992
Do you know how hard I worked
to cover up those articles?

00:55:12.205 --> 00:55:13.248
See?

00:55:14.916 --> 00:55:17.127
Yet, you still care more
about what others think.

00:55:21.131 --> 00:55:23.007
You remember

00:55:23.883 --> 00:55:26.052
how broken I was in the States.

00:55:28.721 --> 00:55:30.473
If you go after La-ik,

00:55:31.349 --> 00:55:34.227
I'll be worse this time.

00:55:34.811 --> 00:55:35.854
Far worse.

00:55:35.937 --> 00:55:37.021
You!

00:55:38.231 --> 00:55:39.357
Dad.

00:55:40.775 --> 00:55:44.154
You love me.

00:55:47.866 --> 00:55:49.242
You can't lose

00:55:50.493 --> 00:55:52.579
someone you love again.

00:55:54.622 --> 00:55:55.665
Not like Mom.

00:55:58.710 --> 00:56:00.003
Right?

00:56:04.465 --> 00:56:05.508
Pull over for a sec.

00:56:06.926 --> 00:56:07.760
Here?

00:56:08.595 --> 00:56:09.470
Why?

00:56:10.346 --> 00:56:11.681
I need to use the restroom.

00:56:11.764 --> 00:56:14.851
Just stop the car, you talk too much.

00:56:15.476 --> 00:56:17.729
Where are you going to find
a restroom around here.

00:56:18.688 --> 00:56:20.523
There. Pull over there.

00:56:37.123 --> 00:56:38.583
When are we even getting home…

00:56:44.881 --> 00:56:46.174
What is that?

00:56:48.176 --> 00:56:49.135
Sir!

00:56:49.886 --> 00:56:51.221
Come here!

00:56:51.304 --> 00:56:52.430
What is it?

00:57:00.563 --> 00:57:04.067
What is that?
Did we get any accident reports today?

00:57:04.150 --> 00:57:05.652
No, none.

00:57:07.737 --> 00:57:09.906
Is that a person?

00:57:11.741 --> 00:57:12.825
-Damn it.
-Damn it.

00:57:45.400 --> 00:57:47.193
CHOI JAE-HEE

00:57:50.488 --> 00:57:53.199
Choi Jae-hee, where are you?

00:58:35.992 --> 00:58:37.368
Yes, Young-bin.

00:58:39.078 --> 00:58:40.330
What?

00:59:07.398 --> 00:59:09.108
MISSED CALL - CHOI JAE-HEE

00:59:13.571 --> 00:59:15.239
YOU HAVE A NEW VOICE MESSAGE

00:59:20.286 --> 00:59:21.537
DETECTIVE YU NAM-SIK

00:59:25.500 --> 00:59:26.459
Hello?

00:59:26.542 --> 00:59:27.752
This is Detective Yu.

00:59:29.879 --> 00:59:33.257
I need to confirm something.

00:59:34.509 --> 00:59:37.387
You got a call
from Choi Jae-hee last night, right?

00:59:38.012 --> 00:59:39.055
Why are you asking?

00:59:39.138 --> 00:59:42.225
Did you happen to speak with him?

00:59:45.103 --> 00:59:47.605
What is this about?

00:59:47.689 --> 00:59:49.023
It's that…

00:59:49.774 --> 00:59:51.818
Choi Jae-hee was just found.

00:59:52.652 --> 00:59:53.736
What?

00:59:53.820 --> 00:59:56.906
We found him.

00:59:59.200 --> 01:00:00.952
Breaking news just in.

01:00:01.035 --> 01:00:03.913
Choi Jae-hee,
a member of the idol group Gold Boys,

01:00:03.996 --> 01:00:08.626
who has been questioned as a witness
in the murder case of the late Woo-seong,

01:00:08.710 --> 01:00:14.173
was in a car accident last night

La-ik?

01:01:17.695 --> 01:01:18.738
La-ik!

01:02:59.922 --> 01:03:02.592
For staying by my side
when things were hard.

01:03:03.301 --> 01:03:05.761

01:03:06.804 --> 01:03:08.806
-Prosecutor!
-But there's still a chance left.

01:03:09.432 --> 01:03:13.144
Jae-hee left me a voice message that day.

01:03:13.769 --> 01:03:17.815
You think you know everything
about Woo-seong, don't you?

01:03:17.899 --> 01:03:21.819
There's something you need to know.
Something very important.

01:03:21.903 --> 01:03:25.740
I want to know the truth,
what really happened.

01:03:26.866 --> 01:03:30.828
