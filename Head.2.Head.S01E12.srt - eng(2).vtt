Viewer discretion is advised.

00:00:13.306 --> 00:00:14.716
Why act tough when you can’t handle it?

00:00:14.977 --> 00:00:16.629
I’m sorry I hurt you.

00:00:16.955 --> 00:00:19.040
I’ll work on myself…

00:00:19.322 --> 00:00:21.216
until I’m someone worthy of you.

00:00:21.216 --> 00:00:22.388
This is really what you want?

00:00:22.388 --> 00:00:24.201
Walk away all you want.

00:00:24.331 --> 00:00:26.051
My love will still follow you everywhere.

00:00:26.247 --> 00:00:27.583
Do you hear me, Farm?

00:00:27.727 --> 00:00:29.210
I’m done thinking it through.

00:00:29.297 --> 00:00:30.158
I’m sorry.

00:00:30.375 --> 00:00:32.399
Even if your feelings aren’t real,

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:35.260
mine have been real ever since I was seven.

00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:38.808
If I ever see a vision where we break up,

00:00:38.808 --> 00:00:40.362
I will get rid of it all.

00:00:47.228 --> 00:00:50.340
(I never thought one day
I’d write something so cliché,)

00:00:50.709 --> 00:00:52.363
(like the dramas I watched as a kid.)

00:00:52.950 --> 00:00:54.477
(But bear with me and keep reading,)

00:00:54.912 --> 00:00:57.022
(and don’t laugh at me just yet, asshole.)

00:00:57.891 --> 00:00:59.747
(I honestly don’t know
how to make this sound cool.)

00:01:00.551 --> 00:01:03.556
(The brain of a dying person
can’t be more creative.)

00:01:05.099 --> 00:01:08.960
(If you’re reading this letter,
that means I’m no longer in this world.)

00:01:09.742 --> 00:01:12.158
(Even though the time
we were together was short,)

00:01:12.549 --> 00:01:16.209
(whether it was real love
or just pity on your part,)

00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:20.402
(I thank you for making
the last moments of my life happy.)

00:01:21.032 --> 00:01:25.538
(After today, January 21,
I won’t be sharing your birthday anymore.)

00:01:26.125 --> 00:01:27.874
(You can have this birthday all to yourself.)

00:01:28.678 --> 00:01:30.629
(For your 31st birthday, I wish—)

00:01:31.389 --> 00:01:32.144
(No.)

00:01:32.839 --> 00:01:34.813
(This wish goes for the rest of your life.)

00:01:35.573 --> 00:01:38.500
(I wish every wish Jerome makes
from now on would come true.)

00:01:38.717 --> 00:01:39.640
(From Jinn.)

00:01:57.793 --> 00:01:59.400
I wish I could fix this.

00:02:04.810 --> 00:02:06.688
I wish we had more time to love each other.

00:02:08.339 --> 00:02:09.942
I wish everything…

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:12.407
didn’t end this way.

00:03:51.833 --> 00:03:52.517
Jan.

00:03:53.429 --> 00:03:54.446
What’s wrong?

00:03:54.902 --> 00:03:56.070
Our son didn’t disappear.

00:03:56.070 --> 00:03:57.954
He just spent the night
at the house across the road.

00:03:59.366 --> 00:04:00.981
Stop making that worried face, Jan.

00:04:02.719 --> 00:04:04.726
You know I’m not worried about that.

00:04:07.268 --> 00:04:10.004
I’ll do everything to make Jinn accept me.

00:04:10.504 --> 00:04:13.969
No matter how long it takes
or how hard it is,

00:04:14.490 --> 00:04:15.476
I’ll make it happen.

00:04:16.888 --> 00:04:22.950
I’m sorry I never told our son
that you’ve always been taking care of us.

00:04:23.689 --> 00:04:24.600
Jan.

00:04:24.926 --> 00:04:27.070
Everything happens for a reason.

00:04:27.678 --> 00:04:34.394
We made that choice because we wanted
Jinn to grow up as well as possible.

00:04:34.611 --> 00:04:36.295
Without having to deal with adult problems.

00:04:37.729 --> 00:04:40.481
And he grew up wonderfully. Right?

00:04:43.740 --> 00:04:44.680
So don’t stress yourself out.

00:04:52.677 --> 00:04:55.077
Giving in just this once
won’t make you lose face.

00:04:55.816 --> 00:04:56.714
You can do it.

00:05:04.145 --> 00:05:06.860
Come on. I’ll wait right here.

00:05:07.620 --> 00:05:08.957
If anything happens,
you can run straight to me.

00:05:09.739 --> 00:05:14.311
I promise I’ll be here,
with open arms, holding you tight.

00:05:29.515 --> 00:05:30.789
Will you come inside with me?

00:05:44.431 --> 00:05:45.521
I’ll leave for now.

00:05:47.455 --> 00:05:48.900
Hi, Auntie Jan, Uncle Jet.

00:05:51.029 --> 00:05:51.799
This woman…

00:05:53.602 --> 00:05:54.707
I’ve been taking the best care of her.

00:05:56.011 --> 00:05:58.293
If you’re in her life, help me take care of her.

00:05:58.923 --> 00:05:59.760
Don’t hurt her.

00:06:02.020 --> 00:06:02.520
Huh?

00:06:09.386 --> 00:06:10.153
Do you mean—

00:06:10.153 --> 00:06:11.117
Don’t you understand what I said?

00:06:14.333 --> 00:06:15.042
Jinn.

00:06:15.477 --> 00:06:17.727
Your dad’s been taking care of me
since before you were born.

00:06:17.727 --> 00:06:18.959
Mom!

00:06:18.959 --> 00:06:19.840
That’s all right.

00:06:19.967 --> 00:06:22.188
I don’t mind being second to you

00:06:24.509 --> 00:06:25.376
Good then.

00:06:26.202 --> 00:06:27.377
Don’t cut in line.

00:06:34.276 --> 00:06:35.687
Very egotistical, right?

00:06:37.143 --> 00:06:38.448
That’s good enough.

00:06:40.056 --> 00:06:42.075
Ever since you two started living together,

00:06:42.205 --> 00:06:44.009
what have you been feeding my son, J?

00:06:44.552 --> 00:06:46.225
He’s lost most of his stubbornness.

00:06:47.855 --> 00:06:49.183
Nothing.

00:06:49.400 --> 00:06:50.569
I didn’t do anything.

00:06:51.243 --> 00:06:52.367
Does this mean…

00:06:54.301 --> 00:06:58.137
the visions that you saw will change?

00:07:02.309 --> 00:07:03.217
Ah.

00:07:04.738 --> 00:07:06.206
I told Uncle Jet about it.

00:07:09.965 --> 00:07:12.024
I’m sorry, but I have to be honest here.

00:07:13.806 --> 00:07:15.374
I really don’t know.

00:07:18.720 --> 00:07:20.466
But if something really happens to me,

00:07:21.987 --> 00:07:25.161
at least Jinn has
his dad and you looking after him.

00:07:25.900 --> 00:07:27.118
I have no worries.

00:07:29.856 --> 00:07:32.346
Jan, don’t say things like that.

00:07:36.181 --> 00:07:38.698
Nothing is going to
happen to anyone, Auntie Jan.

00:07:52.058 --> 00:07:52.955
Van. Van.

00:07:53.498 --> 00:07:54.756
Do you have plans this evening?

00:07:55.560 --> 00:07:56.689
I don’t think so.

00:07:56.841 --> 00:07:57.931
What’s up, Grace?

00:07:58.170 --> 00:08:01.130
Mook’s throwing
a birthday party near campus.

00:08:01.565 --> 00:08:04.049
She wanted to invite you,
but she was too shy.

00:08:14.370 --> 00:08:15.560
Happy birthday, Mook.

00:08:15.560 --> 00:08:16.995
But I don’t think I can make it.

00:08:17.755 --> 00:08:19.210
I wish you all the happiness.

00:08:20.905 --> 00:08:23.739
Van, I saw that
you unfollowed me on Instagram.

00:08:23.739 --> 00:08:24.965
Are you mad at me or something?

00:08:25.899 --> 00:08:27.811
Ah, no. Why would I be mad?

00:08:28.115 --> 00:08:28.848
I just…

00:08:30.007 --> 00:08:30.959
I’m talking to someone right now,

00:08:31.527 --> 00:08:33.397
so I want to focus on them.

00:08:33.397 --> 00:08:34.607
Someone like you?

00:08:36.007 --> 00:08:37.101
Again, happy birthday.

00:08:37.775 --> 00:08:38.429
Let’s go.

00:08:44.187 --> 00:08:44.929
Hey.

00:08:47.037 --> 00:08:49.150
I know you don’t like my way of doing it.

00:08:49.802 --> 00:08:51.799
But someone like me has to quit cold turkey.

00:08:53.428 --> 00:08:56.074
It’s good that you want to
be a better version of yourself.

00:08:57.139 --> 00:08:58.755
But just don’t lose who you are.

00:09:01.097 --> 00:09:04.355
You know I like you for who you are, right?

00:09:07.006 --> 00:09:07.707
Wait a minute.

00:09:09.011 --> 00:09:12.150
Did you just say you like me?

00:09:14.757 --> 00:09:16.231
Slow down.

00:09:17.035 --> 00:09:18.634
My plan to win you back
has only just started.

00:09:19.003 --> 00:09:20.116
You’re already soft for me?

00:09:22.115 --> 00:09:22.856
Van.

00:09:24.551 --> 00:09:27.972
I know I’m so cute,

00:09:28.472 --> 00:09:30.480
and you wouldn’t stay cold forever,

00:09:31.740 --> 00:09:33.466
but I didn’t think it’d be this fast.

00:09:33.770 --> 00:09:35.286
You caught me off guard.

00:09:38.698 --> 00:09:39.519
Time for class.

00:09:40.040 --> 00:09:40.848
Give me a kiss first!

00:09:54.007 --> 00:09:55.523
Try to be casual about it.

00:09:56.371 --> 00:09:57.697
It’s just parents getting back together.

00:09:59.739 --> 00:10:01.403
Do you really think it’ll work out?

00:10:01.968 --> 00:10:04.552
What if he leaves my mom and me again?

00:10:05.052 --> 00:10:06.624
I was still young back then,

00:10:07.471 --> 00:10:09.806
but the image of my mom crying
is still clear in my mind.

00:10:11.609 --> 00:10:12.861
And if something like that happens again—

00:10:12.861 --> 00:10:14.290
But the truth Auntie Jan just told us…

00:10:15.029 --> 00:10:17.928
He never really left you or her, did he?

00:10:18.602 --> 00:10:21.423
Uncle Jet has always
been looking out for you from afar.

00:10:25.877 --> 00:10:27.040
That’s true.

00:10:28.300 --> 00:10:30.037
He chose to leave because

00:10:31.275 --> 00:10:33.969
he didn’t want you or Auntie Jan to get hurt.

00:10:34.165 --> 00:10:36.019
His fans were vicious.

00:10:36.258 --> 00:10:39.856
His family offered no acceptance.

00:10:40.269 --> 00:10:45.023
I think that choice made him suffer
just as much as everyone else.

00:10:45.436 --> 00:10:46.210
Mm.

00:10:47.470 --> 00:10:48.710
I…

00:10:49.579 --> 00:10:50.204
I believe you.

00:10:53.116 --> 00:10:54.526
Good boy.

00:10:57.959 --> 00:10:58.594
Hey.

00:10:58.920 --> 00:10:59.662
Hm?

00:11:00.835 --> 00:11:02.551
Now that everything’s changed,

00:11:03.051 --> 00:11:04.450
what about the vision

00:11:05.297 --> 00:11:08.476
you had about my mom?

00:11:09.432 --> 00:11:11.018
Will she be okay now?

00:11:12.322 --> 00:11:13.590
I honestly don’t know.

00:11:15.176 --> 00:11:17.402
But at least one thing has changed.

00:11:18.007 --> 00:11:20.958
Your family is whole again.

00:11:24.007 --> 00:11:26.706
From now on,
let’s take good care of each other.

00:11:27.227 --> 00:11:27.727
Okay?

00:11:36.510 --> 00:11:37.645
What are you two running away from?

00:11:38.492 --> 00:11:39.253
No.

00:11:39.514 --> 00:11:40.468
Nothing.

00:11:43.792 --> 00:11:45.196
Why are your cheeks flushed?

00:11:48.433 --> 00:11:49.093
Don’t think so.

00:11:49.614 --> 00:11:50.608
Maybe it’s hot outside.

00:12:10.291 --> 00:12:11.131
What’s the matter?

00:12:11.609 --> 00:12:13.512
Oh, it’s just my alarm.

00:12:13.664 --> 00:12:15.632
I have people come clean
my house three times a month.

00:12:16.436 --> 00:12:17.406
You hire housekeepers?

00:12:18.514 --> 00:12:20.940
Yeah. I need to go home to let them in.

00:12:22.222 --> 00:12:24.627
You can just cancel them.

00:12:24.627 --> 00:12:25.127
What?

00:12:26.148 --> 00:12:28.847
I’ll take you there
and we’ll clean your house together.

00:12:31.823 --> 00:12:32.520
Mm.

00:12:34.541 --> 00:12:35.228
Okay.

00:12:47.873 --> 00:12:48.847
Uh… I just…

00:12:48.847 --> 00:12:50.058
Do these go to Mom’s room?

00:12:52.687 --> 00:12:54.365
J, help me carry them.

00:13:21.940 --> 00:13:22.692
Why are you smiling?

00:13:36.745 --> 00:13:37.444
What are you doing?

00:13:38.357 --> 00:13:39.342
You did great.

00:13:40.559 --> 00:13:41.427
Did what great?

00:13:43.187 --> 00:13:44.249
About Uncle Jet.

00:13:45.531 --> 00:13:46.878
You keep getting better.

00:13:51.588 --> 00:13:52.381
Your reward.

00:13:57.118 --> 00:13:58.027
Also your reward.

00:13:58.223 --> 00:13:59.733
Pretty sure it’s not.

00:14:01.189 --> 00:14:02.544
That was your reward too.

00:14:03.717 --> 00:14:04.634
J…

00:14:06.177 --> 00:14:07.460
That’s not all.

00:14:17.241 --> 00:14:18.148
You should praise yourself.

00:14:19.517 --> 00:14:21.934
It was you who
gave me the courage to say it.

00:14:23.042 --> 00:14:25.193
So do I get a reward too?

00:14:30.104 --> 00:14:30.762
Yes.

00:14:45.273 --> 00:14:46.246
I want to go there.

00:14:46.246 --> 00:14:47.307
This looks familiar.

00:14:47.307 --> 00:14:48.710
It’s like the place my mom
took me to when I was young.

00:14:49.514 --> 00:14:50.671
I have an announcement.

00:14:50.910 --> 00:14:52.220
Jinn and I…

00:14:52.350 --> 00:14:53.929
We are boyfriends.

00:15:54.342 --> 00:15:55.336
Where should we start?

00:15:58.888 --> 00:15:59.868
I’ll sweep the floor.

00:16:00.618 --> 00:16:01.880
You go get the mop.

00:16:04.112 --> 00:16:04.656
Okay.

00:16:05.112 --> 00:16:05.672
Come on.

00:16:11.727 --> 00:16:12.581
Don’t flick it so hard.

00:16:13.249 --> 00:16:15.289
Well, I have to get the dust off.

00:16:16.511 --> 00:16:17.634
Let me sweep it.

00:16:20.877 --> 00:16:21.604
Hey!

00:16:21.962 --> 00:16:22.975
I’m dusting it.

00:16:37.065 --> 00:16:37.721
Oh!

00:16:41.833 --> 00:16:42.489
Hey!

00:16:44.599 --> 00:16:45.228
Farm!

00:16:51.224 --> 00:16:51.888
Farm!

00:16:53.061 --> 00:16:53.781
Stop it.

00:16:54.124 --> 00:16:55.959
Damn, I’m exhausted.

00:16:58.756 --> 00:17:00.178
Keep this up. You’ll get used to it.

00:17:01.139 --> 00:17:02.793
You can’t leave me.

00:17:03.103 --> 00:17:05.255
I definitely can’t do this alone.

00:17:05.907 --> 00:17:06.660
Mm.

00:17:09.023 --> 00:17:11.090
I should’ve stuck with housekeeping.

00:17:11.448 --> 00:17:13.844
You really picked the most tiring option.

00:17:14.626 --> 00:17:15.775
No need.

00:17:16.785 --> 00:17:18.122
Doing this is good.

00:17:21.446 --> 00:17:22.401
How is this good?

00:17:22.711 --> 00:17:23.696
It’s exhausting.

00:17:24.771 --> 00:17:26.924
It’s good because you’re not
afraid to come home anymore.

00:17:34.120 --> 00:17:34.640
That’s true.

00:17:36.354 --> 00:17:38.239
Anyway, no matter
how much you like your house,

00:17:38.239 --> 00:17:39.660
you can’t stop being my roommate.

00:17:40.507 --> 00:17:42.368
I still need someone to share the rent.

00:17:43.769 --> 00:17:47.610
If you only want me as a roommate,
I might need to think about it.

00:17:48.914 --> 00:17:49.912
Then what do you want to be?

00:17:51.362 --> 00:17:53.373
Someone by your side
for the rest of our lives.

00:17:54.106 --> 00:17:55.245
Someone who loves you.

00:17:55.766 --> 00:17:56.777
I want to be your boyfriend.

00:17:57.918 --> 00:18:02.632
And I want you to be mine.

00:18:21.398 --> 00:18:23.512
The audacity to do
that in front of my parents.

00:18:25.549 --> 00:18:26.238
Great.

00:18:26.988 --> 00:18:28.953
So your parents know I love you.

00:18:30.354 --> 00:18:31.262
Thank you.

00:18:31.930 --> 00:18:33.216
Something lifted for me today.

00:18:35.302 --> 00:18:35.945
That’s good.

00:18:38.080 --> 00:18:39.498
I’m happy for you.

00:18:39.710 --> 00:18:41.852
By the way, what about your family?

00:18:41.852 --> 00:18:43.193
Anything I can help you with?

00:18:48.375 --> 00:18:49.881
My family is too complicated.

00:18:50.533 --> 00:18:53.752
I’m already happy enough
that they don’t interfere with my life.

00:18:58.037 --> 00:18:59.587
If you really chose to leave them,

00:19:00.027 --> 00:19:01.419
I respect your decision.

00:19:02.657 --> 00:19:03.814
Let’s build a new one with me.

00:19:04.645 --> 00:19:05.354
Build a new one?

00:19:06.462 --> 00:19:07.162
A family.

00:19:08.074 --> 00:19:09.027
Build a family with me.

00:19:31.197 --> 00:19:32.957
People still decorate their houses like this?

00:19:33.169 --> 00:19:34.320
It looks really old.

00:19:35.526 --> 00:19:37.445
This used to be very trendy back in my day.

00:19:37.983 --> 00:19:39.209
Is it straight yet?

00:19:39.926 --> 00:19:40.820
Check the left side.

00:19:43.411 --> 00:19:44.121
How about this?

00:19:44.773 --> 00:19:46.429
No, that’s too high.

00:19:47.292 --> 00:19:47.963
What?

00:19:48.778 --> 00:19:50.228
Come on down, Dad. I’ll do it.

00:19:54.285 --> 00:19:55.811
Dad, step down. Let me do it.

00:20:15.228 --> 00:20:16.373
Dad, can you check if it’s straight?

00:20:16.829 --> 00:20:17.568
It is, son.

00:20:18.741 --> 00:20:19.383
Okay.

00:20:22.739 --> 00:20:23.820
Mom!

00:20:24.521 --> 00:20:25.445
What do we have here?

00:20:25.999 --> 00:20:26.780
Your favorite.

00:20:27.041 --> 00:20:28.219
Grilled prawns.

00:20:28.219 --> 00:20:29.214
That’s right.

00:20:29.703 --> 00:20:30.751
How many kilos?

00:20:37.767 --> 00:20:38.577
It’s starting.

00:20:38.984 --> 00:20:40.826
Everyone, let’s count down together.

00:20:40.826 --> 00:20:41.433
Okay.

00:20:41.873 --> 00:20:45.140
Ten, nine, eight, seven…

00:20:45.531 --> 00:20:50.219
Six, five, four, three, two, one.

00:20:50.594 --> 00:20:53.784
Happy New Year!

00:20:53.882 --> 00:20:54.723
Good year to you.

00:20:54.723 --> 00:20:56.499
Good year to you too.

00:20:56.499 --> 00:20:57.763
Hope we all stay healthy.

00:21:03.521 --> 00:21:04.470
- Guys.
- Hm?

00:21:05.228 --> 00:21:06.262
I have an announcement.

00:21:06.751 --> 00:21:07.491
Yeah?

00:21:11.597 --> 00:21:12.814
Well…

00:21:17.820 --> 00:21:19.201
Jinn and I…

00:21:20.456 --> 00:21:22.183
We’re boyfriends.

00:21:27.574 --> 00:21:29.230
- Oh, duh.
- Come on.

00:21:29.572 --> 00:21:31.392
Who doesn’t know that?

00:21:31.392 --> 00:21:32.440
That’s right.

00:21:34.268 --> 00:21:35.228
Let’s cheers!

00:21:35.228 --> 00:21:37.593
Cheers!

00:21:48.038 --> 00:21:50.047
Come on. You already
turned down my New Year trip idea.

00:21:50.228 --> 00:21:52.182
I need a trip! I need a trip!

00:21:52.915 --> 00:21:53.779
Where do you want to go?

00:21:54.838 --> 00:21:55.545
I want…

00:21:56.425 --> 00:21:57.082
Say it.

00:21:57.082 --> 00:21:57.928
How about the beach?

00:21:58.042 --> 00:21:59.636
I want to get in the water.

00:22:00.451 --> 00:22:01.221
The beach again?

00:22:01.221 --> 00:22:02.241
The beach?

00:22:02.388 --> 00:22:03.520
Are you free next week?

00:22:04.009 --> 00:22:06.225
But isn’t next week J and Jinn’s birthday?

00:22:06.453 --> 00:22:08.105
Shouldn’t you be with your families?

00:22:08.920 --> 00:22:09.575
No.

00:22:10.064 --> 00:22:12.075
Our parents are off to Europe
for half a month.

00:22:12.352 --> 00:22:13.225
It still hurts.

00:22:13.404 --> 00:22:14.224
How could they do that to us?

00:22:14.403 --> 00:22:15.511
They totally left us.

00:22:15.628 --> 00:22:16.934
That means you guys are free.

00:22:18.086 --> 00:22:18.677
So how about that trip?

00:22:19.621 --> 00:22:20.347
Yay!

00:22:21.602 --> 00:22:23.187
So what beach should we hit?

00:22:23.562 --> 00:22:24.771
What about the Maldives?

00:22:24.771 --> 00:22:25.698
- That’s too far.
- The beach?

00:22:27.474 --> 00:22:30.312
If you truly did your best,
then there’s nothing to be afraid of.

00:22:36.080 --> 00:22:36.709
J.

00:22:37.230 --> 00:22:37.865
J!

00:22:41.319 --> 00:22:43.918
If we’re going to the beach,
there’s this one place I want to go.

00:22:44.537 --> 00:22:45.139
Where?

00:22:53.085 --> 00:22:53.878
What is this?

00:22:53.878 --> 00:22:54.709
Is that a tower?

00:22:57.463 --> 00:22:58.429
I want to go there.

00:23:00.368 --> 00:23:02.967
What’s the name of this resort?

00:23:04.434 --> 00:23:06.700
You expect us to know
the place from your drawing?

00:23:07.401 --> 00:23:08.396
But this looks kind of familiar.

00:23:09.357 --> 00:23:10.727
It’s like the place my mom
took me to when I was young.

00:23:19.147 --> 00:23:20.431
Everything happened

00:23:21.164 --> 00:23:23.232
because of the wishes you made.

00:23:24.177 --> 00:23:24.969
Make it wish already.

00:23:25.751 --> 00:23:26.997
I wish you were back.

00:24:24.046 --> 00:24:25.585
We’ve finally met.

00:24:28.401 --> 00:24:29.273
Shit! What is this?

00:24:31.209 --> 00:24:34.356
You’ve done well to make it this far.

00:24:35.001 --> 00:24:36.136
Everything is over now.

00:24:36.957 --> 00:24:40.168
From here on, I hope you live a happy life.

00:24:41.889 --> 00:24:43.427
All the visions I saw…

00:24:44.053 --> 00:24:45.126
That was you?

00:24:45.791 --> 00:24:46.936
Why are you so shocked?

00:24:47.327 --> 00:24:48.463
I am you.

00:24:50.066 --> 00:24:51.712
I don’t fully understand what you mean,

00:24:53.569 --> 00:24:57.470
but thank you so much for
giving me the chance to fix things.

00:24:58.174 --> 00:24:59.433
Thank yourself.

00:25:00.430 --> 00:25:01.875
Everything happened

00:25:02.579 --> 00:25:04.493
because of the wishes you made.

00:25:05.901 --> 00:25:07.684
So what happens after this?

00:25:08.407 --> 00:25:09.606
Will everyone be safe?

00:25:10.760 --> 00:25:12.284
If you truly did your best,

00:25:12.949 --> 00:25:14.280
then there’s nothing to be afraid of.

00:25:21.338 --> 00:25:21.915
J.

00:25:23.597 --> 00:25:24.372
J.

00:25:25.584 --> 00:25:26.503
J, wake up.

00:25:28.517 --> 00:25:29.206
We’re here.

00:25:38.655 --> 00:25:39.588
Mai.

00:26:02.010 --> 00:26:02.893
Thank you.

00:26:04.242 --> 00:26:06.146
I promise I’ll love Jinn the best way I can.

00:26:19.497 --> 00:26:20.168
J.

00:26:22.886 --> 00:26:24.321
Can I get money for the keycard deposit?

00:26:33.397 --> 00:26:34.108
I love you.

00:26:36.164 --> 00:26:37.419
Yeah, I know that.

00:26:38.866 --> 00:26:39.809
I love you.

00:26:51.417 --> 00:26:52.193
Do you have five hundred?

00:26:53.249 --> 00:26:54.241
I need it for the deposit.

00:26:58.738 --> 00:27:00.039
I love you so damn much.

00:27:15.412 --> 00:27:17.238
Now I’ll have to ask
for more than five hundred.

00:27:23.945 --> 00:27:24.956
What now?

00:27:26.481 --> 00:27:27.572
I love you.

00:27:28.882 --> 00:27:29.556
Mm.

00:27:31.687 --> 00:27:33.682
What about you? Do you love me?

00:27:34.738 --> 00:27:35.655
Of course I do.

00:27:36.769 --> 00:27:37.798
I’ve loved you way before you did.

00:27:46.024 --> 00:27:46.628
Let’s go.

00:27:46.628 --> 00:27:47.673
We need to pay the deposit,

00:27:47.673 --> 00:27:48.399
or someone else will take our room.

00:27:48.399 --> 00:27:48.899
Come on.

00:27:49.466 --> 00:27:50.157
Let’s go.

00:27:59.199 --> 00:28:00.865
Well, well.

00:28:01.178 --> 00:28:02.473
Aren’t you so smooth?

00:28:03.314 --> 00:28:04.389
What are you talking about?

00:28:04.604 --> 00:28:06.214
This isn’t your room.

00:28:06.820 --> 00:28:07.675
Oh, please.

00:28:07.812 --> 00:28:09.866
The word “friend” is pretty short, huh?

00:28:11.372 --> 00:28:12.553
Shorter than “boyfriend.”

00:28:12.553 --> 00:28:13.270
Oops!

00:28:13.622 --> 00:28:14.663
Shorter than “boyfriend.”

00:28:15.034 --> 00:28:16.146
Let’s go, babe.

00:28:16.830 --> 00:28:18.041
Will you be okay, Mai?

00:28:18.256 --> 00:28:20.057
Oh, he will.

00:28:20.057 --> 00:28:22.029
Wow. Thanks for asking.

00:28:31.265 --> 00:28:32.411
Don’t you feel bad for him?

00:28:32.685 --> 00:28:34.261
The bed’s big. We can all share.

00:28:37.233 --> 00:28:38.298
I don’t.

00:28:39.021 --> 00:28:43.195
Because tonight I’m spending
a sweet time with my boyfriend.

00:28:44.993 --> 00:28:46.307
I have no idea what you’re playing.

00:28:48.380 --> 00:28:52.060
Alright. Then I’ll stop playing.

00:28:53.194 --> 00:28:54.099
Can I kiss you?

00:28:54.676 --> 00:28:55.176
Huh?

00:29:28.942 --> 00:29:32.244
This side of you surprises me.

00:29:33.261 --> 00:29:35.770
You’re the only one who gets to see it.

00:29:58.700 --> 00:30:00.934
You wanted to come here
because you dreamed about that bridge?

00:30:07.918 --> 00:30:09.686
And you dreamed about the other you?

00:30:11.504 --> 00:30:12.146
Mm.

00:30:16.213 --> 00:30:17.162
What did he say?

00:30:19.489 --> 00:30:21.123
He said everything was over

00:30:21.807 --> 00:30:23.560
and wished that I’d live my life happily.

00:30:25.965 --> 00:30:27.457
Does that mean you won’t
have those dreams anymore?

00:30:29.314 --> 00:30:30.402
I don’t know.

00:30:33.413 --> 00:30:34.687
That might actually be a good thing.

00:30:35.352 --> 00:30:36.333
How?

00:30:36.841 --> 00:30:39.009
If I never see visions of the future again

00:30:39.244 --> 00:30:41.510
and something happens to you,
how would I help you?

00:30:42.370 --> 00:30:43.078
Hey.

00:30:43.841 --> 00:30:45.691
Taking good care of each other is enough.

00:30:46.375 --> 00:30:49.006
Whatever happens, let it happen.

00:30:50.062 --> 00:30:53.919
You’ve lived with
that superpower for too long.

00:30:54.818 --> 00:30:57.768
Now you’re back to living a normal life.

00:30:57.846 --> 00:30:58.530
That’s all.

00:31:12.425 --> 00:31:13.610
He told me one more thing.

00:31:14.822 --> 00:31:15.569
What?

00:31:17.720 --> 00:31:22.830
“Make him feel sure
that what happened wasn’t pity,

00:31:25.196 --> 00:31:26.820
but because we truly love him.”

00:31:34.715 --> 00:31:35.235
Mm,

00:31:36.643 --> 00:31:37.408
I get it now.

00:31:45.927 --> 00:31:49.051
- Cheers!
- Cheers!

00:31:49.051 --> 00:31:51.097
Down it goes, birthday boys.

00:31:54.881 --> 00:31:56.893
Drink it. Drink it.

00:31:57.049 --> 00:31:59.100
Bottoms up, birthday boys.

00:31:59.100 --> 00:32:00.505
Wow! That’s awesome.

00:32:02.480 --> 00:32:04.039
That’s my boys.

00:32:04.156 --> 00:32:04.807
Nice work.

00:32:05.022 --> 00:32:06.566
Who mixed this? It’s so strong.

00:32:10.561 --> 00:32:11.561
My throat’s burning.

00:32:11.561 --> 00:32:13.065
Gosh, nature’s calling.

00:32:13.065 --> 00:32:15.631
Hey, buddy, you shouldn’t go alone.

00:32:15.631 --> 00:32:16.753
I’ll come with you.

00:32:16.753 --> 00:32:17.979
Come on, buddy.

00:32:18.546 --> 00:32:19.512
I don’t eat chocolate cake, guys.

00:32:20.724 --> 00:32:22.803
- Sheesh.
- Sheesh.

00:32:22.803 --> 00:32:24.849
Just play dumb, dipshit.

00:32:24.966 --> 00:32:26.191
Ow!

00:32:26.485 --> 00:32:27.247
I’m hungry.

00:32:35.792 --> 00:32:36.714
So what’s up with you?

00:32:37.574 --> 00:32:38.074
Hm?

00:32:39.052 --> 00:32:39.830
Same old.

00:32:40.182 --> 00:32:41.305
Has Van stopped being an ass?

00:32:41.930 --> 00:32:43.777
He’s been so good it even surprises me.

00:32:43.973 --> 00:32:45.433
I never thought he could be this lovely.

00:32:47.466 --> 00:32:48.649
Are you telling or bragging?

00:32:51.543 --> 00:32:53.656
Good. I’m happy for you.

00:32:54.125 --> 00:32:56.423
You finally found a good love,
like everyone else.

00:32:56.931 --> 00:32:57.649
Thanks.

00:32:58.255 --> 00:33:00.520
Having him makes me feel lucky.

00:33:01.146 --> 00:33:02.797
Ugh, I just wanna puke.

00:33:04.002 --> 00:33:04.903
Let’s open it.

00:33:05.744 --> 00:33:07.449
Yeah, nice.

00:33:08.094 --> 00:33:09.613
Wait, how many candles should we put on?

00:33:09.613 --> 00:33:11.175
Just use all of them.

00:33:11.175 --> 00:33:13.953
Really? Sounds like a fire hazard.

00:33:13.953 --> 00:33:15.949
As many as your love for Farm.

00:33:16.668 --> 00:33:17.723
Hey. Hey.

00:33:18.251 --> 00:33:19.653
Asshole, don’t ruin it.

00:33:20.611 --> 00:33:21.789
Are you nuts?

00:33:22.024 --> 00:33:23.932
I really hate you, dude.

00:33:24.792 --> 00:33:26.600
Do it nicely.

00:33:26.796 --> 00:33:28.433
I was just joking.

00:33:28.433 --> 00:33:30.234
You can light the candles.

00:33:30.234 --> 00:33:31.945
Over here too. There’s still space.

00:33:31.945 --> 00:33:35.014
Yeah. Then right here… and here. Two more.

00:33:38.045 --> 00:33:42.703
♪ Happy birthday to you ♪

00:33:43.348 --> 00:33:47.698

00:33:47.874 --> 00:33:53.491
♪ Happy birthday, happy birthday ♪

♪ Happy birthday to you ♪

00:34:00.139 --> 00:34:02.293
Happy birthday, my dear friends.

00:34:02.293 --> 00:34:03.360
Thank you.

00:34:08.463 --> 00:34:10.004
Come on, make a wish

00:34:10.004 --> 00:34:10.614
before the candles go out.

00:34:17.301 --> 00:34:18.123
Make a wish.

00:34:21.560 --> 00:34:22.757
I wish you were back.

00:34:24.204 --> 00:34:26.095
What the heck are you wishing for?

00:34:26.329 --> 00:34:27.540
You’re taking forever.

00:34:33.171 --> 00:34:33.782
Jinn.

00:34:35.366 --> 00:34:36.311
Yes, it’s me.

00:34:36.995 --> 00:34:38.209
You look like you just saw a ghost.

00:34:39.128 --> 00:34:40.596
I wish I could fix this.

00:34:43.040 --> 00:34:45.320
I wish we had more time to love each other.

00:34:47.842 --> 00:34:49.511
I wish everything…

00:34:52.326 --> 00:34:53.710
didn’t end this way.

00:34:55.098 --> 00:34:55.914
Make a wish.

00:35:01.133 --> 00:35:03.266
I wish we could be together
on every birthday,

00:35:04.928 --> 00:35:06.533
and stay together forever.

00:35:07.413 --> 00:35:10.335
I wish every wish
Jerome makes would come true.

00:35:19.179 --> 00:35:20.383
Thank you, guys.

00:35:21.419 --> 00:35:23.394
Let’s eat it.

00:35:31.650 --> 00:35:33.665
Let’s leave the past in the past.

00:35:34.799 --> 00:35:36.244
Let’s start over, yeah?

00:36:03.197 --> 00:36:06.895
Yeah! Drink up.

00:36:08.141 --> 00:36:10.015
No, not me!

00:36:15.980 --> 00:36:16.928
Your turn.

00:36:20.197 --> 00:36:21.725
Whoa!

00:36:22.501 --> 00:36:23.498
Look at his face.

00:36:23.641 --> 00:36:25.774
Drink all. Drink all.

00:36:28.103 --> 00:36:28.969
What are you doing?

00:36:31.237 --> 00:36:33.864
Kiss him. Kiss him.

00:36:34.974 --> 00:36:36.664
Yeah!

00:37:02.319 --> 00:37:04.118
Thank you, babe.

00:37:04.751 --> 00:37:05.635
For what?

00:37:06.759 --> 00:37:08.979
For taking care of me.

00:37:10.225 --> 00:37:11.939
You’re my boyfriend.

00:37:12.143 --> 00:37:13.289
Of course, I take care of you.

00:37:17.007 --> 00:37:18.101
Thank you again.

00:37:19.695 --> 00:37:20.195
What?

00:37:21.503 --> 00:37:24.850
Thank you for loving me.

00:37:26.443 --> 00:37:27.824
Thank you too.

00:37:40.989 --> 00:37:43.848
It’s good that we’ve had our sweet time.

00:37:44.297 --> 00:37:46.674
Because right now I’m so drunk.

00:37:47.144 --> 00:37:48.615
What are you even saying?

00:37:49.350 --> 00:37:50.202
Eiei.

00:37:51.591 --> 00:37:53.180
I love you.

00:38:01.075 --> 00:38:02.238
You should sleep.

00:38:06.059 --> 00:38:07.488
Sleep properly.

00:38:33.001 --> 00:38:34.320
Why did you come out here?

00:38:35.914 --> 00:38:37.141
To think about stuff.

00:38:38.796 --> 00:38:39.639
What stuff?

00:38:40.497 --> 00:38:41.462
Were you thinking about me?

00:38:44.731 --> 00:38:47.099
I was wondering how
I ended up with you as my boyfriend.

00:38:48.795 --> 00:38:51.008
Wasn’t I your target from the start?

00:38:51.008 --> 00:38:52.859
Ouch, that hurts.

00:38:53.778 --> 00:38:55.295
When I said I hated you back then,

00:38:55.479 --> 00:38:57.232
I meant it.

00:38:59.050 --> 00:38:59.832
Hey.

00:39:01.650 --> 00:39:03.290
You were obnoxious.

00:39:03.290 --> 00:39:04.355
You loved messing with me.

00:39:10.525 --> 00:39:11.967
Because I didn’t realize
my feelings back then.

00:39:13.418 --> 00:39:15.163
I just wanted your attention.

00:39:17.390 --> 00:39:19.516
Let’s leave the past in the past.

00:39:20.476 --> 00:39:21.904
Let’s start over.

00:39:25.151 --> 00:39:26.508
Right now, I love you.

00:39:28.122 --> 00:39:29.165
So much.

00:39:33.721 --> 00:39:34.705
I know that.

00:39:34.971 --> 00:39:36.008
You keep saying that.

00:39:36.887 --> 00:39:40.607
If there were a word
that meant more, I’d use it.

00:39:41.588 --> 00:39:42.787
Don’t be so cheesy.

00:39:43.890 --> 00:39:45.091
Well, it’s true.

00:39:59.604 --> 00:40:00.256
What are you doing?

00:40:02.565 --> 00:40:05.982
Are you sure you want me to say it?

00:40:37.472 --> 00:40:38.218
J.

00:40:39.709 --> 00:40:40.493
Yes?

00:40:51.880 --> 00:40:52.808
Jerome.

00:40:57.303 --> 00:40:57.989
Please.

00:41:03.090 --> 00:41:04.237
Pretty please.

00:41:24.925 --> 00:41:26.289
I love you, Jinn.

00:41:28.066 --> 00:41:29.334
I love you too.

00:41:57.696 --> 00:41:58.609
Why?

00:41:58.813 --> 00:42:01.462
Why hasn’t my partner been delivered yet?

00:42:03.257 --> 00:42:04.059
When?

00:42:04.243 --> 00:42:06.652
When will I ever get a partner?

00:42:08.641 --> 00:42:09.985
This is unbearable.

00:42:10.945 --> 00:42:12.473
I’m suffering so much.

00:42:13.372 --> 00:42:15.312
I might as well die.

00:42:15.557 --> 00:42:16.406
Oh, shit.

00:42:18.449 --> 00:42:21.179
Nope, I won’t die. It hurts.

00:42:29.148 --> 00:42:30.291
Why?

00:43:09.471 --> 00:43:10.635
Wake up.

00:43:20.549 --> 00:43:23.686
If you don’t wake up, I’ll…

00:43:25.686 --> 00:43:26.378
I’m up.

00:43:28.748 --> 00:43:30.132
Van asked if we wanted to
go down to the water.

00:43:30.561 --> 00:43:31.440
Huh?

00:43:34.852 --> 00:43:38.844
Watching the sunrise with
your boyfriend is so romantic, right?

00:43:39.314 --> 00:43:40.216
Right, love?

00:43:40.808 --> 00:43:41.660
Hey!

00:43:43.764 --> 00:43:45.298
You’re not the only ones in love.

00:43:45.298 --> 00:43:46.609
We love each other too.

00:43:46.609 --> 00:43:48.076
Right, darling?

00:43:57.331 --> 00:43:58.186
Dammit!

00:44:00.004 --> 00:44:02.669
Love each other all you want, guys.

00:44:03.343 --> 00:44:06.232
But wherever you go, take me with you too.

00:44:06.870 --> 00:44:07.700
I’m begging you.

00:44:08.599 --> 00:44:10.220
Of course, my friend.

00:44:10.220 --> 00:44:11.022
Thank you.

00:44:11.022 --> 00:44:11.890
Don’t forget me.

00:44:18.407 --> 00:44:19.008
Hey!

00:44:19.560 --> 00:44:21.416
We’re at the beach. Let’s get in the water.

00:44:21.416 --> 00:44:22.693
Stop being so lovey-dovey.

00:44:22.693 --> 00:44:23.193
Get up.

00:44:25.726 --> 00:44:27.289
Come on, you two.

00:44:28.127 --> 00:44:30.213
You can act all cheesy in the water.

00:44:30.213 --> 00:44:31.016
Come.

00:45:51.892 --> 00:45:53.090
The oil is splashing

00:45:53.090 --> 00:45:54.938
because the pan is still dry.

00:45:54.938 --> 00:45:57.506
(Wet! The pan is still wet.)

00:45:58.711 --> 00:46:00.134
The egg. Damn it!

00:46:00.420 --> 00:46:00.950
Jeez!

00:46:01.175 --> 00:46:02.541
(Alright. Cut!)

00:46:03.542 --> 00:46:04.516
Why is this so sour?

00:46:09.011 --> 00:46:10.716
(Cut.)

00:46:14.250 --> 00:46:16.004
- Nine.
- What?

00:46:16.270 --> 00:46:17.151
It’s eight.

00:46:17.151 --> 00:46:19.214
(It’s eight. Let’s count again.)

00:46:19.521 --> 00:46:20.072
(Pull him close.)

00:46:23.178 --> 00:46:24.064
I’m sorry.

00:46:24.289 --> 00:46:25.812
(Cut, let’s start over.)

00:46:25.955 --> 00:46:28.296
J is burning up.

00:46:29.052 --> 00:46:30.715
He’s really burning up.

00:46:30.899 --> 00:46:32.612
Being friends was already good enough.

00:46:32.816 --> 00:46:34.719
You prick. It’s all your fault.

00:46:37.007 --> 00:46:39.607
The doctor said I was fi…

00:46:39.607 --> 00:46:40.591
You were what?

00:46:40.591 --> 00:46:41.536
The doctor…

00:46:41.822 --> 00:46:42.787
I’m sorry.

00:46:42.787 --> 00:46:44.307
I’m sorry I was thinking that in my head.

00:46:44.430 --> 00:46:45.639
What did Mai suggest we eat?

00:46:46.701 --> 00:46:48.323
It’s “Mai asked if we
wanted to grab something to eat.”

00:46:48.323 --> 00:46:48.995
Sorry.

00:46:48.995 --> 00:46:49.878
What did Mai suggest we eat?
Holy cow!

00:46:56.591 --> 00:46:57.831
(Who’s coughing?)

00:46:58.566 --> 00:46:59.786
(Cut.)

00:46:59.786 --> 00:47:02.460
Are you choking on our love?

00:47:03.788 --> 00:47:05.267
(Okay, cut.)

00:47:05.614 --> 00:47:07.709
Did that hurt? No? I could hear the slap.

00:47:09.139 --> 00:47:09.971
(Cut.)

00:47:12.055 --> 00:47:12.841
Mom!

00:47:12.841 --> 00:47:13.537
Don’t.

00:47:14.150 --> 00:47:16.064
Please don’t.

00:47:20.195 --> 00:47:21.268
(Okay, cut.)

00:47:22.427 --> 00:47:23.315
(Cut.)

00:47:23.887 --> 00:47:25.042
It’s weird.

00:47:25.042 --> 00:47:26.652
It’s so weirdly unrealistic.

00:47:28.062 --> 00:47:29.509
So weirdly unrealistic?

00:47:31.640 --> 00:47:33.452
Did he swap souls with someone?

00:47:33.452 --> 00:47:34.085
Sure.

00:47:34.085 --> 00:47:37.141
Maybe he woke up and, like in a K-drama,
swapped souls with someone.

00:47:37.488 --> 00:47:38.624
Whose soul do you think it was?

00:47:38.624 --> 00:47:39.124
(Cut.)

00:47:39.124 --> 00:47:40.275
Yes, cut already.

00:47:40.275 --> 00:47:41.269
I’m out of ideas.

00:47:41.759 --> 00:47:42.629
Please, Heaven.

00:47:42.629 --> 00:47:44.615
Please bring Van back to us.

00:47:44.901 --> 00:47:45.925
What “Heaven” are you talking about?

00:47:45.925 --> 00:47:47.009
I’ve been watching Me and Thee too much.

00:47:47.009 --> 00:47:47.832
(Cut.)

00:47:48.175 --> 00:47:48.925
Heaven?

00:47:50.396 --> 00:47:51.138
Promise?

00:47:51.567 --> 00:47:52.225
We’re men.

00:47:52.225 --> 00:47:53.032
Of course, we make pinky promises.

00:47:53.911 --> 00:47:54.722
How about a cheek-kiss promise instead?

00:47:54.722 --> 00:47:55.282
Let’s just go.

00:47:55.384 --> 00:47:55.903
Cheek kiss?

00:47:55.903 --> 00:47:57.433
- Kiss my cheek.
- Let’s go.

00:47:59.537 --> 00:48:00.037
Let’s go.

00:48:00.916 --> 00:48:02.554
No. Carry me.

00:48:02.677 --> 00:48:03.538
Carry what?

00:48:04.008 --> 00:48:05.246
Come on. Do it.

00:48:05.614 --> 00:48:07.630
My arm’s just healed.
