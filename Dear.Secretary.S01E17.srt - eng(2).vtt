00:01:12.799 --> 00:01:14.200
Why use my photo

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:15.799
to sign up for dating apps?

00:01:16.120 --> 00:01:16.719
Also,

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:18.159
I'm clearly not thirty years old.

00:01:18.159 --> 00:01:18.959
I'm twenty-nine.

00:01:18.959 --> 00:01:19.879
I've said it so many times.

00:01:21.599 --> 00:01:22.239
Alright. (Support Admin Watch on
kissasia.cam or kisskh.org)

00:01:22.439 --> 00:01:23.200
I don't mind.

00:01:23.359 --> 00:01:24.560
But I do!

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:27.000
It's not the first time.

00:01:27.079 --> 00:01:28.079
Is she really my biological mother?

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:29.840
Don't be angry.

00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:30.799
Look.

00:01:50.879 --> 00:01:51.840
Don't just stand there.

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:52.400
Let's go.

00:04:28.079 --> 00:04:28.879
Little brother.

00:04:29.959 --> 00:04:30.720
Don't be afraid.

00:04:37.839 --> 00:04:38.759
Are you okay?

00:04:41.160 --> 00:04:41.959
It's okay.

00:04:42.519 --> 00:04:43.399
However,

00:04:43.879 --> 00:04:45.279
you were really amazing today.

00:04:46.800 --> 00:04:47.600
Really?

00:04:48.399 --> 00:04:49.160
Yes.

00:04:49.839 --> 00:04:50.920
Very commanding.

00:04:50.920 --> 00:04:51.879
You charmed me.

00:04:52.839 --> 00:04:53.959
Compared to what others say,

00:04:54.920 --> 00:04:56.360
I trust my own feelings more.

00:04:57.439 --> 00:04:59.199
Not because you are my boyfriend,

00:04:59.560 --> 00:05:01.079
but because

00:05:01.079 --> 00:05:01.839
you are you.

00:05:02.399 --> 00:05:03.519
My dear Secretary.

00:05:10.040 --> 00:05:11.439
What wish did you just make?

00:05:12.519 --> 00:05:13.360
I won't tell you.

00:05:13.759 --> 00:05:14.959
It won't come true if I say it out loud.

00:05:15.920 --> 00:05:16.720
Alright.

00:05:17.519 --> 00:05:20.240
Then the heart-fluttering date spot is the amusement park.

00:05:20.240 --> 00:05:20.680
Achieved.

00:05:21.079 --> 00:05:23.079
Favorite snack is cotton candy. Achieved.

00:05:23.519 --> 00:05:24.639
The most wanted gift

00:05:24.639 --> 00:05:25.879
is a puppy balloon. Achieved.

00:05:26.759 --> 00:05:27.879
The ideal boyfriend is

00:05:27.879 --> 00:05:29.319
gentle and considerate.

00:05:30.160 --> 00:05:31.319
Barely achieved.

00:05:32.279 --> 00:05:35.600
Then the most wanted confession method is...

00:05:35.879 --> 00:05:37.040
You wouldn't...

00:05:37.160 --> 00:05:37.959
Shh.

00:05:39.319 --> 00:05:40.079
Three.

00:05:40.519 --> 00:05:41.199
Two.

00:05:41.480 --> 00:05:42.000
One.

00:06:00.680 --> 00:06:01.800
I love you.

00:06:02.040 --> 00:06:02.720
Qin Meili.

00:06:07.160 --> 00:06:07.879
I can't hear you.

00:06:08.560 --> 00:06:09.319
I love you!

00:06:09.600 --> 00:06:10.399
Can't hear you!

00:06:10.439 --> 00:06:11.120
I love you!

00:06:11.120 --> 00:06:11.800
I love you!

00:06:11.800 --> 00:06:12.560
I love you, Qin Meili!

00:06:42.839 --> 00:06:43.639
Meili.

00:06:45.680 --> 00:06:46.839
There's something

00:06:47.519 --> 00:06:48.720
I've always wanted to tell you.

00:06:50.560 --> 00:06:51.560
Didn't I say?

00:06:52.040 --> 00:06:53.279
When you want to tell me,

00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:55.079
just tell me then.

00:06:56.839 --> 00:06:59.639
Although I don't know if it's necessary,

00:07:00.759 --> 00:07:02.120
but since someone cares,

00:07:02.680 --> 00:07:03.480
I still want to...

00:07:03.480 --> 00:07:04.560
Are you going to tell me

00:07:05.240 --> 00:07:06.360
how you managed

00:07:06.920 --> 00:07:08.680
to make the usually lively amusement park

00:07:08.879 --> 00:07:10.759
empty on a weekend?

00:07:11.959 --> 00:07:13.000
You knew everything.

00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:14.879
It's Lin Hai.

00:07:16.600 --> 00:07:17.959
Remember that year I just returned to China,

00:07:19.040 --> 00:07:20.759
Qin Group was already insolvent,

00:07:21.279 --> 00:07:22.480
and almost declared bankruptcy.

00:07:23.639 --> 00:07:25.160
So I made a deal with my dad,

00:07:25.879 --> 00:07:26.959
that as long as he let me take over,

00:07:27.680 --> 00:07:28.439
within a year,

00:07:28.439 --> 00:07:30.279
I would definitely turn Qin Group's losses into profits.

00:07:31.360 --> 00:07:33.199
But actually, I was gambling back then too.

00:07:34.399 --> 00:07:36.319
So the first thing I did upon entering the company

00:07:36.879 --> 00:07:38.680
was to find a reasonable helper.

00:07:39.920 --> 00:07:41.199
At this time, you appeared.

00:07:42.319 --> 00:07:43.560
You perfectly fit

00:07:43.560 --> 00:07:44.639
all my requirements.

00:07:46.319 --> 00:07:47.519
But facing a resume

00:07:47.600 --> 00:07:49.759
with very little personal information,

00:07:50.279 --> 00:07:51.920
I think no one wouldn't be curious.

00:07:52.480 --> 00:07:53.480
We've checked it out.

00:07:53.480 --> 00:07:54.639
It's the youngest son of the Lin Group.

00:07:54.959 --> 00:07:55.920
Because of a marriage issue,

00:07:55.920 --> 00:07:56.920
he cut ties with his family.

00:07:57.079 --> 00:07:58.319
He really needs this money now.

00:07:59.040 --> 00:08:00.120
In the past,

00:08:00.600 --> 00:08:01.120
this was called elopement.

00:08:01.920 --> 00:08:03.720
He's a pretty good young man.

00:08:04.720 --> 00:08:05.759
The Lin Group

00:08:06.079 --> 00:08:07.480
isn't a competing company of ours.

00:08:07.680 --> 00:08:08.360
But,

00:08:08.519 --> 00:08:09.959
the fact that he hid his resume

00:08:10.360 --> 00:08:11.199
isn't quite compliant.

00:08:12.240 --> 00:08:13.279
I don't know what he wants to do.

00:08:13.759 --> 00:08:14.560
President Qin,

00:08:14.879 --> 00:08:15.720
you decide.

00:08:17.199 --> 00:08:18.199
Okay, I know.

00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:20.160
This matter,

00:08:20.519 --> 00:08:22.160
I hope only you and I know.

00:08:22.439 --> 00:08:23.560
Or rather,

00:08:24.040 --> 00:08:25.240
only I know.

00:08:25.680 --> 00:08:26.759
Yes, understood.

00:08:28.480 --> 00:08:29.920
This is Secretary Lin's girlfriend.

00:08:30.199 --> 00:08:31.959
They say their relationship is very good.

00:08:32.840 --> 00:08:34.559
The girl is going abroad to study next week.

00:08:34.759 --> 00:08:36.039
With his current salary,

00:08:36.279 --> 00:08:37.679
it won't be easy to afford.

00:08:39.840 --> 00:08:40.639
Xiao Gu.

00:08:41.559 --> 00:08:42.879
Secretary Lin's salary

00:08:43.360 --> 00:08:44.840
needs to be raised by 50%.

00:08:45.200 --> 00:08:45.960
Also,

00:08:46.720 --> 00:08:48.000
the apartment they live in,

00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:48.679
buy it.

00:08:49.120 --> 00:08:50.960
The rent Secretary Lin pays from now on,

00:08:51.279 --> 00:08:52.639
deposit it into his salary account

00:08:52.639 --> 00:08:53.600
as a performance bonus.

00:08:54.159 --> 00:08:54.960
President Qin,

00:08:55.240 --> 00:08:56.200
isn't this inappropriate?

00:08:59.320 --> 00:09:00.480
Do you have any objections?

00:09:08.679 --> 00:09:09.679
You've done well.

00:09:10.600 --> 00:09:12.279
But recently some shareholders said

00:09:12.600 --> 00:09:13.879
that new secretary

00:09:14.120 --> 00:09:14.960
has a lot of authority.

00:09:15.559 --> 00:09:17.200
Like files that are exclusive company secrets,

00:09:17.519 --> 00:09:18.159
it's best

00:09:18.519 --> 00:09:19.480
not to let him know.

00:09:21.080 --> 00:09:21.879
Dad,

00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:24.399
this planning document

00:09:24.600 --> 00:09:25.759
was made by Secretary Lin.

00:09:28.039 --> 00:09:28.960
He made it?

00:09:32.200 --> 00:09:33.440
You trust him that much?

00:09:47.080 --> 00:09:47.799
Alright then.

00:09:52.080 --> 00:09:52.720
Actually,

00:09:53.399 --> 00:09:54.600
over these three years,

00:09:54.799 --> 00:09:56.480
I wasn't without my doubts about you.

00:09:57.279 --> 00:09:58.399
But strangely,

00:09:59.320 --> 00:10:00.320
you were always able

00:10:00.320 --> 00:10:01.440
to put my mind at ease.

00:10:02.559 --> 00:10:03.120
It wasn't until

00:10:03.960 --> 00:10:05.120
I truly had to face

00:10:05.120 --> 00:10:07.639
the fact that you might leave that I realized

00:10:09.879 --> 00:10:10.919
who you really are

00:10:10.919 --> 00:10:11.919
doesn't matter at all.

00:10:13.159 --> 00:10:14.840
Who I love is what matters most.

00:10:21.600 --> 00:10:23.399
I actually never knew

00:10:35.960 --> 00:10:38.240
it was Old Liu who prepared this special surprise for me.

00:10:38.679 --> 00:10:39.440
It's great, right?

00:10:44.159 --> 00:10:45.120
It's quite nice.

00:10:47.600 --> 00:10:49.360
This is so cheesy.

00:11:03.600 --> 00:11:05.440
I'm really happy today.

00:11:05.799 --> 00:11:07.080
Thank you.

00:11:07.679 --> 00:11:08.759
As long as you like it.

00:11:11.799 --> 00:11:12.480
Well then,

00:11:12.799 --> 00:11:15.399
let's leave it at this for now.

00:11:15.679 --> 00:11:16.480
See you tomorrow.

00:11:18.840 --> 00:11:19.639
See you tomorrow.

00:11:41.840 --> 00:11:42.639
What should I do?

00:11:43.879 --> 00:11:45.759
I really can't bear to wait until tomorrow to see you.

00:11:56.519 --> 00:11:57.840
What does this mean?

00:11:59.840 --> 00:12:01.559
Does it mean I should come in?

00:12:05.879 --> 00:12:07.039
Then I'll listen to you.

00:12:07.440 --> 00:12:08.320
Miss Meili.

00:12:08.960 --> 00:12:10.000
I'm coming in.

00:12:13.840 --> 00:12:14.279
Meili.

00:12:14.440 --> 00:12:15.039
Wait for me.
