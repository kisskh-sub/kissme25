WEBVTT

00:01:50.440 --> 00:01:53.800
The Western Market and East Market's commission can't be unified.

00:01:53.800 --> 00:01:54.930
Such a stupid thing.

00:01:55.080 --> 00:01:57.280
Why did you write a post for discussion?

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:08.360
The ruffians in the west market

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:10.000
must be out of their mind.

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:12.080
He even wants to share equal treatment

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:13.540
with the local officials.

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:18.850
My lord. My lord.

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:28.560
It's itchy.

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:29.320
Let me see.

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:32.140
This...

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:33.920
What happened?

00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:37.240
Get a doctor.

00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:38.400
Hurry! Hurry! Hurry! Hurry!

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:38.960
My lord.

00:02:39.320 --> 00:02:40.450
If you can't help it,

00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:41.480
Okay. Okay. Okay.

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:42.880
Like this. Like this.

00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:44.640
Look at my face.

00:02:44.960 --> 00:02:46.090
What if I scratch it?

00:02:54.640 --> 00:02:55.570
Why are you here?

00:02:56.400 --> 00:02:58.520
Ms. Yang was looking for a doctor.

00:02:58.680 --> 00:02:59.800
I knew you were allergic

00:02:59.800 --> 00:03:01.760
I knew you were allergic to flowers.

00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:03.240
So I went to the ice cellar

00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:04.290
and get some ice.

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:06.680
Ice compress can relieve the itchy.

00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:11.560
And this.

00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:13.770
What is this?

00:03:14.240 --> 00:03:15.080
This is...

00:03:15.240 --> 00:03:16.480
for allergy.

00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:17.890
It's from my family.

00:03:30.560 --> 00:03:31.079
My lord.

00:03:31.760 --> 00:03:33.560
It doesn't seem to be poisonous.

00:03:33.800 --> 00:03:35.400
Why would I poison him?

00:03:36.040 --> 00:03:37.170
Do you care about me?

00:03:38.360 --> 00:03:38.960
My lord.

00:03:39.320 --> 00:03:40.120
Hang in there.

00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:41.079
Here.

00:03:48.240 --> 00:03:48.480
How is it?

00:03:48.480 --> 00:03:48.800
Sir.

00:03:48.920 --> 00:03:49.780
How do you feel?

00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:50.960
It seems

00:03:51.760 --> 00:03:54.360
It's not tickly. It's tickly. It's not tickly.

00:03:54.640 --> 00:03:55.760
It's okay. It's okay. It's okay.

00:03:55.760 --> 00:03:56.360
Look.

00:03:56.800 --> 00:03:58.600
You must be allergic to flowers.

00:03:58.920 --> 00:04:00.240
My family grows flowers.

00:04:00.240 --> 00:04:02.360
It's no big deal.

00:04:07.520 --> 00:04:08.960
How did you

00:04:09.080 --> 00:04:10.280
in the mansion today?

00:04:10.480 --> 00:04:12.280
Why is Lord Fang allergic again?

00:04:13.320 --> 00:04:14.450
Steward, calm down.

00:04:14.640 --> 00:04:15.960
The flowers in the yard

00:04:16.120 --> 00:04:17.640
were carefully selected.

00:04:17.920 --> 00:04:19.120
They won't let adults

00:04:19.240 --> 00:04:20.560
allergic to it.

00:04:20.760 --> 00:04:21.440
This is...

00:04:21.440 --> 00:04:22.079
All right.

00:04:24.440 --> 00:04:27.120
These roses are very dangerous.

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:29.200
You can't touch them.

00:04:29.200 --> 00:04:30.000
thorns.

00:04:30.440 --> 00:04:31.880
It's a bad omen.

00:04:34.760 --> 00:04:35.440
Oh, right.

00:04:35.680 --> 00:04:36.680
And Mr. Bang.

00:04:36.680 --> 00:04:38.520
The roses in front of the bedroom.

00:04:38.520 --> 00:04:39.850
in front of the bedroom.

00:04:41.800 --> 00:04:43.120
What are you waiting for?

00:04:43.120 --> 00:04:43.980
Get rid of them!

00:04:44.320 --> 00:04:45.080
Yes.

00:04:45.240 --> 00:04:45.680
Let's go.

00:04:45.680 --> 00:04:46.320
Hurry.

00:04:46.880 --> 00:04:47.810
Look carefully.

00:04:48.320 --> 00:04:49.320
Ms. Yang.

00:04:49.680 --> 00:04:51.200
These dangerous flowers

00:04:51.640 --> 00:04:52.960
all these dangerous flowers

00:04:52.960 --> 00:04:54.120
to my room.

00:04:54.440 --> 00:04:55.880
After I deal with it,

00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:57.260
after I take care of it.

00:05:03.680 --> 00:05:04.120
Sir.

00:05:04.880 --> 00:05:05.480
What is it?

00:05:09.880 --> 00:05:10.880
You saved my life.

00:05:11.520 --> 00:05:12.450
What do you want?

00:05:14.880 --> 00:05:15.800
It's nothing.

00:05:16.320 --> 00:05:17.640
Don't worry about it.

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:19.260
As long as you are safe,

00:05:19.440 --> 00:05:21.000
as long as you are safe.

00:05:23.440 --> 00:05:25.240
I'm going to remove the flowers.

00:05:29.320 --> 00:05:30.800
I finally did something.

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:32.200
It's not that simple.

00:05:32.680 --> 00:05:33.200
She

00:05:33.440 --> 00:05:35.170
can save me in such a short time.

00:05:36.320 --> 00:05:38.440
it means she's always

00:05:39.200 --> 00:05:40.800
all the time.

00:05:41.560 --> 00:05:42.760
and love me deeply.

00:05:45.120 --> 00:05:46.580
I really don't understand

00:05:47.440 --> 00:05:48.440
the roses

00:05:48.640 --> 00:05:50.440
is such a dangerous flower.

00:05:54.560 --> 00:05:55.690
Put that over there.

00:05:56.200 --> 00:05:57.200
It's business.

00:05:57.200 --> 00:05:58.200
I'm just poor in information.

00:05:58.200 --> 00:05:58.880
Here too.

00:05:58.960 --> 00:05:59.800
I've observed

00:06:00.120 --> 00:06:01.320
the women in Chang'an

00:06:01.320 --> 00:06:02.560
are mostly

00:06:02.560 --> 00:06:04.000
to make flowers

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:04.880
decorations.

00:06:05.560 --> 00:06:07.000
The value of flowers

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:09.200
There's also a lot of excavation space.

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:10.860
The first step.

00:06:10.880 --> 00:06:11.800
Give flowers

00:06:11.800 --> 00:06:13.560
a special meaning.

00:06:13.960 --> 00:06:15.080
Come on

00:06:15.240 --> 00:06:16.440
Buy flowers.

00:06:17.200 --> 00:06:19.560
Lucky and wealthy peony.

00:06:19.560 --> 00:06:21.680
Everyone knows it.

00:06:21.880 --> 00:06:24.960
Lily is a flower that brings happiness.

00:06:25.320 --> 00:06:27.880
Whose girl is heartbroken by crying for love?

00:06:28.080 --> 00:06:29.120
The interpretation of lovesickness

00:06:29.120 --> 00:06:31.200
A red begonia will come.

00:06:31.200 --> 00:06:33.360
Wish love a happy ending.

00:06:33.680 --> 00:06:34.560
A mountain tea.

00:06:34.760 --> 00:06:37.080
The ideal love is by your side

00:06:37.360 --> 00:06:38.240
With roses,

00:06:38.360 --> 00:06:39.360
can attract

00:06:39.360 --> 00:06:41.000
a special flower of love.

00:06:41.320 --> 00:06:41.960
Girls,

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:44.240
Don't worry about your marriage.

00:06:45.440 --> 00:06:46.200
Why is this bouquet

00:06:46.200 --> 00:06:47.640
only one rose?

00:06:48.200 --> 00:06:50.560
One represents one love

00:06:50.560 --> 00:06:52.520
one and only love.

00:06:53.200 --> 00:06:54.240
I see.

00:06:54.240 --> 00:06:55.000
Then why

00:06:55.120 --> 00:06:56.440
only one rose?

00:06:56.440 --> 00:06:57.440
One mountain tea.

00:06:57.560 --> 00:06:58.680
Two represents

00:06:58.680 --> 00:07:01.320
One couple for life.

00:07:01.520 --> 00:07:04.120
Let's fly in pairs.

00:07:05.240 --> 00:07:05.880
Sure.

00:07:08.320 --> 00:07:09.000
I want one too.

00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:09.680
Me too.

00:07:10.320 --> 00:07:11.000
Step two.

00:07:11.320 --> 00:07:12.320
Mix sales.

00:07:12.680 --> 00:07:14.080
is to bind and sell.

00:07:14.320 --> 00:07:15.240
In a reasonable way

00:07:15.240 --> 00:07:16.300
in a reasonable way

00:07:16.440 --> 00:07:19.560
to make the people buy more products voluntarily.

00:07:26.440 --> 00:07:27.960
My lord was allergic to pollen

00:07:27.960 --> 00:07:29.200
seven days ago.

00:07:30.200 --> 00:07:31.560
He keeps sneezing.

00:07:32.120 --> 00:07:33.200
Too many sneezes

00:07:33.440 --> 00:07:35.000
I lost my energy.

00:07:35.760 --> 00:07:37.080
so he stopped eating.

00:07:39.440 --> 00:07:40.440
I'm allergic.

00:07:41.080 --> 00:07:42.120
Not passed away

00:07:45.440 --> 00:07:46.900
I suddenly had an allergy.

00:07:49.440 --> 00:07:50.640
This is very strange.

00:07:53.680 --> 00:07:54.640
Where is that scourge?

00:07:54.640 --> 00:07:55.440
A few days ago,

00:07:55.760 --> 00:07:57.120
when Lord Tao was allergic,

00:07:57.120 --> 00:07:58.440
she came to deliver medicine.

00:07:58.440 --> 00:07:59.120
and ice.

00:07:59.520 --> 00:08:01.120
Somehow,

00:08:01.120 --> 00:08:02.240
she's gone.

00:08:04.120 --> 00:08:05.120
Are you allergic?

00:08:05.240 --> 00:08:06.900
She'll give you the medicine.

00:08:07.440 --> 00:08:08.640
to cure your illness.

00:08:09.080 --> 00:08:10.080
Every time.

00:08:10.640 --> 00:08:12.100
Wind and electric switch.

00:08:13.640 --> 00:08:14.200
How could she

00:08:14.200 --> 00:08:15.320
your allergy time

00:08:15.320 --> 00:08:16.560
is so accurate.

00:08:20.960 --> 00:08:21.360
She...

00:08:21.760 --> 00:08:22.820
She's a scoundrel.

00:08:27.320 --> 00:08:31.680
One coin, two coins, three coins, four coins, five coins

00:08:31.680 --> 00:08:34.120
Six coins, seven coins, eight coins

00:08:34.320 --> 00:08:35.679
Nine coins. Ten coins.

00:08:38.799 --> 00:08:39.960
How much

00:08:40.960 --> 00:08:43.039
in this bag?

00:08:44.800 --> 00:08:47.160
Zheng, you're great.

00:08:48.960 --> 00:08:49.680
Be careful.

00:08:52.600 --> 00:08:53.460
Mr. Bang, look.

00:08:53.800 --> 00:08:54.960
I can make money.

00:08:55.480 --> 00:08:56.440
Just make money.

00:08:56.680 --> 00:08:58.480
What's wrong with our chairman?

00:09:02.960 --> 00:09:03.920
I wrote it carefully.

00:09:03.920 --> 00:09:05.280
about the flower shop in Chang'an.

00:09:05.280 --> 00:09:06.340
Show it to Mr. Bang.

00:09:07.040 --> 00:09:07.900
But Mr. Bang...

00:09:08.040 --> 00:09:09.300
He's been ignoring me.

00:09:10.440 --> 00:09:11.960
Should I prove to the chairman

00:09:11.960 --> 00:09:12.890
to the president

00:09:13.200 --> 00:09:14.400
I have the potential to do business

00:09:14.400 --> 00:09:15.200
and brain.

00:09:15.480 --> 00:09:16.400
I can work

00:09:16.400 --> 00:09:17.460
with the chairman.

00:09:17.600 --> 00:09:18.200
Besides,

00:09:18.480 --> 00:09:20.080
How did I hurt your chairman?

00:09:20.480 --> 00:09:21.810
It's just a few sneezes.

00:09:22.200 --> 00:09:23.000
It's not hurt.

00:09:28.720 --> 00:09:29.920
What are you doing?

00:09:30.160 --> 00:09:31.440
Uncertified management.

00:09:31.440 --> 00:09:32.500
Illegal business.

00:09:32.680 --> 00:09:34.410
and confiscated all the money.

00:09:35.200 --> 00:09:36.840
How is it illegal

00:09:37.160 --> 00:09:38.280
How is it illegal?

00:09:38.560 --> 00:09:39.620
Do you understand?

00:09:39.920 --> 00:09:40.980
The rules are dead.

00:09:41.160 --> 00:09:42.160
People are alive.

00:09:43.200 --> 00:09:44.260
without evidence.

00:09:44.440 --> 00:09:45.680
and disrupt the market order.

00:09:45.680 --> 00:09:47.080
and affect social security.

00:09:47.080 --> 00:09:48.200
This is a good thing

00:09:48.200 --> 00:09:49.800
who pay the stall fees

00:09:49.960 --> 00:09:50.680
is unfair.

00:09:50.720 --> 00:09:51.320
Besides,

00:09:51.680 --> 00:09:52.960
you hurt others' bodies.

00:09:52.960 --> 00:09:54.080
for hurting others.

00:09:54.080 --> 00:09:55.080
Do you feel proud?

00:09:55.800 --> 00:09:56.860
What can you prove?

00:09:57.200 --> 00:09:58.400
People die for money.

00:09:58.440 --> 00:09:59.680
for money?

00:10:00.480 --> 00:10:01.200
Li,

00:10:01.480 --> 00:10:02.080
Can you agree

00:10:02.080 --> 00:10:03.480
this way of making money?

00:10:08.080 --> 00:10:09.800
I'm just a helpless

00:10:09.920 --> 00:10:11.440
and helpless.

00:10:12.440 --> 00:10:13.800
I'm different from you.

00:10:14.480 --> 00:10:15.160
I worked so hard

00:10:15.160 --> 00:10:16.680
because I have no way back.

00:10:17.560 --> 00:10:18.620
Do you understand?

00:10:19.560 --> 00:10:20.820
You have no way out now.

00:10:21.080 --> 00:10:22.200
It's your fault.

00:10:33.480 --> 00:10:34.680
You deserve it.

00:10:35.200 --> 00:10:36.280
Great job, Lord Xu.

00:10:41.480 --> 00:10:42.320
Hit me.

00:10:50.320 --> 00:10:51.680
Bastard!

00:10:52.960 --> 00:10:54.290
No matter how hard it is,

00:10:54.400 --> 00:10:56.930
and always make things difficult for others.

00:10:58.840 --> 00:10:59.400
My lord.

00:10:59.720 --> 00:11:01.200
Why are we out so late?

00:11:02.200 --> 00:11:04.040
This scoundrel goes alone at night.

00:11:04.040 --> 00:11:05.240
If anything happens,

00:11:05.600 --> 00:11:06.720
it's on my house.

00:11:07.440 --> 00:11:08.480
It's better to be careful.

00:11:08.480 --> 00:11:09.740
You're so thoughtful.

00:11:10.440 --> 00:11:11.680
But sir,

00:11:11.680 --> 00:11:13.160
What should we do?

00:11:13.960 --> 00:11:15.620
Lift the sedan chair forward.

00:11:15.960 --> 00:11:16.840
and go with her.

00:11:17.680 --> 00:11:18.280
Yes.

00:11:18.600 --> 00:11:20.080
This way, it'll be safer.

00:11:26.680 --> 00:11:28.080
Why are you following me?

00:11:28.080 --> 00:11:29.400
I'm afraid something might happen to you.

00:11:29.400 --> 00:11:30.200
Our house

00:11:30.200 --> 00:11:32.000
can't take the responsibility.

00:11:32.160 --> 00:11:33.200
I want to be alone.

00:11:33.560 --> 00:11:34.420
Leave me alone.

00:11:35.680 --> 00:11:36.160
Look.

00:11:36.800 --> 00:11:37.960
Playing hard to get again.

00:11:37.960 --> 00:11:38.420
My lord.

00:11:38.440 --> 00:11:39.680
What should we do?

00:11:40.040 --> 00:11:41.040
Let's play along.

00:11:41.560 --> 00:11:42.960
Lift the sedan chair forward.

00:11:42.960 --> 00:11:44.480
She will definitely stop us.

00:11:44.480 --> 00:11:45.200
Speed up.

00:11:45.200 --> 00:11:45.960
Surpass her!

00:11:47.200 --> 00:11:48.260
Yes, Young Master.

00:11:48.320 --> 00:11:49.380
Hurry up, you guys.

00:11:59.960 --> 00:12:00.440
Husppy

00:12:01.400 --> 00:12:02.480
Is she panicking?

00:12:04.320 --> 00:12:04.800
My lord.

00:12:05.040 --> 00:12:06.480
She didn't react at all.

00:12:06.600 --> 00:12:08.200
She walks with her head down.

00:12:09.080 --> 00:12:10.840
You're trying to get me off the sedan

00:12:10.840 --> 00:12:11.970
Let me off the sedan.

00:12:13.040 --> 00:12:15.160
This woman does have a plan.

00:12:16.160 --> 00:12:17.440
This is a psychological war.

00:12:17.440 --> 00:12:18.200
Keep going.

00:12:19.080 --> 00:12:20.600
She can't wait to catch up.

00:12:21.400 --> 00:12:21.860
My lord.

00:12:21.960 --> 00:12:23.160
There's a turn. Okay.

00:12:23.960 --> 00:12:24.820
Then slow down.

00:12:29.400 --> 00:12:31.960
There are so many people carrying it. Why are you walking so slowly?

00:12:31.960 --> 00:12:33.690
How can I cry if you don't leave?

00:12:36.800 --> 00:12:37.560
I'm fine.

00:12:37.840 --> 00:12:38.840
You guys go first.

00:12:39.680 --> 00:12:40.160
My lord.

00:12:40.160 --> 00:12:41.490
She was crying just now.

00:12:41.720 --> 00:12:42.800
Why did she laugh?

00:12:43.080 --> 00:12:44.960
This is the 36 strategies.

00:12:45.720 --> 00:12:46.780
Never compromise.

00:12:48.320 --> 00:12:49.200
Keep going.

00:12:53.400 --> 00:12:54.840
Is the chassis unstable?

00:12:54.960 --> 00:12:56.620
Why are you walking so slowly?

00:13:00.960 --> 00:13:01.440
My lord.

00:13:01.600 --> 00:13:02.800
She's squatting now.

00:13:04.400 --> 00:13:04.920
Stop.

00:13:12.920 --> 00:13:13.440
My lord.

00:13:13.680 --> 00:13:14.480
She's crying.

00:13:20.200 --> 00:13:21.040
Let's go back.

00:13:22.400 --> 00:13:24.000
Find someone to protect her.

00:13:24.560 --> 00:13:25.800
Don't let her find out.

00:13:25.800 --> 00:13:26.320
Yes.

00:13:55.560 --> 00:13:56.560
Why are you here?

00:14:01.280 --> 00:14:01.880
All right.

00:14:02.560 --> 00:14:04.280
I know I made you allergic.

00:14:04.720 --> 00:14:06.280
and took the flowers in your house.

00:14:06.280 --> 00:14:07.080
It's my fault.

00:14:07.680 --> 00:14:08.840
I apologize.

00:14:09.480 --> 00:14:11.280
But I'm really tired today.

00:14:11.840 --> 00:14:13.320
Can you scold me tomorrow?

00:14:14.680 --> 00:14:16.140
I didn't mean to scold you.

00:14:17.320 --> 00:14:19.400
Are you chasing me away?

00:14:21.600 --> 00:14:22.720
Can I go tomorrow?

00:14:25.200 --> 00:14:26.860
I'm not trying to kick you out.

00:14:26.960 --> 00:14:28.290
Then what are you doing?

00:14:29.200 --> 00:14:31.560
Are you going to kill me to silence me?

00:14:33.560 --> 00:14:33.960
What

00:14:33.960 --> 00:14:35.480
thinking about every day.

00:14:36.560 --> 00:14:39.160
I just heard you cry so sadly.

00:14:40.200 --> 00:14:40.960
So

00:14:41.680 --> 00:14:42.560
to see you.

00:14:44.680 --> 00:14:46.200
You don't blame me

00:14:46.560 --> 00:14:48.080
or angry with me.

00:14:49.400 --> 00:14:50.200
I know.

00:14:51.320 --> 00:14:52.850
You wanted to pretend to cry

00:14:53.080 --> 00:14:54.410
to make me soft-hearted

00:14:54.560 --> 00:14:56.480
and let me get off the sedan to comfort you.

00:14:56.480 --> 00:14:58.200
But I didn't expect

00:14:58.840 --> 00:15:00.170
to leave you on the night

00:15:00.440 --> 00:15:02.040
and made you cry so sadly.

00:15:02.560 --> 00:15:03.280
But...

00:15:03.960 --> 00:15:05.020
it's late at night.

00:15:06.960 --> 00:15:08.020
I was thoughtless.

00:15:08.600 --> 00:15:10.680
So I came to explain to you.

00:15:11.960 --> 00:15:12.720
I know.

00:15:13.400 --> 00:15:14.800
you are like other women.

00:15:15.200 --> 00:15:16.320
like other women.

00:15:16.680 --> 00:15:17.800
and wanted to marry me.

00:15:17.800 --> 00:15:18.800
But compared to other women,

00:15:18.800 --> 00:15:19.800
with other women,

00:15:19.840 --> 00:15:20.720
more eager.

00:15:20.960 --> 00:15:22.090
Playing hard to get.

00:15:22.560 --> 00:15:24.320
and pretend to want to learn.

00:15:24.320 --> 00:15:25.380
the way of business

00:15:25.680 --> 00:15:26.560
to me.

00:15:27.160 --> 00:15:28.760
You poisoned me with pollen.

00:15:29.320 --> 00:15:31.280
You want to help me

00:15:32.080 --> 00:15:33.280
and let me accept you?

00:15:34.200 --> 00:15:35.400
Wait, mister.

00:15:35.480 --> 00:15:36.080
I...

00:15:37.280 --> 00:15:37.960
I know.

00:15:38.720 --> 00:15:39.840
I expose you

00:15:39.840 --> 00:15:40.720
expose you,

00:15:41.200 --> 00:15:42.660
you must defend yourself.

00:15:42.840 --> 00:15:43.840
You don't have to.

00:15:44.080 --> 00:15:45.160
You don't have to

00:15:45.680 --> 00:15:46.680
Don't bother.

00:15:47.080 --> 00:15:48.440
You can tell me frankly.

00:15:48.800 --> 00:15:49.960
you love me.

00:15:50.480 --> 00:15:52.400
You can't get rid of me.

00:15:55.960 --> 00:15:56.440
You...

00:15:56.800 --> 00:15:57.860
What are you doing?

00:15:58.600 --> 00:15:59.730
You need to be rough.

00:15:59.840 --> 00:16:01.040
and force me to yield.

00:16:03.160 --> 00:16:04.320
Separate hatred.

00:16:04.480 --> 00:16:05.840
You are the chairman of the Chamber of Commerce.

00:16:05.840 --> 00:16:07.600
What are you thinking about?

00:16:07.800 --> 00:16:09.530
Can't you focus on your career?

00:16:10.040 --> 00:16:11.600
I get up early and work hard

00:16:11.600 --> 00:16:12.960
I work hard to get rich.

00:16:13.400 --> 00:16:14.260
What about you?

00:16:14.320 --> 00:16:15.200
always

00:16:15.200 --> 00:16:16.560
all day long.

00:16:17.040 --> 00:16:17.680
The 36 strategies

00:16:17.680 --> 00:16:19.680
are all used for lust and imagination.

00:16:19.680 --> 00:16:21.040
I talk about business with you.

00:16:21.040 --> 00:16:22.570
You talk about love with me.

00:16:25.800 --> 00:16:26.860
Listen carefully.

00:16:27.320 --> 00:16:29.200
I tried so hard to get into your house

00:16:29.200 --> 00:16:30.330
to do something big.

00:16:30.680 --> 00:16:31.320
If you keep

00:16:31.320 --> 00:16:32.280
like this,

00:16:32.680 --> 00:16:34.080
I don't need you to kick me out.

00:16:34.080 --> 00:16:35.410
I'll stay away from you.

00:16:35.600 --> 00:16:36.330
Understand?

00:16:39.680 --> 00:16:41.140
Don't make me despise you.

00:16:41.440 --> 00:16:42.500
Do you understand?

00:16:57.200 --> 00:16:58.560
You bastard!

00:17:05.680 --> 00:17:06.680
Oh no.

00:17:08.839 --> 00:17:10.640
I'm sorry.

00:17:12.160 --> 00:17:14.040
Why did he have to

00:17:14.040 --> 00:17:15.440
at a time like this.

00:17:16.200 --> 00:17:17.480
if you say that.

00:17:20.920 --> 00:17:22.839
If you keep this up,

00:17:25.680 --> 00:17:27.740
Am I really going to find another one?

00:17:35.440 --> 00:17:35.960
Li.

00:17:36.600 --> 00:17:37.800
Where's the trouble?

00:17:39.640 --> 00:17:40.300
Last night,

00:17:40.440 --> 00:17:41.440
He ran away from home.

00:17:41.440 --> 00:17:42.960
She cried a lot and came back.

00:17:42.960 --> 00:17:44.000
Why is she crying?

00:17:47.360 --> 00:17:48.490
She cried all night.

00:17:49.160 --> 00:17:49.640
No.

00:17:50.440 --> 00:17:51.200
Well...

00:17:51.720 --> 00:17:53.720
I was walking on the street late at night.

00:17:53.720 --> 00:17:54.980
and refused to go home.

00:17:55.960 --> 00:17:57.200
What a disaster.

00:17:57.440 --> 00:17:58.900
How could someone do this?

00:18:00.600 --> 00:18:01.860
disregarding the law.

00:18:01.960 --> 00:18:02.960
Shameless!

00:18:03.280 --> 00:18:04.240
You hurt others and yourself.

00:18:04.240 --> 00:18:05.280
and selfish.

00:18:06.440 --> 00:18:06.960
Yes.

00:18:07.960 --> 00:18:08.960
Why is someone

00:18:09.280 --> 00:18:10.480
One in front of others.

00:18:10.480 --> 00:18:11.540
One after another.

00:18:11.920 --> 00:18:13.520
It's only right to say things wrong.

00:18:13.520 --> 00:18:14.050
Exactly.

00:18:14.680 --> 00:18:15.720
What a trouble.

00:18:16.680 --> 00:18:17.280
Scared?

00:18:17.760 --> 00:18:18.960
A demon?

00:18:18.960 --> 00:18:19.760
Monster?

00:18:20.440 --> 00:18:21.640
I heard that

00:18:21.760 --> 00:18:23.000
there is a demon in the mountain.

00:18:23.000 --> 00:18:24.260
It can bewitch people.

00:18:24.720 --> 00:18:25.200
Look.

00:18:25.600 --> 00:18:26.530
All the servants

00:18:26.600 --> 00:18:27.530
all the servants

00:18:27.640 --> 00:18:28.200
Except Husppy,

00:18:28.200 --> 00:18:29.400
Yang Lin and me,

00:18:29.600 --> 00:18:30.730
are all close to her.

00:18:31.400 --> 00:18:33.440
It makes sense

00:18:33.960 --> 00:18:36.200
makes sense.

00:18:37.240 --> 00:18:38.360
If not a demon,

00:18:38.600 --> 00:18:39.160
you wouldn't have been able to do that in such a short time.

00:18:39.160 --> 00:18:40.200
make so much money

00:18:40.200 --> 00:18:41.440
in such a short time.

00:18:41.760 --> 00:18:43.240
It's a magic trick. You're right. You're right.

00:18:43.240 --> 00:18:44.640
You're right. Let's go. Let's go.

00:18:44.640 --> 00:18:45.000
Look.

00:18:45.480 --> 00:18:46.200
The money on her desk

00:18:46.200 --> 00:18:47.520
is not a small amount

00:18:48.000 --> 00:18:49.200
is not a small amount.

00:18:50.760 --> 00:18:51.400
However,

00:18:52.280 --> 00:18:53.940
it's easy to deal with a human.

00:18:54.160 --> 00:18:55.040
A demon.

00:18:55.480 --> 00:18:56.410
What should I do?

00:18:56.640 --> 00:18:58.360
be bewitched by her?

00:18:58.440 --> 00:18:59.240
and marry her?

00:19:01.360 --> 00:19:02.480
I saw her sad.

00:19:02.960 --> 00:19:04.490
I actually had compassion.

00:19:05.440 --> 00:19:06.640
Ziqi, what about you?

00:19:06.920 --> 00:19:07.440
I...

00:19:09.360 --> 00:19:10.600
I feel bad too.

00:19:12.400 --> 00:19:13.480
But it doesn't matter.

00:19:13.480 --> 00:19:15.210
Justice is in people's hearts.

00:19:15.440 --> 00:19:16.000
To me,

00:19:16.360 --> 00:19:18.090
she just wants me to be with her.

00:19:18.720 --> 00:19:19.400
I'm afraid

00:19:20.200 --> 00:19:22.440
for you.

00:19:23.400 --> 00:19:24.480
She has cut me

00:19:24.600 --> 00:19:25.860
for the rest of my life.

00:19:29.360 --> 00:19:29.890
Monster!

00:19:31.960 --> 00:19:32.720
Evil!

00:19:46.760 --> 00:19:47.240
Boss.

00:19:47.960 --> 00:19:49.560
King of Hell's secret lover.

00:19:53.600 --> 00:19:55.480
But suddenly,

00:19:55.480 --> 00:19:56.920
a man in black outside the window

00:19:56.920 --> 00:19:58.240
stabbed King of Hell.

00:19:58.240 --> 00:19:59.440
but changed his move in the middle.

00:19:59.440 --> 00:20:01.960
and captured King of Hell's lover.

00:20:01.960 --> 00:20:03.680
The lover couldn't bear King of Hell being threatened.

00:20:03.680 --> 00:20:05.340
Hengdao will commit suicide.

00:20:05.400 --> 00:20:06.680
He said it was too late, but it was fast.

00:20:06.680 --> 00:20:08.240
The King of Hell cut out his sheath.

00:20:08.240 --> 00:20:09.280
and chopped the villain

00:20:09.280 --> 00:20:11.680
and the knife in his lover's hand.

00:20:11.680 --> 00:20:12.920
Then King of Hell

00:20:12.920 --> 00:20:14.520
held his lover.

00:20:14.600 --> 00:20:16.120
and roar loudly.

00:20:17.640 --> 00:20:18.680
Silly girl.

00:20:18.960 --> 00:20:20.200
Don't hurt yourself

00:20:20.200 --> 00:20:21.840
hurt yourself like this.

00:20:21.960 --> 00:20:24.720
I can't live without you.

00:20:25.400 --> 00:20:25.960
Tonight,

00:20:26.480 --> 00:20:28.200
leave me tonight.

00:20:29.120 --> 00:20:31.120
I want the moon in the city

00:20:31.400 --> 00:20:33.120
fall for you and me.

00:20:33.520 --> 00:20:36.240
King of Hell sent a sip of watermelon juice

00:20:36.480 --> 00:20:39.280
into the lover's mouth.

00:20:39.520 --> 00:20:41.440
And he drank

00:20:41.840 --> 00:20:43.240
Red date longan tea.

00:20:44.120 --> 00:20:46.880
They look at each other.

00:20:51.520 --> 00:20:52.960
I really admire

00:20:53.720 --> 00:20:55.280
such a good man.

00:20:55.640 --> 00:20:57.520
Stop pushing

00:20:57.760 --> 00:20:59.200
I can't get in.

00:20:59.440 --> 00:21:00.700
There's no space left.

00:21:00.760 --> 00:21:01.760
Pay now.

00:21:01.760 --> 00:21:03.620
Make a reservation in three days.

00:21:03.840 --> 00:21:05.400
I have money.

00:21:05.680 --> 00:21:06.240
Pay up.

00:21:06.720 --> 00:21:07.200
Come on.

00:21:07.200 --> 00:21:08.440
Here you are.

00:21:09.400 --> 00:21:10.330
This is my money.

00:21:10.640 --> 00:21:11.920
This is mine and mine.

00:21:21.120 --> 00:21:21.680
Ziqi.

00:21:22.200 --> 00:21:23.930
Why did you open the window too?

00:21:30.880 --> 00:21:32.280
Even you...

00:21:38.360 --> 00:21:39.360
It's too popular.

00:21:39.600 --> 00:21:40.660
By the way, read it.

00:21:41.000 --> 00:21:41.680
But

00:21:42.240 --> 00:21:43.700
is indeed extraordinary.

00:21:45.480 --> 00:21:46.400
It's late.

00:21:46.960 --> 00:21:48.360
What are you doing here?

00:21:48.960 --> 00:21:49.960
My home is surrounded.

00:21:49.960 --> 00:21:50.820
I can't go back.

00:21:55.400 --> 00:21:57.240
The content of this book

00:21:57.240 --> 00:21:58.440
is so real.

00:21:59.120 --> 00:22:00.920
But it's really fake.

00:22:01.280 --> 00:22:02.680
If I had

00:22:02.680 --> 00:22:04.920
with women,

00:22:05.440 --> 00:22:06.120
my child

00:22:06.120 --> 00:22:07.850
is enough to form a team to farm.

00:22:09.480 --> 00:22:10.480
That makes sense.

00:22:11.720 --> 00:22:12.640
Then

00:22:12.760 --> 00:22:14.200
What should we do? Let's go.

00:22:14.200 --> 00:22:15.000
Investigate.

00:22:15.200 --> 00:22:16.330
Investigate it now.

00:22:17.000 --> 00:22:18.200
and clear my name.

00:22:18.680 --> 00:22:20.280
and bring peace to Chang'an.

00:22:33.960 --> 00:22:36.280
This month's salt compared to last month,

00:22:36.280 --> 00:22:37.480
more than last month.

00:22:38.200 --> 00:22:39.530
The price hasn’t risen.

00:22:39.840 --> 00:22:42.000
27,000 bolts are missing

00:22:43.480 --> 00:22:45.600
but the price dropped by 30%.

00:22:46.040 --> 00:22:47.200
You have no idea.

00:22:47.880 --> 00:22:50.280
The salt in Huainan region in Shaanxi is missing.

00:22:50.280 --> 00:22:51.160
In three days,

00:22:51.160 --> 00:22:53.200
in three days.

00:22:53.720 --> 00:22:55.600
50,000 bolts of cloth

00:22:55.600 --> 00:22:57.200
50,000 bolts of cloth.

00:22:57.400 --> 00:22:59.520
The profit is more profitable

00:22:59.640 --> 00:23:00.840
by 40%.

00:23:23.960 --> 00:23:24.960
Mr. Bang,

00:23:25.680 --> 00:23:26.920
please forgive me this time.

00:23:26.920 --> 00:23:28.200
I won't do it again.

00:23:28.680 --> 00:23:29.400
The north of Huainan

00:23:29.400 --> 00:23:30.730
It's far from Chang'an.

00:23:31.680 --> 00:23:33.360
Why must you travel so far?

00:23:33.760 --> 00:23:35.120
to buy your salt

00:23:35.680 --> 00:23:36.610
to buy your salt.

00:23:37.640 --> 00:23:39.770
The amount of cloth in Henan in Guannei

00:23:40.120 --> 00:23:41.720
is twice as much as last year.

00:23:42.520 --> 00:23:43.980
I had to buy cloth from you.

00:23:44.200 --> 00:23:45.520
I was wrong.

00:23:46.200 --> 00:23:48.520
You fed your own pockets seven times.

00:23:49.000 --> 00:23:52.360
from salt, cloth, candles

00:23:52.360 --> 00:23:54.960
and even extracted silver from gold and silver.

00:23:54.960 --> 00:23:56.120
in total.

00:23:56.400 --> 00:23:57.960
7,895 taels.

00:24:00.960 --> 00:24:02.760
Fake accounts are full of flaws.

00:24:03.200 --> 00:24:05.000
How did you manage the business?

00:24:09.240 --> 00:24:09.840
Chairman.

00:24:10.360 --> 00:24:11.620
Here you go. Thank you.

00:24:15.120 --> 00:24:17.400
all your property.

00:24:17.720 --> 00:24:20.160
is about 4,000 taels of gold.

00:24:21.960 --> 00:24:23.200
The money I mentioned

00:24:24.160 --> 00:24:25.120
is not a penny less.

00:24:25.120 --> 00:24:26.440
to the Chamber of Commerce.

00:24:26.440 --> 00:24:27.120
Please

00:24:27.680 --> 00:24:28.810
please forgive him.

00:24:43.600 --> 00:24:44.730
Thank you, Mr. Bang.

00:24:55.760 --> 00:24:56.200
Sir.

00:24:57.040 --> 00:24:57.840
Send the money

00:24:58.040 --> 00:24:58.640
Send it to

00:24:58.640 --> 00:24:59.640
to your hometown.

00:25:00.440 --> 00:25:01.500
She's always mean.

00:25:02.280 --> 00:25:03.440
When you send it to her,

00:25:03.440 --> 00:25:04.570
say something nice.

00:25:05.160 --> 00:25:06.620
I know what you want to say.

00:25:07.480 --> 00:25:08.210
Don't worry.

00:25:08.880 --> 00:25:09.680
I'm not upset.

00:25:11.000 --> 00:25:12.460
Since they took my bullet,

00:25:13.440 --> 00:25:14.360
I can get

00:25:14.680 --> 00:25:15.440
what I want.

00:25:20.480 --> 00:25:22.280
His king of hell is domineering.

00:25:22.960 --> 00:25:23.960
The love released

00:25:24.200 --> 00:25:25.280
It's hot

00:25:25.680 --> 00:25:27.120
and suffocating.

00:25:27.920 --> 00:25:30.360
Every day when the King of Hell pushed the door,

00:25:30.360 --> 00:25:32.920
he can feel

00:25:33.200 --> 00:25:34.840
burning feelings.

00:25:35.240 --> 00:25:38.160
It's like he's a treasure that everyone wants.

00:25:38.600 --> 00:25:40.200
You must hold it in your hands

00:25:40.680 --> 00:25:42.200
in your heart.

00:25:42.680 --> 00:25:44.640
King of Hell holds her face

00:25:45.040 --> 00:25:46.200
and say it gently.

00:25:46.960 --> 00:25:47.720
In this world

00:25:48.880 --> 00:25:50.360
in this world.

00:25:51.040 --> 00:25:51.720
Write.

00:26:03.960 --> 00:26:06.360
King of Hell blushes when he sees his lover.

00:26:06.720 --> 00:26:08.200
and even unwilling to

00:26:08.840 --> 00:26:09.680
That pair

00:26:10.000 --> 00:26:12.060
looking at your lover passionately.

00:26:12.160 --> 00:26:13.880
A few drops of water

00:26:14.280 --> 00:26:14.840
Wait.

00:26:15.960 --> 00:26:17.280
Isn't it burning eyes?

00:26:17.760 --> 00:26:19.160
Why is it dripping again?

00:26:20.680 --> 00:26:21.680
That makes sense.

00:26:22.920 --> 00:26:24.360
Mr. Li is really amazing.

00:26:24.600 --> 00:26:25.720
You can catch me every time.

00:26:25.720 --> 00:26:26.880
Wrong language.

00:26:27.200 --> 00:26:27.880
Come on.

00:26:27.960 --> 00:26:29.220
Have some watermelon.

00:26:30.000 --> 00:26:30.720
Thank you.

00:26:31.280 --> 00:26:31.960
Thank you.

00:26:32.600 --> 00:26:33.400
Then...

00:26:35.040 --> 00:26:36.440
That burning eyes

00:26:37.160 --> 00:26:38.280
almost

00:26:38.280 --> 00:26:40.680
all over his body.

00:26:41.440 --> 00:26:42.600
This fire

00:26:43.360 --> 00:26:46.760
can burn the whole world.

00:26:49.360 --> 00:26:50.360
What do you think?

00:26:50.600 --> 00:26:51.280
How is it?

00:26:51.600 --> 00:26:52.260
Wonderful.

00:26:52.600 --> 00:26:53.600
You're talented.

00:26:53.760 --> 00:26:54.120
Sure.

00:26:54.120 --> 00:26:54.720
Wonderful

00:26:54.760 --> 00:26:56.360
Wonderful

00:27:05.680 --> 00:27:06.200
This...

00:27:07.040 --> 00:27:07.640
This...

00:27:11.400 --> 00:27:11.960
This...

00:27:12.840 --> 00:27:14.680
What's going on?

00:27:16.760 --> 00:27:17.200
You...

00:27:17.680 --> 00:27:19.040
Why are you here?

00:27:19.840 --> 00:27:20.760
Burn

00:27:21.040 --> 00:27:21.960
all the books.

00:27:22.040 --> 00:27:22.520
Yes.

00:27:25.680 --> 00:27:26.140
This...

00:27:37.240 --> 00:27:37.920
Don't!

00:27:40.160 --> 00:27:40.960
Don't burn it!

00:27:41.880 --> 00:27:42.440
Don't!

00:27:44.120 --> 00:27:44.920
Don't burn it.

00:27:46.960 --> 00:27:47.720
Don't.

00:27:58.360 --> 00:27:59.360
Hua Xiao Zheng.

00:27:59.840 --> 00:28:01.440
and disrupt social morale.

00:28:02.000 --> 00:28:03.680
Fabrication, slander,

00:28:03.960 --> 00:28:05.360
and slander others.

00:28:05.720 --> 00:28:07.580
All profits will be confiscated.

00:28:21.680 --> 00:28:23.000
Xu Ziqi.

00:28:25.960 --> 00:28:27.240
The world is vast.

00:28:27.840 --> 00:28:30.000
than you.

00:28:32.600 --> 00:28:34.120
Living is a waste of air.

00:28:34.720 --> 00:28:36.380
It's a waste of land if you die.

00:28:37.160 --> 00:28:38.960
You're so pedantic.

00:28:38.960 --> 00:28:40.440
Without the image of a pig,

00:28:40.600 --> 00:28:41.960
but he's capable.

00:28:54.760 --> 00:28:56.200
But he can't hear

00:28:56.520 --> 00:28:57.960
he can't hear me.

00:29:02.200 --> 00:29:03.840
I'll go find him now.

00:29:04.960 --> 00:29:06.440
and scold him face to face.

00:29:34.280 --> 00:29:35.280
Xu Xu.

00:29:35.880 --> 00:29:37.000
Xu Ziqi.

00:29:37.680 --> 00:29:39.760
You...

00:29:39.760 --> 00:29:40.640
Xu Ziqi.

00:29:42.440 --> 00:29:43.200
Hua Xiaochi.

00:29:43.440 --> 00:29:44.500
What are you doing?

00:29:48.840 --> 00:29:49.920
Xu Ziqi.

00:29:49.920 --> 00:29:51.200
What do you want?

00:29:52.160 --> 00:29:53.640
You want me to pay back your money?

00:29:53.640 --> 00:29:54.880
You don't want me to make money.

00:29:54.880 --> 00:29:56.280
Why don't you let me live?

00:29:57.200 --> 00:29:58.120
Hua Xiao Zheng!

00:30:07.960 --> 00:30:08.820
Hua Xiao Zheng!

00:30:09.120 --> 00:30:10.050
You crazy woman.

00:30:17.360 --> 00:30:19.200
I did beat you up.

00:30:19.520 --> 00:30:20.440
Then what?

00:30:23.920 --> 00:30:24.920
Good job. Good job.

00:30:24.920 --> 00:30:25.680
Nice punch.

00:30:26.280 --> 00:30:27.740
I should beat you to death.

00:30:44.000 --> 00:30:46.480
You bastard!

00:30:48.960 --> 00:30:51.440
How dare you keep private goods?

00:30:51.920 --> 00:30:52.440
Go ahead.

00:30:52.440 --> 00:30:52.920
I just...

00:30:52.920 --> 00:30:54.600
Burn what?

00:30:55.480 --> 00:30:55.960
I...

00:30:56.120 --> 00:30:57.000
Xu Ziqi.

00:30:57.400 --> 00:30:58.440
I'm not sick.

00:30:58.440 --> 00:30:59.880
It's you.

00:31:00.840 --> 00:31:02.440
I've hit you today.

00:31:02.680 --> 00:31:05.120
You made me lose money twice before.

00:31:05.640 --> 00:31:06.680
We're even.

00:31:07.200 --> 00:31:08.640
I came here

00:31:08.640 --> 00:31:10.160
to do something big.

00:31:10.680 --> 00:31:12.360
If you dare to stop me,

00:31:13.480 --> 00:31:15.920
I'll beat you to death.

00:31:18.000 --> 00:31:19.640
How dare you!

00:31:35.240 --> 00:31:36.100
Stop fighting.

00:31:36.960 --> 00:31:37.960
Let's make a deal.

00:31:40.240 --> 00:31:41.680
Condition?

00:31:42.840 --> 00:31:43.440
Okay.

00:31:43.960 --> 00:31:44.520
Okay.

00:31:47.760 --> 00:31:49.690
I won't lower myself to your level.

00:31:50.240 --> 00:31:51.040
It hurts so much.

00:31:51.040 --> 00:31:51.970
It hurts so much.

00:32:08.000 --> 00:32:09.060
Within seven days,

00:32:09.080 --> 00:32:09.360
within seven days.

00:32:09.360 --> 00:32:11.420
Hua Xiao Zheng will make enough money

00:32:11.680 --> 00:32:13.140
to pay the debt for Xu Ziqi.

00:32:13.600 --> 00:32:15.720
or I'll never come back

00:32:15.960 --> 00:32:17.090
and never come back.

00:32:17.760 --> 00:32:18.690
On the contrary,

00:32:18.880 --> 00:32:20.280
if you pay off your debts,

00:32:20.440 --> 00:32:23.960
Xu Ziqi runs naked in public.

00:32:28.280 --> 00:32:28.840
OK.

00:32:29.400 --> 00:32:30.240
Deal.

00:32:31.680 --> 00:32:32.840
After you leave Chang'an,

00:32:32.840 --> 00:32:33.760
after you leave Chang'an.

00:32:33.760 --> 00:32:34.960
It's a good choice.

00:32:36.200 --> 00:32:37.040
Wait and see.

00:32:43.960 --> 00:32:45.020
What are you doing?

00:32:46.760 --> 00:32:47.820
What are you doing?

00:32:48.200 --> 00:32:48.730
I'm here.

00:32:52.040 --> 00:32:53.120
Xu Ziqi.

00:32:53.640 --> 00:32:55.040
Aren't you a delinquent?

00:32:55.440 --> 00:32:56.970
Aren't you the King of Hell?

00:32:57.000 --> 00:32:58.260
Forget about the toes.

00:32:58.480 --> 00:33:00.160
Your fingers are like this too.

00:33:00.160 --> 00:33:01.640
Can't you cherish your life?

00:33:01.640 --> 00:33:02.960
Why did you cut it so deep?

00:33:02.960 --> 00:33:04.090
Hurry up and sign it.

00:33:14.720 --> 00:33:15.180
Come on.

00:33:23.360 --> 00:33:24.090
Pinky swear.

00:33:25.880 --> 00:33:26.610
Pinky swear.

00:33:27.960 --> 00:33:30.480
A gentleman never goes back on his word.

00:33:30.920 --> 00:33:32.320
I won't go back on my word.

00:33:33.400 --> 00:33:33.960
Okay.

00:33:46.280 --> 00:33:47.280
Separate hatred.

00:33:50.440 --> 00:33:50.920
What?

00:33:52.480 --> 00:33:53.280
Help!

00:33:54.000 --> 00:33:55.060
What are you doing?

00:33:56.840 --> 00:33:57.680
Help!

00:33:57.840 --> 00:33:58.640
Help!

00:33:59.240 --> 00:34:00.360
Help!

00:34:01.520 --> 00:34:02.240
Go ahead.

00:34:03.200 --> 00:34:04.680
No one will come to save you

00:34:04.880 --> 00:34:06.760
no one will come to save you.

00:34:07.280 --> 00:34:08.960
You'll ruin

00:34:08.960 --> 00:34:09.889
your innocence.

00:34:10.040 --> 00:34:10.600
You...

00:34:11.120 --> 00:34:12.800
You finally show yourself.

00:34:13.600 --> 00:34:14.520
You're finally going to kill me.

00:34:14.520 --> 00:34:15.280
Right?

00:34:16.120 --> 00:34:16.840
I knew it.

00:34:17.360 --> 00:34:18.889
you can't keep pretending.

00:34:18.960 --> 00:34:19.840
You wrote

00:34:19.840 --> 00:34:20.900
was written by you.

00:34:21.719 --> 00:34:23.360
Did you write this book

00:34:23.800 --> 00:34:25.260
to suppress your emotions

00:34:25.639 --> 00:34:26.239
to suppress your emotions

00:34:26.239 --> 00:34:27.159
to provoke me.

00:34:27.760 --> 00:34:29.290
Now everything is exposed.

00:34:29.480 --> 00:34:30.880
We're going to be a beast!

00:34:32.440 --> 00:34:32.880
No!

00:34:37.560 --> 00:34:38.620
What are you doing?

00:34:38.800 --> 00:34:40.000
Are you observing me?

00:34:40.440 --> 00:34:41.900
Looking for inspiration?

00:34:42.639 --> 00:34:44.120
You want me to be your male lead?

00:34:44.120 --> 00:34:46.050
You want me to be your secret lover?

00:34:47.920 --> 00:34:48.800
Cut the crap.

00:34:49.239 --> 00:34:49.880
Tell me.

00:34:50.280 --> 00:34:51.400
the quickest way

00:34:51.400 --> 00:34:52.260
in a short time.

00:35:09.800 --> 00:35:10.440
Work hard.

00:35:10.560 --> 00:35:11.360
Be humble.

00:35:11.520 --> 00:35:12.120
Thank you.

00:35:12.320 --> 00:35:13.080
For the dream

00:35:13.240 --> 00:35:14.240
Keep fighting

00:35:14.600 --> 00:35:16.000
Come on! Come on! Come on!

00:35:16.080 --> 00:35:17.360
Xu Ziqi.

00:35:17.520 --> 00:35:19.240
I'll kill you!

00:35:23.600 --> 00:35:24.240
My lord.

00:35:26.400 --> 00:35:26.840
Sir!

00:35:27.520 --> 00:35:28.840
That monster ran out.

00:35:29.800 --> 00:35:30.440
What for?

00:35:32.040 --> 00:35:32.920
I think so.

00:35:33.400 --> 00:35:34.960
with Lord Xu.

00:35:35.480 --> 00:35:36.240
Within seven days,

00:35:36.240 --> 00:35:37.400
in seven days

00:35:37.480 --> 00:35:38.720
to pay Mr. Xu's debt.

00:35:39.040 --> 00:35:41.240
Then we won't interfere with each other.

00:35:41.240 --> 00:35:42.080
That's it.

00:35:42.840 --> 00:35:43.240
In the novel,

00:35:43.240 --> 00:35:44.640
in the novel.

00:35:45.280 --> 00:35:46.760
It's true.

00:35:47.280 --> 00:35:47.800
Sir.

00:35:47.920 --> 00:35:49.560
Don't let that scourge succeed.

00:35:49.560 --> 00:35:51.040
If you don't ruin Lord Xu,

00:35:51.400 --> 00:35:52.440
if he doesn't.

00:35:55.920 --> 00:35:56.920
That makes sense.

00:35:59.840 --> 00:36:01.770
It's the same style as King of Hell.

00:36:04.400 --> 00:36:05.440
So beautiful.

00:36:06.960 --> 00:36:08.560
Red dates are good for blood.

00:36:08.600 --> 00:36:10.400
Goji berries replenish kidney.

00:36:10.440 --> 00:36:11.160
Real man.

00:36:11.400 --> 00:36:14.240
Red date longan goji berry tea

00:36:14.440 --> 00:36:15.700
Take some goji berries

00:36:16.480 --> 00:36:17.400
Drink more.

00:36:19.120 --> 00:36:21.050
It's the same style as King of Hell.

00:36:21.080 --> 00:36:22.720
Red dates to replenish blood.

00:36:22.720 --> 00:36:24.520
Goji berries replenish kidney.

00:36:24.880 --> 00:36:26.120
Real men drink

00:36:26.120 --> 00:36:28.640
Red date, wolfberry and longan tea.

00:36:28.920 --> 00:36:29.600
Come on.

00:36:29.760 --> 00:36:30.320
King of Hell.

00:36:30.320 --> 00:36:32.880
Hua Xiao Zheng.

00:36:38.760 --> 00:36:39.320
My lord.

00:36:39.640 --> 00:36:40.520
I've bought

00:36:40.520 --> 00:36:41.520
I bought them all.

00:36:41.800 --> 00:36:42.360
My lord.

00:36:42.440 --> 00:36:44.440
Did we buy too much?

00:36:44.920 --> 00:36:46.380
I need to buy more samples.

00:36:47.320 --> 00:36:47.960
By then,

00:36:48.160 --> 00:36:49.640
we can defeat

00:36:50.400 --> 00:36:51.440
in one go.

00:36:53.240 --> 00:36:54.400
You are so smart.

00:36:54.560 --> 00:36:55.960
Your Excellency is wise.

00:37:18.240 --> 00:37:19.240
Come on.

00:37:19.240 --> 00:37:21.640
Exclusive drink for the Queen of Hell.

00:37:21.960 --> 00:37:22.800
watermelon juice.

00:37:22.800 --> 00:37:25.360
It's good to relieve thirst.

00:37:25.360 --> 00:37:27.640
It's better than black tea and green tea.

00:37:27.640 --> 00:37:29.520
One cup a day and you look rosy.

00:37:29.520 --> 00:37:30.480
The water is tender.

00:37:30.480 --> 00:37:32.600
A pot of skin like snow a day.

00:37:32.600 --> 00:37:34.040
Soft.

00:37:34.280 --> 00:37:35.740
The babies of King of Hell.

00:37:36.040 --> 00:37:38.080
Whoever drinks will earn money.

00:37:38.080 --> 00:37:39.360
Come on.

00:37:39.840 --> 00:37:40.560
Give me one.

00:37:41.240 --> 00:37:41.920
I want one too.

00:37:41.920 --> 00:37:43.000
Everyone has one.

00:37:43.400 --> 00:37:44.440
I'll put the money here.

00:37:44.440 --> 00:37:45.040
Yama!

00:37:45.440 --> 00:37:46.560
The living Yama.

00:37:50.720 --> 00:37:52.200
Hua Xiao Zheng!

00:37:53.160 --> 00:37:54.480
Arrest her!

00:37:55.720 --> 00:37:56.240
Look!

00:37:56.520 --> 00:37:57.520
There's a meteor.

00:37:57.800 --> 00:37:58.720
What?

00:37:59.240 --> 00:37:59.840
What?

00:38:00.160 --> 00:38:01.000
What is it?

00:38:01.920 --> 00:38:02.360
Hurry!

00:38:02.400 --> 00:38:02.760
He ran away.

00:38:02.760 --> 00:38:03.120
Yes!

00:38:03.600 --> 00:38:04.330
Go after him!

00:38:04.640 --> 00:38:06.240
I finally meet him in person.

00:38:06.440 --> 00:38:07.520
So handsome!

00:38:09.160 --> 00:38:09.960
Yama!

00:38:14.280 --> 00:38:14.760
My Lord.

00:38:14.960 --> 00:38:15.600
I bought

00:38:15.600 --> 00:38:16.840
all the watermelon juice.

00:38:16.840 --> 00:38:17.320
Sir.

00:38:17.320 --> 00:38:18.380
You can't buy more.

00:38:18.480 --> 00:38:19.040
Buy more.

00:38:19.120 --> 00:38:20.760
Hua Xiaochi will be able to pay back

00:38:20.760 --> 00:38:21.690
Lord Xu's money.

00:38:23.440 --> 00:38:25.170
I don't want to spend the money.

00:38:26.040 --> 00:38:26.840
But...

00:38:27.120 --> 00:38:28.440
I won't go to hell. I won't go to hell.

00:38:28.440 --> 00:38:29.500
Who will go to hell?

00:38:29.800 --> 00:38:31.040
in case the people of Chang'an

00:38:31.040 --> 00:38:32.280
by Hua Xiaochi.

00:38:33.160 --> 00:38:33.920
I had to

00:38:34.440 --> 00:38:35.360
suffer alone.

00:38:36.160 --> 00:38:38.090
Your Excellency, you are so great.

00:38:40.440 --> 00:38:42.040
How much does she owe Lord Xu?

00:38:42.160 --> 00:38:43.800
I don't think so.

00:38:44.760 --> 00:38:45.280
Okay.

00:38:46.840 --> 00:38:47.440
My lord.

00:38:47.440 --> 00:38:48.370
You drink first.

00:39:01.480 --> 00:39:01.960
My lord.

00:39:01.960 --> 00:39:02.820
Take your time.

00:39:13.600 --> 00:39:15.320
watermelon seeds.

00:39:15.440 --> 00:39:17.480
It's delicious and tasty.

00:39:17.480 --> 00:39:19.240
It's so sweet.

00:39:19.520 --> 00:39:20.960
Every time when King of Hell

00:39:20.960 --> 00:39:22.760
fall asleep,

00:39:22.760 --> 00:39:24.440
[she would gently]

00:39:24.760 --> 00:39:25.960
watermelon seeds.

00:39:26.160 --> 00:39:29.440
Look at the face of King of Hell.

00:39:29.760 --> 00:39:31.320
At that time,

00:39:31.320 --> 00:39:33.800
is still so handsome and handsome.

00:39:33.800 --> 00:39:36.560
The same watermelon seeds as King of Hell.

00:39:38.720 --> 00:39:39.840
Give me one.

00:39:39.840 --> 00:39:40.640
I want one too.

00:39:40.640 --> 00:39:41.960
I want this. I want two.

00:39:43.360 --> 00:39:44.440
I paid for it.

00:39:44.800 --> 00:39:46.600
Oh my god.

00:39:47.000 --> 00:39:48.560
Xu Ziqi is so popular.

00:39:49.320 --> 00:39:51.400
This girl is so dark.

00:39:52.480 --> 00:39:54.560
I didn't expect her to be so popular.

00:39:55.720 --> 00:39:56.000
No king.

00:39:56.000 --> 00:39:56.860
Zigua, Xi King.

00:40:05.960 --> 00:40:06.480
Li,

00:40:06.960 --> 00:40:08.040
That scoundrel said

00:40:08.040 --> 00:40:09.760
asked me to go to the tea house tomorrow

00:40:09.760 --> 00:40:11.220
at the tea house tomorrow.

00:40:11.400 --> 00:40:12.860
He said he had enough money

00:40:13.320 --> 00:40:14.920
to break up with me in public.

00:40:15.000 --> 00:40:16.440
Let's part ways

00:40:16.440 --> 00:40:17.440
and be happy.

00:40:18.480 --> 00:40:19.040
Great.

00:40:23.000 --> 00:40:24.760
Why are you so happy?

00:40:26.160 --> 00:40:28.720
I like that you want to escape from the claw

00:40:28.960 --> 00:40:29.960
and feel happy.

00:40:32.600 --> 00:40:33.880
But if Hua

00:40:33.880 --> 00:40:35.240
breaks off with me,

00:40:35.720 --> 00:40:36.440
your next target

00:40:36.440 --> 00:40:37.320
is you.

00:40:38.240 --> 00:40:39.880
I can only sacrifice myself

00:40:39.960 --> 00:40:40.960
to protect you.

00:40:43.120 --> 00:40:44.120
Or,

00:40:44.960 --> 00:40:46.820
since I've been framed like this,

00:40:47.440 --> 00:40:48.080
why don't

00:40:48.360 --> 00:40:49.840
I'll suffer more.

00:40:51.080 --> 00:40:51.880
Good brother.

00:40:52.360 --> 00:40:54.490
we should share weal and woe together.

00:41:13.400 --> 00:41:14.000
By the way,

00:41:14.320 --> 00:41:15.000
I heard that

00:41:15.960 --> 00:41:17.560
Husppy's hometown.

00:41:17.720 --> 00:41:19.360
My cousin's puppy

00:41:19.760 --> 00:41:20.890
It's been ten years.

00:41:21.120 --> 00:41:22.920
and gave birth to a bunch of kids.

00:41:23.960 --> 00:41:24.520
Yes.

00:41:25.320 --> 00:41:28.480
That dog is indeed strong.

00:41:29.320 --> 00:41:31.080
I didn't expect that.

00:41:32.880 --> 00:41:33.760
Then...

00:41:34.600 --> 00:41:35.080
Li.

00:41:35.280 --> 00:41:36.080
Do you know?

00:41:36.160 --> 00:41:37.320
I heard that

00:41:37.400 --> 00:41:38.720
in the amusement park.

00:41:39.160 --> 00:41:39.760
Next time,

00:41:40.320 --> 00:41:41.380
let's go together.

00:41:42.240 --> 00:41:44.120
I've asked Husppy

00:41:44.440 --> 00:41:45.770
to prepare the tickets.

00:41:45.960 --> 00:41:46.840
It's autumn.

00:41:57.480 --> 00:41:58.480
I wonder

00:41:59.760 --> 00:42:01.560
what the scoundrel is doing now.

00:42:06.000 --> 00:42:06.880
Count money.

00:42:07.480 --> 00:42:09.340
Thinking about how to make money.

00:42:10.920 --> 00:42:11.960
I don't know

00:42:12.920 --> 00:42:13.920
if she still

00:42:14.560 --> 00:42:15.890
to count money tonight?

00:42:26.440 --> 00:42:27.960
Xu Ziqi.

00:42:28.360 --> 00:42:29.560
Wait and see.

00:42:42.560 --> 00:42:43.400
Coming.

00:43:02.840 --> 00:43:03.500
Hua Xiaochi

00:43:03.920 --> 00:43:04.850
What do you mean?

00:43:07.720 --> 00:43:09.520
Today, in front of everyone,

00:43:09.640 --> 00:43:11.120
in front of everyone.

00:43:11.640 --> 00:43:12.500
What about you?

00:43:12.640 --> 00:43:14.240
I admit defeat.

00:43:14.840 --> 00:43:16.240
He's here for you.

00:43:17.360 --> 00:43:17.920
Cheers.

00:43:17.920 --> 00:43:19.120
When you asked me out,

00:43:19.160 --> 00:43:20.440
you only said you would pay me back.

00:43:20.440 --> 00:43:21.240
Nothing else.

00:43:21.720 --> 00:43:22.650
What do you mean?

00:43:24.160 --> 00:43:26.160
You have to keep your promise.

00:43:28.720 --> 00:43:30.450
Where did you get so many girls?

00:43:32.160 --> 00:43:33.160
Tomorrow,

00:43:33.400 --> 00:43:35.240
then King of Hell will be here

00:43:35.560 --> 00:43:38.080
to meet the ladies here.

00:43:41.440 --> 00:43:43.240
and let you

00:43:43.240 --> 00:43:44.880
to experience

00:43:44.880 --> 00:43:46.120
what is

00:43:48.640 --> 00:43:50.880
the man of hell?

00:43:55.000 --> 00:43:56.320
The location is limited.

00:43:56.320 --> 00:43:57.720
First come first served.

00:43:57.920 --> 00:43:59.520
Only 30 copper cash

00:43:59.880 --> 00:44:00.920
One for tea.

00:44:00.960 --> 00:44:02.280
I want it.

00:44:02.280 --> 00:44:02.960
Stop.

00:44:03.360 --> 00:44:04.520
Besides the meeting,

00:44:04.520 --> 00:44:06.180
there's a handshake meeting.

00:44:06.240 --> 00:44:08.080
As long as everyone is enthusiastic,

00:44:08.080 --> 00:44:10.160
the king of hell can bring us home.

00:44:10.440 --> 00:44:12.720
Let me hear your enthusiasm.

00:44:20.640 --> 00:44:21.800
You're not getting away!

00:44:21.800 --> 00:44:23.960
Take me with you.

00:44:29.960 --> 00:44:31.560
Run together. Run together.

00:44:35.440 --> 00:44:36.560
Put me down!

00:44:37.920 --> 00:44:38.920
Put me down!

00:44:41.040 --> 00:44:43.280
He's really a good man.

00:44:56.200 --> 00:44:56.400
Actor table
