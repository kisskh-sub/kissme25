00:12:07.550 --> 00:12:08.250
I'll pay you double.

00:12:08.670 --> 00:12:09.820
Pay first, then call the cops,

00:12:10.200 --> 00:12:11.180
say I extorted you?

00:12:11.550 --> 00:12:12.820
I'm not touching that money.

00:12:15.120 --> 00:12:16.460
A man who has an affair

00:12:16.510 --> 00:12:17.300
with his subordinate's wife.

00:12:18.600 --> 00:12:19.650
What credibility does he have?

00:12:30.840 --> 00:12:31.980
We were only minutes from home.

00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:32.530
Why couldn't you

00:12:32.840 --> 00:12:33.890
hold it in?

00:12:41.080 --> 00:12:41.490
Fine. I'll pass.

00:12:42.600 --> 00:12:43.650
Even taking a piss feels off.

00:12:44.360 --> 00:12:45.730
That's mental decline.

00:12:46.030 --> 00:12:47.220
You're the one declining.

00:12:47.840 --> 00:12:48.650
Just now,

00:12:49.240 --> 00:12:49.820
out of nowhere,

00:12:49.870 --> 00:12:51.010
I thought of my wife.

00:12:52.150 --> 00:12:52.940
Look,

00:12:53.000 --> 00:12:54.420
why did she pop into my head

00:12:55.360 --> 00:12:56.130
just now

00:12:56.200 --> 00:12:57.340
out of all time?

00:13:00.720 --> 00:13:01.250
Jiaqi.

00:13:03.270 --> 00:13:04.340
All jokes aside,

00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:07.340
if something like this happens again,

00:13:07.790 --> 00:13:08.770
you ought to be very careful.

00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:11.610
Anyone

00:13:12.200 --> 00:13:13.340
would hesitate

00:13:13.670 --> 00:13:14.610
when they see the money.

00:13:17.670 --> 00:13:19.300
But I know you wouldn't.

00:13:21.750 --> 00:13:23.060
Our family is dragging you back.

00:13:29.240 --> 00:13:29.820
I'm the one

00:13:30.960 --> 00:13:31.820
dragging you back even more.

00:13:35.390 --> 00:13:37.100
It's not your fault. This has nothing to do with you.

00:13:38.600 --> 00:13:38.850
Jiaqi,

00:13:39.150 --> 00:13:40.010
I share the blame too.

00:13:40.600 --> 00:13:41.220
But the investment

00:13:41.270 --> 00:13:42.980
in the script I mentioned is looking promising.

00:13:43.630 --> 00:13:45.010
Anyway, I'll work harder.

00:13:45.750 --> 00:13:47.010
I won't let you worry about me anymore.

00:13:51.790 --> 00:13:52.820
At our age,

00:13:53.720 --> 00:13:55.300
life and health

00:13:56.000 --> 00:13:57.100
can't take

00:13:57.150 --> 00:13:58.220
too much shock.

00:13:58.750 --> 00:13:59.700
Look at me,

00:14:00.440 --> 00:14:01.340
and you'll get it.

00:14:02.270 --> 00:14:03.980
If you lose this job,

00:14:04.960 --> 00:14:05.850
your mom

00:14:07.440 --> 00:14:09.250
won't have any hope left.

00:14:11.550 --> 00:14:12.490
You could say

00:14:12.550 --> 00:14:13.340
you dodged a bullet this time.

00:14:14.840 --> 00:14:15.940
You've got to thank that girl.

00:14:17.000 --> 00:14:18.010
Find a chance

00:14:18.910 --> 00:14:19.530
and thank her properly.

00:14:21.270 --> 00:14:22.820
You take all the good lines and the bad ones.

00:14:23.390 --> 00:14:24.610
I'm having a serious talk with your brother.

00:14:26.600 --> 00:14:27.220
Jiaqi,

00:14:28.080 --> 00:14:28.530
home

00:14:29.270 --> 00:14:30.130
is always home.

00:14:32.200 --> 00:14:32.940
It's fine

00:14:34.240 --> 00:14:34.980
if your thoughts

00:14:36.270 --> 00:14:37.220
wander once in a while.

00:14:38.320 --> 00:14:39.010
That's fine.

00:14:40.270 --> 00:14:40.850
But

00:14:41.270 --> 00:14:42.610
you can't cross the line.

00:14:42.840 --> 00:14:43.770
That's enough.

00:14:44.510 --> 00:14:45.340
You're getting carried away.

00:14:45.510 --> 00:14:46.490
No, that's true, Jiaqi.

00:14:46.600 --> 00:14:47.850
There's barely room at home anymore.

00:14:48.360 --> 00:14:49.850
If Junyi kicks you out,

00:14:49.960 --> 00:14:50.820
Uncle

00:14:51.120 --> 00:14:52.490
will have nowhere to go.

00:14:53.550 --> 00:14:55.100
Who are you taking shots at?

00:14:55.240 --> 00:14:55.730
What?

00:14:56.840 --> 00:14:57.250
Hey.

00:14:58.320 --> 00:14:59.060
Stand right there.

00:14:59.150 --> 00:14:59.820
Stand right there.

00:15:01.080 --> 00:15:01.530
Stay there.

00:15:09.720 --> 00:15:11.980
[Sen'an Pharma Zhou Yu'an: Buy me dinner.]

00:15:11.980 --> 00:15:14.700
[I'm Zhou Yu'an.]

00:15:41.150 --> 00:15:41.980
What do you want to eat?

00:15:44.870 --> 00:15:45.370
Something expensive.

00:16:52.320 --> 00:16:53.250
Why did you help me?

00:16:54.670 --> 00:16:55.820
I felt like it.

00:16:58.600 --> 00:17:00.010
You were panicking so badly.

00:17:00.120 --> 00:17:01.180
I acted on impulse.

00:17:02.870 --> 00:17:04.010
How did you notice?

00:17:05.590 --> 00:17:06.880
Your face when you opened the paper bag

00:17:06.880 --> 00:17:07.700
gave you away.

00:17:10.350 --> 00:17:11.810
It was so obvious as if you wanted everyone to know.

00:17:13.640 --> 00:17:14.380
You turned back,

00:17:14.400 --> 00:17:15.290
and our eyes met.

00:17:17.750 --> 00:17:19.180
And when I asked you to buy me dinner,

00:17:19.200 --> 00:17:20.420
you agreed right away.

00:17:21.030 --> 00:17:22.050
If you weren't guilty,

00:17:22.070 --> 00:17:23.290
why say yes?

00:17:35.880 --> 00:17:36.570
Thank you.

00:17:46.550 --> 00:17:47.900
A man who has an affair

00:17:47.920 --> 00:17:48.900
with his subordinate's wife.

00:17:49.400 --> 00:17:50.660
What credibility does he have?

00:17:51.750 --> 00:17:53.460
I can agree to your request.

00:17:54.200 --> 00:17:56.140
But you have to agree to mine.

00:17:58.200 --> 00:17:59.180
What do you want?

00:17:59.750 --> 00:18:01.010
Everyone in the office knows

00:18:01.030 --> 00:18:02.330
Pang Jian wants to bring me down.

00:18:03.030 --> 00:18:04.730
Jiang Jiaqi may not be ambitious,

00:18:04.960 --> 00:18:06.900
but he's turned into a ticking time bomb.

00:18:07.880 --> 00:18:09.700
I need you to take them both out.

00:18:09.720 --> 00:18:11.220
All I want is a six-month contract.

00:18:11.510 --> 00:18:13.090
Your request is worth more than this.

00:18:21.270 --> 00:18:22.860
I can fire you right now.

00:18:24.070 --> 00:18:25.490
You think you have a choice?

00:18:26.030 --> 00:18:27.140
Keep the phone.

00:18:27.640 --> 00:18:28.620
Fifty thousand per person.

00:18:33.680 --> 00:18:34.900
Does that work for you?

00:18:36.590 --> 00:18:37.770
Why should I trust you?

00:18:41.270 --> 00:18:42.220
I told you.

00:18:42.640 --> 00:18:43.530
You don't have a choice.

00:18:47.480 --> 00:18:48.730
Get the money ready.

00:18:50.200 --> 00:18:51.460
So now you're willing to take it?

00:18:54.440 --> 00:18:55.250
This is a deal

00:18:56.350 --> 00:18:57.180
we both agreed to.

00:19:40.480 --> 00:19:40.860
Hello?

00:19:41.640 --> 00:19:42.010
Hello?

00:19:43.110 --> 00:19:44.530
How did it go?

00:19:45.480 --> 00:19:46.250
You have to help him.

00:19:47.070 --> 00:19:47.810
We've confirmed it.

00:19:48.110 --> 00:19:49.220
He threw the gift cards away.

00:19:49.790 --> 00:19:50.490
Threw them away?

00:19:51.960 --> 00:19:52.490
Where?

00:19:52.590 --> 00:19:53.530
That's impossible.

00:19:54.030 --> 00:19:55.420
He kept saying he lost them.

00:19:56.000 --> 00:19:57.490
They were dumped in the office trash.

00:19:58.240 --> 00:19:59.010
A janitor found them today

00:19:59.110 --> 00:20:00.140
and handed them in.

00:20:00.550 --> 00:20:02.290
But he told me they were lost.

00:20:03.200 --> 00:20:03.940
Are you sure?

00:20:07.440 --> 00:20:08.290
He wouldn't lie to me.

00:20:10.750 --> 00:20:12.250
That's two hundred thousand worth of gift cards.

00:20:12.310 --> 00:20:13.330
He just threw them away?

00:20:14.160 --> 00:20:14.900
Would you believe that?

00:20:17.030 --> 00:20:18.170
When he came home last night,

00:20:18.170 --> 00:20:19.390
he was tense.

00:20:19.390 --> 00:20:20.660
He said he couldn't explain himself anymore.

00:20:22.160 --> 00:20:23.290
Doesn't that sound strange?

00:20:25.440 --> 00:20:26.050
You don't need to worry about it.

00:20:28.310 --> 00:20:28.900
Gu Chen.

00:20:31.350 --> 00:20:32.010
I hope

00:20:33.000 --> 00:20:33.940
what's between us

00:20:34.830 --> 00:20:35.290
doesn't affect

00:20:35.350 --> 00:20:36.620
his situation at work, okay?

00:21:04.240 --> 00:21:04.980
Keep the gift cards quiet

00:21:06.160 --> 00:21:06.940
for me.

00:21:09.000 --> 00:21:10.290
I don't want more trouble.

00:21:15.680 --> 00:21:17.220
Buy me meals for a month.

00:21:18.830 --> 00:21:19.290
Sorry.

00:21:20.480 --> 00:21:21.250
I can't do that.

00:21:22.550 --> 00:21:23.940
If people from the office see us,

00:21:24.270 --> 00:21:24.770
it won't look good.

00:21:24.960 --> 00:21:26.420
We can make sure no one sees us.

00:21:28.790 --> 00:21:29.810
Meeting in secret is even worse.

00:21:30.110 --> 00:21:30.770
What would that make us?

00:21:32.680 --> 00:21:33.570
Are you

00:21:33.590 --> 00:21:34.810
under some illusion about yourself?

00:21:35.830 --> 00:21:36.490
Do you really think

00:21:36.550 --> 00:21:37.980
I asked you to treat me to meals

00:21:38.030 --> 00:21:39.380
because I want to spend time with you?

00:21:43.590 --> 00:21:44.330
Then cash it out.

00:21:45.510 --> 00:21:46.250
I'll pay you.

00:21:46.960 --> 00:21:47.290
Good.

00:21:50.240 --> 00:21:51.660
Three months of your salary.

00:21:54.830 --> 00:21:55.490
Is that too much?

00:22:03.070 --> 00:22:03.530
Alright.

00:22:04.480 --> 00:22:05.730
But I can only pay in installments.

00:22:08.240 --> 00:22:09.220
Until it's paid off,

00:22:09.270 --> 00:22:10.330
treat me to meals

00:22:10.830 --> 00:22:11.490
for interest.

00:24:05.300 --> 00:24:06.940
[To Mr. Jiang Jiaqi]

00:24:07.180 --> 00:24:10.460
[To Ms. Wu Yijun]

00:24:41.240 --> 00:24:42.380
What's going on?

00:24:47.830 --> 00:24:48.490
It's all handled.

00:24:48.830 --> 00:24:49.250
Everything's fine now.

00:24:54.030 --> 00:24:55.010
How was it handled?

00:24:57.400 --> 00:24:58.090
The cards were found.

00:25:00.720 --> 00:25:01.620
How were they found?

00:25:06.070 --> 00:25:07.010
I'm asking you.

00:25:07.070 --> 00:25:08.330
How exactly were they found?

00:25:10.240 --> 00:25:11.330
Someone threw them away.

00:25:11.880 --> 00:25:13.380
A janitor found them in the trash.

00:25:15.110 --> 00:25:15.810
Then why did he say

00:25:16.270 --> 00:25:17.460
you were the one who threw them out?

00:25:27.440 --> 00:25:28.010
Who said that?

00:25:29.510 --> 00:25:30.730
Who told you I threw them away?

00:25:38.960 --> 00:25:40.380
I couldn't reach you during the day,

00:25:40.830 --> 00:25:42.380
so I called Gu Chen.

00:25:44.480 --> 00:25:45.980
Why did you call him?

00:25:49.030 --> 00:25:50.860
Last night, you told me

00:25:51.920 --> 00:25:53.330
a bag of gift cards was missing.

00:25:55.480 --> 00:25:56.380
Then today,

00:25:57.510 --> 00:25:59.090
I couldn't find you all day.

00:26:01.310 --> 00:26:02.660
If I didn't ask him, who else could I ask?

00:26:04.550 --> 00:26:05.380
Have you ever thought about

00:26:05.400 --> 00:26:06.940
how I got through today?
