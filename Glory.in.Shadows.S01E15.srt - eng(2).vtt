(Harmony Brings Prosperity)

00:01:37.230 --> 00:01:38.070
Wan'er?

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:39.710
Why are you here?

00:01:39.760 --> 00:01:41.070
Mother is chanting sutras.

00:01:41.350 --> 00:01:42.710
I rushed over with some food.

00:01:43.040 --> 00:01:43.950
You must be hungry.

00:01:50.950 --> 00:01:52.710
Sister-in-law, did Brother come?

00:01:56.560 --> 00:01:57.400
Sister-in-law,

00:01:57.680 --> 00:01:58.710
Brother treats you so well.

00:02:01.120 --> 00:02:01.960
Sister-in-law,

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:04.280
I believe you did not push Concubine Qin.

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:05.920
You couldn't possibly do such a thing.

00:02:06.480 --> 00:02:07.320
However,

00:02:07.790 --> 00:02:09.150
when did you get pregnant?

00:02:09.590 --> 00:02:10.680
You didn't tell me.

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:13.680
I only just found out.

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:17.870
Sister-in-law, I truly envy you.

00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:19.710
You and Brother love each other deeply

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:22.400
and you are going to have a child.

00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:25.280
You will also meet someone
who truly loves you.

00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:27.910
He will be good to you, too.

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:30.200
Will...

00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:34.080
Will I meet someone like that?

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:35.870
Yes,

00:02:36.520 --> 00:02:37.360
you will.

00:02:38.590 --> 00:02:39.470
You're such a good lady.

00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:41.910
Your future husband will cherish you.

00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:45.150
Sister-in-law,

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:47.870
seeing you and Brother loving each other

00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:49.030
makes me truly happy.

00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:51.520
I think you should go back now

00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:52.640
before anyone notices.

00:02:53.240 --> 00:02:55.000
Old Madam will punish you
if she finds out.

00:02:56.470 --> 00:02:57.840
Take care, Sister-in-law.

00:03:00.630 --> 00:03:01.470
Be careful.

00:03:20.560 --> 00:03:21.400
Xiaocui,

00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:23.680
I want some water.

00:03:28.240 --> 00:03:29.080
What are you doing here?

00:03:30.360 --> 00:03:31.200
Yiyi,

00:03:31.800 --> 00:03:32.750
our child

00:03:33.310 --> 00:03:34.150
is gone?

00:03:34.360 --> 00:03:35.200
You should go!

00:03:35.800 --> 00:03:36.750
Here's the Li Manor!

00:03:37.080 --> 00:03:38.400
We'll be finished if they see you.

00:03:38.750 --> 00:03:39.590
Go!

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:40.910
I'm not leaving!

00:03:41.240 --> 00:03:42.710
What are you doing? Let go of me!

00:03:45.710 --> 00:03:47.520
I never expected that wretch Shen

00:03:47.590 --> 00:03:49.030
to be so hypocritical!

00:03:49.910 --> 00:03:51.360
She said she would spare us,

00:03:51.430 --> 00:03:53.520
but she harmed our child instead.

00:03:54.280 --> 00:03:55.430
How did you know about this?

00:03:55.870 --> 00:03:57.190
You don't need to worry about that.

00:03:57.960 --> 00:03:59.470
I'm going to kill her right now

00:04:00.310 --> 00:04:02.000
to avenge our child!

00:04:02.870 --> 00:04:03.710
Stop!

00:04:04.240 --> 00:04:06.120
Do you want this to be known to everyone?

00:04:06.870 --> 00:04:07.910
Do you want to ruin me?

00:04:08.910 --> 00:04:09.750
Yiyi,

00:04:12.710 --> 00:04:13.870
I'll take you away, alright?

00:04:14.910 --> 00:04:16.160
Let's get out of here.

00:04:16.800 --> 00:04:19.240
We can still have another child.

00:04:23.360 --> 00:04:24.200
Kong Liang,

00:04:25.920 --> 00:04:27.070
wake up.

00:04:28.510 --> 00:04:30.070
How could I possibly go with you?

00:04:31.510 --> 00:04:32.360
I...

00:04:32.390 --> 00:04:33.950
Though we fell in love in our youth,

00:04:34.390 --> 00:04:35.870
you are penniless

00:04:36.310 --> 00:04:37.510
and have no official rank.

00:04:38.830 --> 00:04:40.270
Should I accept begging for a living?

00:04:40.830 --> 00:04:41.830
That's not true.

00:04:42.140 --> 00:04:42.990
You told me that as I

00:04:42.990 --> 00:04:43.870
pass the exams...

00:04:43.880 --> 00:04:45.040
So what if you pass the exams?

00:04:46.270 --> 00:04:47.360
How many years would it take

00:04:48.040 --> 00:04:49.800
to rival the wealth and honor I enjoy now?

00:04:52.720 --> 00:04:54.720
I will not forsake a life of comfort

00:04:55.720 --> 00:04:56.800
to suffer with you.

00:04:57.870 --> 00:04:58.980
So, you never planned

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:00.480
to leave with me, did you?

00:05:01.120 --> 00:05:01.960
Yes,

00:05:02.920 --> 00:05:04.720
I just wanted you to stop pestering me.

00:05:05.560 --> 00:05:06.480
Did you hear me clearly?

00:05:08.190 --> 00:05:09.120
Now hurry up and...

00:05:10.560 --> 00:05:11.400
Get lost!

00:05:14.560 --> 00:05:15.400
But...

00:05:15.800 --> 00:05:17.720
We had a child.

00:05:23.390 --> 00:05:25.190
(I am carrying his child.)

00:05:26.240 --> 00:05:27.240
(If anyone finds out...)

00:05:33.240 --> 00:05:34.160
What are you doing here?

00:05:37.190 --> 00:05:38.120
She was right.

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:42.600
My child must die.

00:05:45.720 --> 00:05:46.600
She?

00:05:48.830 --> 00:05:49.800
Who is she?

00:05:52.190 --> 00:05:53.070
None of your business.

00:05:53.560 --> 00:05:55.190
So, you killed our child

00:05:55.190 --> 00:05:57.190
with your own hands, didn't you?

00:05:57.390 --> 00:05:58.230
Yes, I did!

00:05:59.160 --> 00:06:00.000
Kong Liang,

00:06:01.390 --> 00:06:02.630
you're just a commoner!

00:06:03.040 --> 00:06:04.120
Sharing a few nights with me

00:06:04.240 --> 00:06:05.800
was already more than you deserved!

00:06:06.190 --> 00:06:08.190
You want me to bear you a child?

00:06:10.160 --> 00:06:11.000
Dream on.

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:13.040
Qin Ruoyi,

00:06:14.510 --> 00:06:16.920
for your own wealth and glory,

00:06:17.720 --> 00:06:19.560
you can even kill your child?

00:06:21.040 --> 00:06:23.190
I never knew you were so vicious!

00:06:24.920 --> 00:06:26.680
You can only blame yourself
for misjudgement.

00:06:28.190 --> 00:06:29.310
That's all I need to say.

00:06:29.830 --> 00:06:31.040
You'd better leave now.

00:06:31.680 --> 00:06:32.520
Otherwise,

00:06:34.800 --> 00:06:36.750
I'll have you arrested as a thief.

00:06:42.390 --> 00:06:43.630
Qin Ruoyi,

00:06:44.560 --> 00:06:46.120
you can humiliate me all you want,

00:06:46.270 --> 00:06:47.870
but the child was innocent.

00:06:49.950 --> 00:06:51.360
How can someone so vicious

00:06:51.510 --> 00:06:53.190
deserve to live in this world?

00:06:55.240 --> 00:06:56.430
I will kill you and send you

00:06:57.000 --> 00:06:59.040
to follow our child to the grave!

00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:04.920
Let go of me!

00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:06.510
I will kill this evil woman!

00:07:08.800 --> 00:07:09.680
What are you doing here?

00:07:23.160 --> 00:07:24.880
Old Madam, General,

00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:25.840
this man...

00:07:26.070 --> 00:07:27.430
This man tried to assault me.

00:07:27.630 --> 00:07:28.560
General, help!

00:07:28.950 --> 00:07:29.790
General!

00:07:34.310 --> 00:07:35.240
It was you.

00:07:36.630 --> 00:07:38.390
You lured him here, didn't you?

00:07:39.070 --> 00:07:40.310
Yes, I copied your handwriting

00:07:40.430 --> 00:07:41.430
and wrote him a letter.

00:07:42.510 --> 00:07:43.430
Do you think he could

00:07:43.560 --> 00:07:44.720
just walk in here,

00:07:45.430 --> 00:07:47.040
in the marquis manor?

00:07:47.750 --> 00:07:48.590
General...

00:07:49.430 --> 00:07:50.270
General...

00:07:50.680 --> 00:07:52.070
Did you hear that, General?

00:07:52.240 --> 00:07:54.870
Shen Yaochu tried to set me up!

00:07:55.390 --> 00:07:56.750
Did she set you up,

00:07:57.000 --> 00:07:58.270
or did you set her up?

00:07:58.430 --> 00:07:59.270
General...

00:07:59.430 --> 00:08:01.680
Don't take her word for it alone.

00:08:02.190 --> 00:08:03.030
It was her!

00:08:03.390 --> 00:08:05.190
She killed our child,

00:08:05.950 --> 00:08:06.790
General.

00:08:09.190 --> 00:08:10.190
But at that night,

00:08:10.680 --> 00:08:11.870
I never even touched you.

00:08:19.800 --> 00:08:20.950
Old Madam, did you

00:08:21.360 --> 00:08:22.830
hear their conversation clearly?

00:08:27.800 --> 00:08:28.680
Old Madam...

00:08:29.800 --> 00:08:31.920
Please spare my life, I'm begging you.

00:08:32.440 --> 00:08:34.750
I've always been loyal to you,

00:08:34.870 --> 00:08:35.750
Old Madam!

00:08:37.360 --> 00:08:39.080
How dare you commit adultery

00:08:39.840 --> 00:08:41.200
and sully the Li family bloodline!

00:08:41.960 --> 00:08:42.800
Guards!

00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:44.270
Drag her out and beat her to death!

00:08:44.720 --> 00:08:46.750
Old Madam, please don't!

00:08:47.200 --> 00:08:48.040
Old Madam,

00:08:48.360 --> 00:08:49.750
please have mercy!

00:08:49.750 --> 00:08:51.000
Please spare my life!

00:08:51.150 --> 00:08:52.790
Heaven watches!

00:08:53.120 --> 00:08:54.030
Who knew your reckoning

00:08:54.480 --> 00:08:56.910
would be so sudden, you wretch?

00:09:00.390 --> 00:09:01.270
Wan'er.

00:09:01.360 --> 00:09:03.270
Wan'er, please speak for me.

00:09:03.280 --> 00:09:04.130
Wan'er,

00:09:04.150 --> 00:09:05.550
please help me.

00:09:05.750 --> 00:09:07.270
- Please save me!
- Mother,

00:09:07.670 --> 00:09:09.150
Concubine Qin did commit a grave wrong,

00:09:09.240 --> 00:09:11.000
but she's a human being.

00:09:11.360 --> 00:09:13.150
Please spare her life, Mother.

00:09:13.320 --> 00:09:14.360
Drive her out of the Li Manor

00:09:14.630 --> 00:09:15.550
as punishment.

00:09:15.870 --> 00:09:18.320
Wan'er, this is not your concern.

00:09:18.960 --> 00:09:21.270
Mother, we practice Buddhism every day,

00:09:21.670 --> 00:09:24.910
and we know that saving a life
brings boundless merit.

00:09:26.630 --> 00:09:27.470
Mother,

00:09:28.080 --> 00:09:29.870
for the sake of the Buddha,

00:09:30.200 --> 00:09:31.600
please spare Concubine Qin's life.

00:09:34.120 --> 00:09:36.030
Qin's conduct is corrupt

00:09:36.200 --> 00:09:37.440
and framed Her Ladyship.

00:09:38.630 --> 00:09:39.470
Shen,

00:09:40.320 --> 00:09:41.440
she is yours to decide.

00:09:43.150 --> 00:09:43.990
Yes.

00:09:48.440 --> 00:09:49.280
Wan'er,

00:09:49.440 --> 00:09:50.670
do you truly plead for her?

00:09:51.720 --> 00:09:52.560
Sister-in-law,

00:09:53.240 --> 00:09:54.790
I cannot bear to take a life.

00:09:56.440 --> 00:09:58.550
Not everyone can be redeemed by kindness.

00:09:59.200 --> 00:10:00.040
Sister-in-law,

00:10:00.360 --> 00:10:01.790
you just conceived Brother's child.

00:10:02.510 --> 00:10:04.360
I know your heart couldn't bear it either.

00:10:04.840 --> 00:10:05.680
Moreover,

00:10:06.120 --> 00:10:07.360
she's a human being.

00:10:11.630 --> 00:10:13.120
Alright, I'll spare her life.

00:10:15.320 --> 00:10:16.240
Send her to the estate

00:10:17.120 --> 00:10:18.630
outside the city at dawn,

00:10:19.320 --> 00:10:20.440
so she cannot spread rumors

00:10:20.790 --> 00:10:22.120
and damage the Lis' reputation.

00:10:24.150 --> 00:10:25.080
As for this man...

00:10:30.120 --> 00:10:31.030
Send him to his hometown.

00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:32.840
Yes.

00:10:34.030 --> 00:10:34.870
Go!

00:10:36.320 --> 00:10:37.160
Go!

00:10:39.320 --> 00:10:40.160
Wan'er.

00:10:43.550 --> 00:10:44.790
You are far too kind.

00:10:45.670 --> 00:10:46.510
Wan'er,

00:10:46.750 --> 00:10:47.600
with your temperament,

00:10:47.960 --> 00:10:49.200
you'll be easy prey.

00:10:49.440 --> 00:10:50.390
No matter what,

00:10:50.600 --> 00:10:51.910
she's a human being.

00:11:11.030 --> 00:11:12.320
Concubine Tang, you...

00:11:12.630 --> 00:11:13.470
You...

00:11:13.840 --> 00:11:14.680
I didn't.

00:11:14.910 --> 00:11:17.030
(Qifang Pavilion)
Concubine Tang killed!

00:11:17.750 --> 00:11:18.590
I didn't.

00:11:19.790 --> 00:11:20.630
General, Your Ladyship.

00:11:23.440 --> 00:11:24.280
Yuzhu,

00:11:24.440 --> 00:11:25.280
you...

00:11:25.960 --> 00:11:27.080
Your Ladyship, I didn't do it.

00:11:27.360 --> 00:11:28.600
I didn't. I don't know.

00:11:29.200 --> 00:11:30.360
Go, and speak not a word.

00:11:30.630 --> 00:11:31.470
Yes.

00:11:32.790 --> 00:11:33.670
It's Fan Scorpion Poison.

00:11:35.750 --> 00:11:37.030
Yes, indeed.

00:11:39.870 --> 00:11:41.390
What poison? I don't know.

00:11:41.750 --> 00:11:42.670
I didn't poison her.

00:11:43.120 --> 00:11:43.960
Calm down.

00:11:44.360 --> 00:11:45.360
Tell me, why are you here?

00:11:46.030 --> 00:11:46.870
I...

00:11:47.480 --> 00:11:48.750
I couldn't sleep last night.

00:11:49.240 --> 00:11:50.600
Thinking Concubine Qin

00:11:50.750 --> 00:11:51.910
would be driven out tomorrow,

00:11:52.120 --> 00:11:53.360
I went to make fun of her.

00:11:53.960 --> 00:11:55.150
But the moment I reached

00:11:55.320 --> 00:11:57.600
her bedside, I was knocked out.

00:11:58.390 --> 00:11:59.230
When I came to,

00:11:59.960 --> 00:12:02.480
I found myself holding this dagger.

00:12:03.240 --> 00:12:04.240
I... I really don't know.

00:12:04.440 --> 00:12:05.480
I have no reason to kill her.

00:12:05.670 --> 00:12:06.670
She would be driven out.

00:12:06.870 --> 00:12:08.120
Why would I kill her?

00:12:09.080 --> 00:12:09.920
Unless

00:12:10.870 --> 00:12:12.600
there was a reason she had to die.

00:12:13.720 --> 00:12:14.750
Since that's the case,

00:12:16.390 --> 00:12:18.750
the murderer can only be Tang Yuzhu.
