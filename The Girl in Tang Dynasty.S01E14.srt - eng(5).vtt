00:01:57.880 --> 00:01:59.160
Lunch time

00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:04.600
Lecher

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:09.360
What's wrong? Are you not feeling well?

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:14.240
Come on.

00:02:16.079 --> 00:02:16.640
Here.

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:22.360
What's wrong?

00:02:23.960 --> 00:02:25.760
Are you okay? I'm fine. I'm fine.

00:02:31.960 --> 00:02:32.520
My liver.

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:33.160
[Liver]

00:02:33.960 --> 00:02:35.240
Okay. Okay.

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:37.360
It hurts everywhere.

00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:39.640
But besides covering your heart,

00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:41.920
other organs are not there.

00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:45.800
It doesn't matter

00:02:46.320 --> 00:02:49.050
What's important is that I'm in pain everywhere.

00:02:49.079 --> 00:02:52.320
Am I dying?

00:02:59.800 --> 00:03:01.120
You...

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:03.770
You know how to treat patients?

00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:05.560
I've been a soldier since I was a kid.

00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:06.680
There are many soldiers in the army.

00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:07.640
and there are not enough soldiers.

00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:08.480
So I

00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:11.520
I've been learning medicine from the military doctor since I was a kid.

00:03:11.520 --> 00:03:12.320
Don't talk.

00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:15.080
Let me see what's wrong with you.

00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:17.960
Well...

00:03:18.240 --> 00:03:21.560
They said it's hard to get a pulse.

00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:23.760
My disease is aching everywhere.

00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:25.620
It must be a complicated disease.

00:03:26.200 --> 00:03:27.800
I know what disease you have.

00:03:29.240 --> 00:03:30.640
Your internal depression

00:03:30.640 --> 00:03:32.100
My heart is not going well.

00:03:32.560 --> 00:03:35.079
You're just anxious.

00:03:36.079 --> 00:03:37.240
Exactly.

00:03:38.200 --> 00:03:40.360
I'm locked up here every day.

00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:42.540
I need to go out for some fresh air.

00:03:44.960 --> 00:03:47.640
Someone, bring my silver needle.

00:04:07.960 --> 00:04:10.960
Don't worry. I'll be fine after a few hundred stitches.

00:04:10.960 --> 00:04:11.960
So many needles.

00:04:12.360 --> 00:04:13.040
Look.

00:04:13.400 --> 00:04:16.079
Just put the needle on the fire.

00:04:16.640 --> 00:04:18.200
When it's hot,

00:04:18.680 --> 00:04:19.740
Take this strength

00:04:19.880 --> 00:04:22.000
deep

00:04:22.360 --> 00:04:24.360
into the acupoints on your head.

00:04:24.680 --> 00:04:25.640
It'll be cured.

00:04:29.520 --> 00:04:31.440
It suddenly feels good.

00:04:32.080 --> 00:04:34.120
Do you think I'm very energetic?

00:04:35.200 --> 00:04:36.440
Do you need needles?

00:04:37.880 --> 00:04:38.680
No, no, no.

00:04:38.960 --> 00:04:40.200
I don't feel like eating.

00:04:40.200 --> 00:04:41.400
everything is great.

00:04:41.800 --> 00:04:44.440
Room No.1 is a perfect place.

00:04:47.080 --> 00:04:49.640
I'll turn upside down if I stay for two more days.

00:04:49.640 --> 00:04:50.760
Do you still need needles?

00:04:50.760 --> 00:04:51.360
No.

00:04:51.880 --> 00:04:52.440
Really?

00:04:52.680 --> 00:04:53.440
Shall we eat?

00:04:54.360 --> 00:04:54.880
Yes.

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:55.880
Are you sure?

00:04:56.200 --> 00:04:56.960
No.

00:04:58.960 --> 00:04:59.640
What a pity.

00:05:00.760 --> 00:05:02.080
No, no, no.

00:05:02.120 --> 00:05:03.380
I won't prick anymore.

00:05:07.200 --> 00:05:08.730
Learn how to flip your hand.

00:05:10.120 --> 00:05:11.000
Take care.

00:05:36.800 --> 00:05:39.520
Mr. Xu, you haven't eaten for a day.

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:41.200
He said he had no appetite.

00:05:41.200 --> 00:05:44.000
What if something goes wrong if you keep starving?

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:46.600
Hua Xiaochi, I heard you're on a hunger strike.

00:05:46.760 --> 00:05:48.760
I'll have appetite if you let me out.

00:06:03.960 --> 00:06:05.880
Xiao Zheng, hang in there.

00:06:06.440 --> 00:06:08.100
I'll starve for two more days.

00:06:08.200 --> 00:06:11.760
Just two days. Xu Ziqi will definitely let you out.

00:06:12.440 --> 00:06:13.320
Hang in there.

00:06:43.640 --> 00:06:44.640
It smells good.

00:06:49.640 --> 00:06:50.200
It smells good

00:06:50.200 --> 00:06:51.060
It smells good.

00:06:52.520 --> 00:06:53.320
Open the door.

00:07:09.200 --> 00:07:09.880
I'm hungry.

00:07:10.440 --> 00:07:11.440
I...

00:07:11.960 --> 00:07:13.020
I have no appetite.

00:07:13.160 --> 00:07:14.020
Then just wait.

00:07:15.960 --> 00:07:16.890
It's delicious.

00:07:17.440 --> 00:07:19.560
Don't mumble when you eat.

00:07:20.080 --> 00:07:20.680
Why?

00:07:21.760 --> 00:07:22.680
It looks

00:07:24.560 --> 00:07:26.680
Looks delicious

00:07:30.880 --> 00:07:32.409
I'm really good at cooking.

00:07:32.680 --> 00:07:34.080
Didn't you eat it before?

00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:38.200
It's good. It's delicious.

00:07:40.240 --> 00:07:42.000
You eat so many dishes alone.

00:07:42.680 --> 00:07:43.810
Can you finish them?

00:07:44.760 --> 00:07:47.020
Just throw it away if you can't finish it.

00:07:56.800 --> 00:07:58.360
Why not...

00:07:59.120 --> 00:07:59.560
Yeah.

00:07:59.560 --> 00:08:00.800
Why don't we share it with everyone?

00:08:00.800 --> 00:08:01.600
Come on, guys.

00:08:02.880 --> 00:08:03.680
Coming.

00:08:10.440 --> 00:08:11.080
Come on.

00:08:11.680 --> 00:08:12.520
Eat slowly.

00:08:13.520 --> 00:08:14.180
Be careful.

00:08:14.320 --> 00:08:16.050
Everyone has it. Don't grab it.

00:08:16.240 --> 00:08:17.240
Take more of this.

00:08:17.880 --> 00:08:18.240
Here.

00:08:20.320 --> 00:08:21.580
There's another dish.

00:08:21.760 --> 00:08:22.880
There's shrimp here.

00:08:22.880 --> 00:08:24.640
Celery cabbage

00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:25.800
Radish

00:08:26.560 --> 00:08:29.120
I want to steam rice with milk

00:08:29.320 --> 00:08:31.760
But these are all dishes that can't stay overnight

00:08:31.760 --> 00:08:33.880
It's a waste if you don't eat them.

00:08:34.440 --> 00:08:35.400
Forget it.

00:08:35.720 --> 00:08:37.440
I...

00:08:37.440 --> 00:08:37.960
Eat.

00:08:39.960 --> 00:08:40.799
Eat it.

00:08:42.799 --> 00:08:43.600
I'll eat it.

00:08:47.320 --> 00:08:48.680
I'll eat it, okay?

00:08:50.480 --> 00:08:51.720
But I'm tired now.

00:08:53.200 --> 00:08:54.800
I don't want to do it anymore.

00:08:56.320 --> 00:08:58.560
Didn't you say it's a waste not to fry it?

00:08:58.800 --> 00:08:59.960
You liar!

00:09:01.840 --> 00:09:03.680
Stir-fry. Right away.

00:09:04.080 --> 00:09:05.210
It'll be ready soon.

00:09:14.440 --> 00:09:15.720
What are these?

00:09:16.920 --> 00:09:17.780
Anything else?

00:09:17.920 --> 00:09:19.200
One dish is not enough.

00:09:19.440 --> 00:09:20.720
I left three dishes for you.

00:09:20.720 --> 00:09:22.120
There are crab meat balls

00:09:22.280 --> 00:09:24.280
and mushroom soup with abalone sauce.

00:09:24.280 --> 00:09:25.680
And dumplings with spinach.

00:09:25.680 --> 00:09:27.410
I'll cook another dish for you.

00:10:04.560 --> 00:10:05.840
Hua Xiao Zheng.

00:10:07.080 --> 00:10:09.800
You loser.

00:10:11.560 --> 00:10:14.160
You ate all the dishes.

00:10:14.280 --> 00:10:16.840
and ordered three meals a day.

00:10:19.480 --> 00:10:21.280
I can't get out now.

00:10:26.080 --> 00:10:29.680
Xu Ziqi is really good at cooking.

00:10:30.440 --> 00:10:31.800
No, Hua Xiaochi.

00:10:32.200 --> 00:10:33.080
Don't give in.

00:10:33.840 --> 00:10:35.700
Why don't we order some mapo tofu?

00:10:35.960 --> 00:10:38.040
Hua Xiaochi, wake up.

00:10:41.960 --> 00:10:43.080
Instead of this,

00:10:43.960 --> 00:10:45.760
It's better to have a short pain.

00:10:46.320 --> 00:10:48.120
I might as well just kill myself.

00:10:48.200 --> 00:10:50.480
We can send a doctor in tomorrow.

00:10:50.800 --> 00:10:52.080
Then I can escape.

00:10:54.040 --> 00:10:54.800
Yes.

00:11:22.960 --> 00:11:23.820
It's a bit hard.

00:11:26.600 --> 00:11:27.440
Come on.

00:11:33.920 --> 00:11:35.680
Three.

00:11:45.200 --> 00:11:45.680
You...

00:11:45.920 --> 00:11:46.320
You...

00:11:46.440 --> 00:11:47.560
Why are you awake?

00:11:48.560 --> 00:11:49.960
Are you having insomnia?

00:11:50.080 --> 00:11:52.600
Why is the wall so soft?

00:11:53.480 --> 00:11:54.160
You...

00:11:55.160 --> 00:11:56.400
Sorry to wake you up.

00:11:56.560 --> 00:11:57.800
I'll be gentle next time.

00:11:57.800 --> 00:12:00.080
Next time?

00:12:00.680 --> 00:12:02.680
How dare you try to kill yourself

00:12:02.680 --> 00:12:04.040
after the swing last time?

00:12:04.040 --> 00:12:05.600
Then don't lock me up.

00:12:05.920 --> 00:12:06.980
I'm locking you up.

00:12:07.560 --> 00:12:09.320
I locked you to protect you.

00:12:09.720 --> 00:12:11.440
What if I was too late?

00:12:11.680 --> 00:12:13.280
What if I came in late?

00:12:13.680 --> 00:12:14.440
Do you know

00:12:14.440 --> 00:12:15.960
if you hit your head?

00:12:16.200 --> 00:12:17.720
What if I didn't hug you?

00:12:19.960 --> 00:12:21.290
Are you out of your mind?

00:12:29.800 --> 00:12:30.560
Xu Ziqi.

00:12:31.160 --> 00:12:31.720
You...

00:12:33.080 --> 00:12:34.140
What are you doing?

00:12:43.080 --> 00:12:45.340
If you kill yourself again, I'll hug you.

00:12:45.560 --> 00:12:47.200
You're holding me too tight.

00:12:48.160 --> 00:12:48.960
Be quiet.

00:12:49.600 --> 00:12:50.440
Cut the crap.

00:12:53.400 --> 00:12:54.840
I ate too much.

00:12:55.080 --> 00:12:56.680
You're holding me too tight.

00:12:57.160 --> 00:12:58.800
I'll loosen it a little.

00:12:59.800 --> 00:13:01.330
But I still have to hold you.

00:13:01.680 --> 00:13:03.680
If you want me to let go, stay still.

00:13:03.800 --> 00:13:05.280
Let go of me!

00:13:05.280 --> 00:13:06.800
I will still crash into the wall.

00:13:06.800 --> 00:13:07.680
No way.

00:13:34.480 --> 00:13:35.410
Where is Xu Ziqi?

00:13:36.680 --> 00:13:38.320
Lord Xu has something to deal with.

00:13:38.320 --> 00:13:39.580
He'll be back tonight.

00:13:43.320 --> 00:13:44.080
Last night,

00:13:44.200 --> 00:13:45.160
did you hear

00:13:45.160 --> 00:13:46.320
fluttering?

00:13:47.040 --> 00:13:47.640
I heard it.

00:13:47.800 --> 00:13:49.330
It should be an earthquake.

00:13:49.560 --> 00:13:52.200
An earthquake? How could it be an earthquake?

00:13:52.440 --> 00:13:53.600
You have no idea.

00:13:53.840 --> 00:13:55.160
It has rhythm.

00:13:55.440 --> 00:13:56.680
I guess

00:13:57.440 --> 00:13:59.040
someone is playing the drum.

00:13:59.080 --> 00:13:59.680
Nonsense.

00:13:59.680 --> 00:14:00.280
Go.

00:14:00.680 --> 00:14:01.680
No way.

00:14:12.440 --> 00:14:13.600
This is our chance.

00:14:13.800 --> 00:14:15.060
The door is not locked.

00:14:30.720 --> 00:14:32.040
Why not?

00:14:32.440 --> 00:14:33.800
Isn't it you?

00:14:35.800 --> 00:14:36.960
At this point,

00:14:37.720 --> 00:14:39.720
you've defiled my innocence.

00:14:41.040 --> 00:14:43.800
I might as well kill myself.

00:14:43.960 --> 00:14:45.440
No, no, no.

00:14:45.680 --> 00:14:46.280
You...

00:14:46.720 --> 00:14:47.280
You...

00:14:47.960 --> 00:14:48.440
You...

00:14:48.440 --> 00:14:49.440
Jin'er!

00:14:51.560 --> 00:14:52.840
Take her out.

00:15:01.400 --> 00:15:02.200
Hero!

00:15:03.600 --> 00:15:05.280
All right.

00:15:05.840 --> 00:15:07.400
You useless people.

00:15:08.080 --> 00:15:09.880
If anyone lets her escape again,

00:15:10.440 --> 00:15:11.440
get in!

00:15:16.800 --> 00:15:17.660
Hua Xiao Zheng!

00:15:20.200 --> 00:15:21.480
I thought you ran out

00:15:21.960 --> 00:15:23.200
to find Li

00:15:23.200 --> 00:15:25.200
to discuss the matters of the Oiran.

00:15:25.600 --> 00:15:26.560
But you...

00:15:27.400 --> 00:15:29.400
You took off the hero's clothes.

00:15:29.400 --> 00:15:29.960
You...

00:15:29.960 --> 00:15:31.960
Is this why you escaped from prison?

00:15:35.440 --> 00:15:36.320
Tell me then.

00:15:36.680 --> 00:15:38.040
There are so many men in Chang'an.

00:15:38.040 --> 00:15:39.770
Who else do you want to take off?

00:15:40.960 --> 00:15:42.600
I've done everything I could.

00:15:42.600 --> 00:15:43.720
I dare not.

00:15:44.080 --> 00:15:44.920
I dare not.

00:15:48.440 --> 00:15:50.300
You can't do it even if you want to.

00:15:51.320 --> 00:15:52.850
Since the founding of Tang,

00:15:53.040 --> 00:15:55.280
you were the first woman who was imprisoned

00:15:55.280 --> 00:15:56.720
for harassing women.

00:15:57.720 --> 00:15:58.980
You can't go anywhere.

00:15:59.200 --> 00:16:00.680
Just stay here.

00:16:02.200 --> 00:16:03.260
Keep an eye on them.

00:16:03.480 --> 00:16:04.080
Yes.

00:16:16.680 --> 00:16:18.610
I'm here to take Hua Xiao Zheng out.

00:16:20.160 --> 00:16:21.600
Xu Ziqi, listen.

00:16:21.920 --> 00:16:22.580
What order?

00:16:28.720 --> 00:16:31.180
You also saw the authenticity of this order.

00:16:32.160 --> 00:16:34.160
Xu Ziqi, listen to me.

00:16:34.200 --> 00:16:36.160
But Hua Xiaochi has committed a crime.

00:16:36.160 --> 00:16:37.560
How can she just let it go?

00:16:37.600 --> 00:16:38.680
It says

00:16:39.080 --> 00:16:40.340
Release immediately.

00:16:55.560 --> 00:16:56.200
Li,

00:16:56.960 --> 00:16:58.220
It doesn't make sense.

00:16:59.480 --> 00:17:00.920
It's unreasonable

00:17:01.160 --> 00:17:02.360
to send him to prison.

00:17:02.440 --> 00:17:03.960
All right, Ziqi.

00:17:04.400 --> 00:17:06.280
Stop asking about the document.

00:17:07.839 --> 00:17:08.440
Li,

00:17:09.200 --> 00:17:11.280
This man can turn his hands over and turn his hands into rain.

00:17:11.280 --> 00:17:12.540
and free the criminal.

00:17:13.400 --> 00:17:15.060
Don't fall deeper and deeper.

00:17:15.400 --> 00:17:17.460
He is definitely not a simple person.

00:17:17.839 --> 00:17:20.770
Leave the business of the Chamber of Commerce alone.

00:17:24.760 --> 00:17:25.400
Zheng.

00:17:27.400 --> 00:17:29.440
I told you I would save you.

00:17:45.960 --> 00:17:47.920
Release hatred. Thank you.

00:17:48.200 --> 00:17:49.280
Thank you.

00:17:50.200 --> 00:17:52.660
How dare you take off another man's clothes?

00:17:55.280 --> 00:17:56.440
This...

00:17:58.200 --> 00:17:59.520
You knew?

00:17:59.720 --> 00:18:00.980
I know why you did that.

00:18:03.200 --> 00:18:04.280
You know?

00:18:04.440 --> 00:18:06.440
You peeled my clothes a few days ago.

00:18:06.760 --> 00:18:08.520
But I was too cold to you.

00:18:08.840 --> 00:18:11.040
That's why you provoked me in this way.

00:18:14.480 --> 00:18:16.440
You're really...

00:18:17.440 --> 00:18:19.280
You're so smart.

00:18:19.840 --> 00:18:20.520
So smart.

00:18:21.720 --> 00:18:22.920
I really want to do it.

00:18:23.120 --> 00:18:24.040
Just peel me.

00:18:28.720 --> 00:18:30.960
I didn't expect you to be so shy

00:18:31.480 --> 00:18:32.680
you would be so shy.

00:18:34.200 --> 00:18:34.840
Yes.

00:18:35.200 --> 00:18:36.840
Shy

00:18:42.040 --> 00:18:44.100
This is not the way back to the mansion

00:18:44.200 --> 00:18:45.120
It's so lively.

00:18:45.680 --> 00:18:46.120
This is...

00:18:46.120 --> 00:18:47.440
On the way to Pingkang Fang.

00:18:47.440 --> 00:18:50.440
The new Oiran touring street will be held in a few days.

00:18:50.480 --> 00:18:52.140
Your first public appearance

00:18:52.400 --> 00:18:53.460
is very important.

00:18:54.200 --> 00:18:55.800
You should practice harder.

00:18:56.400 --> 00:18:58.640
But you wasted two days in prison.

00:18:59.200 --> 00:19:01.000
There are only three days left.

00:19:02.240 --> 00:19:03.640
I've talked to Coach Xue.

00:19:04.280 --> 00:19:07.480
Learn from Xue Jiafang in the next three days.

00:19:07.640 --> 00:19:09.840
Rules of the Oiran roaming the streets.

00:19:10.200 --> 00:19:11.200
You must succeed.

00:19:12.120 --> 00:19:14.040
Teach me personally, Coach Xue.

00:19:15.400 --> 00:19:17.660
Professor Seol only provides the venue.

00:19:18.200 --> 00:19:19.120
Your people

00:19:19.280 --> 00:19:21.440
is the one who knows the Oiran best.

00:19:24.440 --> 00:19:25.760
Could it be...

00:19:41.160 --> 00:19:43.880
Why is there a physical punishment?

00:19:44.120 --> 00:19:44.600
You...

00:19:45.000 --> 00:19:46.040
Are you

00:19:46.600 --> 00:19:47.880
for personal revenge?

00:19:48.960 --> 00:19:50.240
Mr. Fang only said

00:19:50.240 --> 00:19:51.960
what the result is.

00:19:52.240 --> 00:19:54.600
I didn't say what kind of process it was.

00:19:55.240 --> 00:19:56.400
Stand still.

00:19:56.680 --> 00:19:57.960
Don't shrink.

00:19:58.640 --> 00:19:59.900
Straighten your back.

00:20:00.760 --> 00:20:01.920
Raise your head.

00:20:02.520 --> 00:20:05.240
Or I'll beat you.

00:20:20.200 --> 00:20:21.160
Hero,

00:20:21.520 --> 00:20:23.160
I was rude yesterday.

00:20:23.960 --> 00:20:24.840
I'm sorry.

00:20:27.160 --> 00:20:27.840
Jin'er.

00:20:28.440 --> 00:20:31.360
I thought your guideline was not thorny.

00:20:32.120 --> 00:20:32.960
I found you

00:20:32.960 --> 00:20:34.680
a thorn for you for ten years.

00:20:35.440 --> 00:20:36.680
I heard that

00:20:37.440 --> 00:20:39.170
no matter how thick the skin is,

00:20:39.440 --> 00:20:40.520
I can wear it

00:20:42.920 --> 00:20:43.600
Take it.

00:20:47.960 --> 00:20:48.720
What?

00:20:49.480 --> 00:20:51.160
Do you still want to fold it?

00:20:51.760 --> 00:20:52.840
How about this one?

00:20:53.520 --> 00:20:54.450
you break it too?

00:21:00.760 --> 00:21:02.160
Hold this jar

00:21:02.840 --> 00:21:03.880
Walk steadily.

00:21:04.440 --> 00:21:05.640
Don't move your head.

00:21:05.680 --> 00:21:06.940
Don't shake your body.

00:21:07.000 --> 00:21:08.060
Don't drop the jar.

00:21:08.200 --> 00:21:10.680
If you smash it, I'll hit you.

00:21:12.040 --> 00:21:13.440
This is too heavy.

00:21:14.280 --> 00:21:15.040
Be careful.

00:21:15.960 --> 00:21:18.520
This is only a few hundred years old antique.

00:21:18.920 --> 00:21:22.600
I'll smash it and compensate you with hundreds of taels of gold.

00:21:25.440 --> 00:21:26.240
I will

00:21:26.760 --> 00:21:27.720
walk well.

00:21:35.000 --> 00:21:36.040
Wait.

00:21:36.680 --> 00:21:38.040
Gu Gu! Gu Jin'er!

00:21:38.880 --> 00:21:40.040
Look.

00:21:40.040 --> 00:21:41.200
Look at my neck.

00:21:41.760 --> 00:21:43.160
Is it squeezed?

00:21:44.520 --> 00:21:45.360
Cut the crap.

00:21:46.160 --> 00:21:47.760
Keep the distance together.

00:21:48.720 --> 00:21:50.400
Move your hands naturally.

00:22:07.520 --> 00:22:08.280
Put it on.

00:22:14.200 --> 00:22:16.520
Are you sure it's not revenge?

00:22:17.640 --> 00:22:20.360
If Mr. Fang and the Chamber of Commerce hadn't forced me,

00:22:20.360 --> 00:22:21.760
I would have hit you.

00:22:23.960 --> 00:22:25.960
Who are you putting on a long face for?

00:22:25.960 --> 00:22:27.960
Do you think I want to torture you?

00:22:28.840 --> 00:22:31.680
These are what I got from the previous Oiran.

00:22:32.040 --> 00:22:35.040
That's how I was trained by Coach Xue.

00:22:35.680 --> 00:22:37.880
I was holding on

00:22:37.880 --> 00:22:39.720
was a real rock.

00:22:40.480 --> 00:22:41.440
fell down.

00:22:41.520 --> 00:22:43.240
My toes were smashed.

00:22:43.600 --> 00:22:45.640
This is nothing.

00:22:57.480 --> 00:22:58.640
I'm not aiming at you.

00:22:58.640 --> 00:23:00.770
It's not that I don't want to practice.

00:23:01.160 --> 00:23:02.560
I just don't understand.

00:23:04.040 --> 00:23:05.120
What?

00:23:06.200 --> 00:23:07.000
Gu Jin'er.

00:23:07.200 --> 00:23:09.440
You and I represent different people.

00:23:11.000 --> 00:23:12.530
Do you know what I'm saying?

00:23:14.360 --> 00:23:15.560
Something like that.

00:23:16.760 --> 00:23:17.600
Well,

00:23:18.440 --> 00:23:19.680
You're tall.

00:23:19.840 --> 00:23:21.000
I'm down-to-earth.

00:23:21.840 --> 00:23:24.500
We're not representing the same kind of people.

00:23:25.240 --> 00:23:26.440
I won,

00:23:26.760 --> 00:23:28.960
but I won the ticket of ordinary people.

00:23:28.960 --> 00:23:31.200
Last second I said I represent the people

00:23:31.200 --> 00:23:33.120
and wore gold and silver in the next second.

00:23:33.120 --> 00:23:34.680
Isn't this embarrassing?

00:23:35.360 --> 00:23:37.680
You're acting like a whore.

00:23:41.240 --> 00:23:41.840
I'm sorry.

00:23:42.160 --> 00:23:43.620
I didn't mean to scold you.

00:23:48.840 --> 00:23:49.640
Actually,

00:23:50.200 --> 00:23:51.680
I think you deserve

00:23:52.400 --> 00:23:54.040
you deserve it.

00:23:55.520 --> 00:23:56.640
Did I hear it right?

00:23:57.360 --> 00:23:58.600
Are you praising me?

00:23:59.840 --> 00:24:01.200
Although we're rivals,

00:24:01.680 --> 00:24:03.880
we can still talk openly.

00:24:05.240 --> 00:24:06.440
As the Oiran,

00:24:06.680 --> 00:24:08.920
I'm just a puppet.

00:24:09.440 --> 00:24:10.920
You have a soul.

00:24:12.160 --> 00:24:14.440
Actually, what you said on the final day

00:24:14.960 --> 00:24:16.000
I was convinced.

00:24:18.720 --> 00:24:21.600
I'm not used to the sudden compliment.

00:24:22.720 --> 00:24:24.280
Actually, I quite admire you.

00:24:24.280 --> 00:24:25.120
You're great.

00:24:25.440 --> 00:24:27.360
Look, you're an all-rounder.

00:24:27.600 --> 00:24:28.520
and beautiful.

00:24:28.960 --> 00:24:31.680
Look at me. I have everything.

00:24:31.920 --> 00:24:33.240
Except being smart,

00:24:33.600 --> 00:24:35.160
and a little cute.

00:24:37.240 --> 00:24:39.570
You don't have to compliment me politely.

00:24:39.720 --> 00:24:42.960
We'll be enemies for a long time.

00:24:43.760 --> 00:24:46.760
Why do you change your mind faster than turning a page?

00:24:47.280 --> 00:24:48.680
Make it clear.

00:24:48.680 --> 00:24:49.920
and less trouble.

00:24:51.200 --> 00:24:51.960
I hate

00:24:51.960 --> 00:24:54.200
the secret struggle in Pingkang Fang.

00:24:54.880 --> 00:24:56.040
Boring.

00:24:57.160 --> 00:24:59.240
I think you're an honest person.

00:25:00.200 --> 00:25:02.720
I don't have to be the Oiran anymore.

00:25:05.000 --> 00:25:05.840
And?

00:25:29.400 --> 00:25:31.680
You have to shut the door and talk.

00:25:33.000 --> 00:25:34.720
I want to redeem myself.

00:25:37.240 --> 00:25:38.040
And...

00:25:38.680 --> 00:25:40.680
I'm going after Mr. Bang, of course.

00:25:43.120 --> 00:25:43.920
But

00:25:44.440 --> 00:25:46.240
Zhang Gui is so nice to you.

00:25:48.120 --> 00:25:51.400
But Mr. Fang has been my dream for years.

00:25:51.640 --> 00:25:52.840
I have to get enough.

00:25:53.440 --> 00:25:55.520
You won't regret if you try hard.

00:25:56.840 --> 00:25:57.840
I support you.

00:26:00.040 --> 00:26:01.840
You support me chasing Mr. Fang.

00:26:04.200 --> 00:26:06.640
Aren't you

00:26:07.160 --> 00:26:08.200
with Mr. Fang?

00:26:10.960 --> 00:26:11.920
Well...

00:26:13.400 --> 00:26:14.200
I...

00:26:14.520 --> 00:26:15.920
You don't like Mr. Fang?

00:26:17.840 --> 00:26:19.200
It's a marriage matter.

00:26:19.760 --> 00:26:20.760
No kidding.

00:26:21.000 --> 00:26:22.400
I can't be casual either.

00:26:24.000 --> 00:26:26.200
I have to try my best.

00:26:26.680 --> 00:26:27.680
Then fight for it.

00:26:28.120 --> 00:26:29.960
Work hard, humble, grateful

00:26:30.240 --> 00:26:32.970
Keep fighting for your dream and you'll catch up.

00:26:36.920 --> 00:26:38.380
Do we know each other well?

00:26:38.760 --> 00:26:40.220
Why do I talk so much to you?

00:26:41.040 --> 00:26:42.880
I think we can be more familiar.

00:26:43.440 --> 00:26:45.900
Let's get along with the rival in love first.

00:26:46.240 --> 00:26:47.040
Step by step.

00:26:48.200 --> 00:26:48.960
Okay.

00:26:52.040 --> 00:26:52.640
No.

00:26:56.480 --> 00:26:57.280
I think

00:26:57.280 --> 00:26:59.000
let's deal with

00:26:59.000 --> 00:27:00.660
about your prostitute first.

00:27:00.680 --> 00:27:02.960
You have a point.

00:27:03.600 --> 00:27:05.280
you and I

00:27:05.520 --> 00:27:08.000
is not up to you and me.

00:27:08.680 --> 00:27:10.640
It's not up to you.

00:27:10.960 --> 00:27:12.960
It's up to the Chamber of Commerce.

00:27:13.640 --> 00:27:16.720
After all, you have to practice hard.

00:27:17.200 --> 00:27:19.720
Otherwise, all of us will suffer.

00:27:20.120 --> 00:27:21.240
You understand.

00:27:25.440 --> 00:27:26.240
What now?

00:27:31.440 --> 00:27:32.240
Jin'er.

00:27:32.920 --> 00:27:34.980
I'm afraid these glasses won't work.

00:27:35.920 --> 00:27:37.360
I went to the blacksmith's shop

00:27:37.360 --> 00:27:39.480
with a lot of money.

00:27:39.760 --> 00:27:40.640
a silver needle

00:27:41.600 --> 00:27:42.880
Invisible.

00:27:43.480 --> 00:27:44.960
It's more durable than a strip.

00:27:44.960 --> 00:27:46.840
That Young Master Ying...

00:27:47.280 --> 00:27:49.120
You don't have to hate me so much.

00:27:55.520 --> 00:27:56.120
Stab her.

00:28:43.520 --> 00:28:45.280
Isn't it pretty? It's not.

00:28:49.640 --> 00:28:50.840
This is not

00:28:50.960 --> 00:28:52.480
in a few days.

00:28:53.760 --> 00:28:55.200
If Miss Yun

00:28:55.200 --> 00:28:56.840
just sit in the Luan carriage,

00:28:56.840 --> 00:28:59.160
You can't show it in front of the car.

00:29:00.720 --> 00:29:01.880
I mean

00:29:02.160 --> 00:29:03.520
break her legs.

00:29:03.520 --> 00:29:04.120
No.

00:29:04.280 --> 00:29:05.340
That's a good idea.

00:29:10.120 --> 00:29:11.000
Or

00:29:11.000 --> 00:29:13.840
let the dancer dance around the crown tomorrow

00:29:13.920 --> 00:29:15.000
to cover her steps.

00:29:15.960 --> 00:29:16.520
I think

00:29:16.880 --> 00:29:18.440
we can come up with a better way.

00:29:18.440 --> 00:29:19.500
and think about it.

00:29:20.360 --> 00:29:21.620
I think this will work.

00:29:22.720 --> 00:29:23.780
Just do it this way.

00:29:23.960 --> 00:29:24.840
No.

00:29:24.840 --> 00:29:25.600
No no no

00:29:25.600 --> 00:29:26.600
Just do it like this.

00:29:26.600 --> 00:29:27.120
It's good.

00:29:27.120 --> 00:29:27.640
No.

00:29:27.640 --> 00:29:29.640
We need to think about something else.

00:29:29.640 --> 00:29:30.200
Yes. Yes.

00:29:30.360 --> 00:29:30.960
I agree.

00:29:31.760 --> 00:29:32.280
Okay. Let's go. Let's go.

00:29:32.280 --> 00:29:33.040
Think again.

00:29:38.440 --> 00:29:42.600
Why do I feel like I'm dying before I succeed?

00:29:42.600 --> 00:29:43.530
What should I do?

00:29:43.960 --> 00:29:46.440
There are so many people watching tomorrow.

00:29:47.680 --> 00:29:49.200
I'm sure we'll mess it up.

00:29:52.680 --> 00:29:54.610
Why didn't you take the front door?

00:29:55.880 --> 00:29:58.040
I'm afraid Li doesn't want to see me.

00:29:59.760 --> 00:30:01.680
I don’t want to see him now.

00:30:03.240 --> 00:30:05.600
If I knew it would be so hard for the Oiran to travel the streets,

00:30:05.600 --> 00:30:07.880
I would've stayed in prison.

00:30:08.440 --> 00:30:09.200
Indeed.

00:30:09.680 --> 00:30:10.960
When I was on the roof,

00:30:11.120 --> 00:30:12.400
when I was on the roof.

00:30:15.440 --> 00:30:16.920
You were like a butcher.

00:30:20.600 --> 00:30:21.960
I was so worried.

00:30:22.240 --> 00:30:23.520
How could you say that?

00:30:23.920 --> 00:30:25.360
Can't you comfort me?

00:30:26.120 --> 00:30:28.600
I'll be generous tomorrow.

00:30:29.280 --> 00:30:30.120
Well...

00:30:30.600 --> 00:30:31.930
Are you not mad anymore?

00:30:32.440 --> 00:30:33.900
If you're still stressed,

00:30:33.960 --> 00:30:36.000
you can hit me more.

00:30:42.400 --> 00:30:43.600
I just think

00:30:44.880 --> 00:30:46.440
I don't look like a Oiran.

00:30:49.680 --> 00:30:50.680
Look at you.

00:30:50.920 --> 00:30:52.280
When you were in prison,

00:30:52.280 --> 00:30:53.880
I told you to think carefully

00:30:53.920 --> 00:30:55.250
Why do you have to go out?

00:30:55.680 --> 00:30:57.140
I'm hesitant when I'm out.

00:30:57.880 --> 00:30:58.680
You

00:30:58.840 --> 00:31:00.900
Don't compare yourself to Gu Jin'er.

00:31:01.040 --> 00:31:02.440
You are you and she is her.

00:31:03.040 --> 00:31:05.120
Remember, even if you don't go shopping,

00:31:05.120 --> 00:31:06.580
you'll still be the Oiran.

00:31:06.960 --> 00:31:08.840
And most importantly,

00:31:09.440 --> 00:31:11.120
do you want to be yourself?

00:31:11.120 --> 00:31:12.240
in your heart?

00:31:17.040 --> 00:31:18.520
It's only been three days.

00:31:19.200 --> 00:31:20.680
You lost weight again.

00:31:23.600 --> 00:31:26.360
The food in Pingkang Fang is not good.

00:31:28.200 --> 00:31:31.440
I’ll find a chance to feed you.

00:31:49.640 --> 00:31:50.200
Hello.

00:31:52.440 --> 00:31:54.000
Hello

00:31:55.200 --> 00:31:55.720
Hello

00:32:27.120 --> 00:32:27.840
Hello.

00:32:43.160 --> 00:32:45.680
Your ex-sister-in-law is pretty.

00:32:48.960 --> 00:32:51.620
How many times have I told you not to call me that?

00:33:05.840 --> 00:33:07.000
Why is Chairman Bang

00:33:07.160 --> 00:33:08.760
Why are you kneeling alone?

00:33:08.960 --> 00:33:11.200
Mr. Bang will represent the Chamber of Commerce

00:33:11.200 --> 00:33:13.260
on behalf of the Chamber of Commerce.

00:33:15.480 --> 00:33:17.680
Isn't this the matter of the four Elders?

00:33:17.680 --> 00:33:19.200
Why did you let Chairman Bang kneel alone?

00:33:19.200 --> 00:33:20.480
I don't know.

00:33:20.480 --> 00:33:21.280
Miss Zheng

00:33:21.440 --> 00:33:22.600
Everyone is watching.

00:33:22.600 --> 00:33:24.060
Please continue to dance.

00:33:36.640 --> 00:33:39.120
Your Excellency, the new Oiran is not bad.

00:33:39.280 --> 00:33:41.160
She looks like a Oiran.

00:33:43.680 --> 00:33:46.440
Please teach me in the future.

00:33:47.880 --> 00:33:50.000
Of course, I will serve the court.

00:34:06.680 --> 00:34:07.480
So beautiful.

00:34:09.239 --> 00:34:12.440
Mr. Fang works so hard every year.

00:34:12.600 --> 00:34:14.000
I really admire him.

00:34:15.280 --> 00:34:16.600
He got to where he is today

00:34:16.600 --> 00:34:20.440
because of the favor of the Chamber of Commerce and the lords.

00:34:20.639 --> 00:34:22.880
so that he can pray for the people.

00:34:22.880 --> 00:34:24.560
He has to do his best.

00:34:36.480 --> 00:34:37.400
It's raining.

00:34:39.239 --> 00:34:40.440
The rain is too heavy.

00:34:44.880 --> 00:34:45.800
Let's go.

00:34:46.360 --> 00:34:46.960
Hurry!

00:34:51.400 --> 00:34:52.880
Stop the car!

00:34:59.480 --> 00:35:00.440
What are you doing?

00:35:00.440 --> 00:35:01.320
Leave me alone.

00:35:01.440 --> 00:35:02.440
Don't follow me.

00:35:02.920 --> 00:35:03.440
No.

00:35:11.840 --> 00:35:14.300
Xiao Zheng, hurry back to the Luan carriage.

00:35:14.880 --> 00:35:15.810
Go back quickly.

00:35:21.080 --> 00:35:22.360
Don't just block the rain.

00:35:22.360 --> 00:35:23.600
It works if you are sincere.

00:35:23.600 --> 00:35:26.000
The rain will be disrespectful to the gods.

00:35:26.720 --> 00:35:27.520
Go back

00:35:27.680 --> 00:35:29.010
The adults are watching

00:35:30.600 --> 00:35:31.440
Go back.

00:35:36.360 --> 00:35:37.400
Hua Xiaochi

00:35:37.480 --> 00:35:38.520
Good job.

00:35:40.000 --> 00:35:42.400
Didn't you say that praying on behalf of the Chamber of Commerce

00:35:42.400 --> 00:35:44.120
If you are sincere, it will work.

00:35:44.120 --> 00:35:46.240
I'm the Oiran of the Chamber of Commerce.

00:35:46.240 --> 00:35:48.080
I'll kneel down with you

00:35:48.080 --> 00:35:48.920
kneel down

00:35:49.600 --> 00:35:51.000
Isn't it more effective?

00:35:53.720 --> 00:35:54.320
Husppy

00:35:55.240 --> 00:35:56.320
I guess the people behind

00:35:56.320 --> 00:35:57.560
can't hear me.

00:35:58.560 --> 00:36:00.800
Pass my words to everyone louder.

00:36:02.600 --> 00:36:03.400
Go.

00:36:03.720 --> 00:36:04.240
Yes.

00:36:04.840 --> 00:36:05.960
Ms. Zheng said

00:36:06.240 --> 00:36:08.440
she wants to kneel down with her husband.

00:36:08.440 --> 00:36:09.700
to pray for the people.

00:36:30.720 --> 00:36:31.520
What's wrong?

00:36:31.800 --> 00:36:32.760
The dress is too heavy.

00:36:32.760 --> 00:36:33.720
This won't do.

00:36:34.400 --> 00:36:36.530
How long are we going to walk like this?

00:36:37.320 --> 00:36:39.180
Do you see the light pole in front?

00:36:42.240 --> 00:36:43.900
We're almost there. Let's go.

00:36:44.000 --> 00:36:45.260
Go through that tower.

00:36:45.320 --> 00:36:46.560
Ten more seats.

00:36:48.720 --> 00:36:50.580
Do you kneel like this every year?

00:36:50.640 --> 00:36:51.000
Yes.

00:36:53.280 --> 00:36:54.210
Come on. Come on.

00:36:55.920 --> 00:36:56.720
Kneel.

00:36:57.560 --> 00:36:58.820
Let's kneel together.

00:36:59.040 --> 00:36:59.970
What do you mean?

00:37:06.920 --> 00:37:07.440
Zheng.

00:37:07.720 --> 00:37:08.180
Xiao...

00:37:28.000 --> 00:37:29.080
Separate hatred.

00:37:30.640 --> 00:37:31.920
Hua Xiaochi

00:37:32.240 --> 00:37:34.280
My sincerity touched heaven and earth.

00:37:34.280 --> 00:37:37.880
I am a deity who descended to Chang'an.

00:37:38.040 --> 00:37:40.280
If all beings want me to protect you,

00:37:40.760 --> 00:37:43.440
I only need the four Elders to kneel before me.

00:37:44.080 --> 00:37:48.240
I will ensure the weather in Chang'an in a year.

00:37:48.240 --> 00:37:50.000
Okay.

00:37:55.760 --> 00:37:56.800
The deity has shown himself.

00:37:56.800 --> 00:37:57.960
The deity has shown himself.

00:37:57.960 --> 00:37:59.640
As long as the four Elders kneel before the deity,

00:37:59.640 --> 00:38:02.160
the weather in Chang'an will be smooth every year.

00:38:02.160 --> 00:38:03.960
That's right. You should kneel too.

00:38:03.960 --> 00:38:04.800
Kneel! Kneel!

00:38:04.880 --> 00:38:05.400
Kneel!

00:38:06.840 --> 00:38:09.240
The Heavenly Deity has shown his presence.

00:38:10.880 --> 00:38:13.480
Why aren't the four Elders kneeling?

00:38:20.800 --> 00:38:22.320
Is this true?

00:38:22.320 --> 00:38:23.560
Should we kneel or not?

00:38:23.560 --> 00:38:24.760
I'm afraid

00:38:25.320 --> 00:38:26.720
I'm afraid it's not true.

00:38:26.960 --> 00:38:27.760
I won't kneel.

00:38:28.960 --> 00:38:30.720
Let's wait and see.

00:38:33.440 --> 00:38:34.640
The deity has shown his presence.

00:38:34.640 --> 00:38:35.640
If you don't kneel,

00:38:35.640 --> 00:38:37.440
if Chang'an is not peaceful this year,

00:38:37.440 --> 00:38:38.840
you will all be beheaded.

00:38:48.160 --> 00:38:50.000
Why aren't you kneeling?

00:38:52.960 --> 00:38:54.360
What are you waiting for?

00:38:54.440 --> 00:38:55.520
Go kneel!

00:38:55.800 --> 00:38:56.160
That's right.

00:38:56.160 --> 00:38:57.120
Kneel!

00:39:00.040 --> 00:39:00.360
Hurry up!

00:39:00.360 --> 00:39:01.520
What are you waiting for? Drag him out.

00:39:01.520 --> 00:39:02.240
Hurry!

00:39:42.920 --> 00:39:43.580
Xiao Zheng.

00:39:44.040 --> 00:39:45.440
The elders are on their knees.

00:39:45.440 --> 00:39:46.040
Enough?

00:39:50.440 --> 00:39:50.920
Zheng!

00:39:54.240 --> 00:39:55.040
Wake up!

00:39:55.360 --> 00:39:56.490
Wake up, Xiao Zheng.

00:39:57.280 --> 00:39:58.560
If I wake up,

00:39:58.880 --> 00:40:00.400
if I wake up.

00:40:01.920 --> 00:40:04.800
Ask the doctor to take me away.

00:40:06.720 --> 00:40:07.380
Xiao Zheng!

00:40:07.440 --> 00:40:08.120
Zheng!

00:40:08.480 --> 00:40:09.240
Zheng!

00:40:09.520 --> 00:40:10.120
Doctor!

00:40:10.400 --> 00:40:10.880
Zheng.

00:40:10.880 --> 00:40:11.410
Hurry up.

00:40:11.560 --> 00:40:12.080
Doctor.

00:40:12.720 --> 00:40:13.380
Xiao Zheng.

00:40:14.080 --> 00:40:14.560
Zheng!

00:40:15.080 --> 00:40:16.010
Call the doctor.

00:40:16.480 --> 00:40:17.320
Zheng.

00:40:18.320 --> 00:40:18.720
Boss

00:40:18.800 --> 00:40:19.400
Doctor.

00:40:19.440 --> 00:40:21.240
Why don't you go and check on her?

00:40:21.360 --> 00:40:22.520
She passed out by lightning again.

00:40:22.520 --> 00:40:24.450
Xiao Zheng laughed so much just now

00:40:24.520 --> 00:40:25.360
I can't see it.

00:40:26.520 --> 00:40:30.560
You're so bad at acting

00:40:44.920 --> 00:40:46.400
That's enough

00:40:47.120 --> 00:40:49.320
I don't even kneel down.

00:40:50.880 --> 00:40:52.480
Go lie down.

00:40:53.080 --> 00:40:55.120
Keep kneeling.

00:41:01.480 --> 00:41:03.760
Why? Why do you make me kneel?

00:41:06.400 --> 00:41:06.920
Get up.

00:41:07.000 --> 00:41:07.480
Zheng.

00:41:07.880 --> 00:41:09.920
Why do you listen to what they say?

00:41:10.440 --> 00:41:12.040
We really did nothing wrong.

00:41:13.600 --> 00:41:15.130
What are you yelling about?

00:41:16.520 --> 00:41:17.520
I told you before.

00:41:18.080 --> 00:41:19.280
Mr. Bang

00:41:19.520 --> 00:41:21.000
And this bumpkin.

00:41:21.360 --> 00:41:23.000
They can't do anything well.

00:41:23.440 --> 00:41:26.700
Why should we choose them to be the president and the Oiran?

00:41:30.160 --> 00:41:30.960
Zheng!

00:41:31.960 --> 00:41:33.000
You bumpkin!

00:41:33.080 --> 00:41:33.640
Zheng.

00:41:33.840 --> 00:41:35.920
You know Ban Li resentment is the chairman of the Chamber of Commerce.

00:41:35.920 --> 00:41:37.440
How dare you do this to him?

00:41:37.560 --> 00:41:38.000
You...

00:41:38.040 --> 00:41:38.840
Zheng, get up.

00:41:41.720 --> 00:41:42.440
Get up.

00:41:42.720 --> 00:41:43.380
Xiao Zheng.

00:41:44.720 --> 00:41:45.320
Get up.

00:41:45.400 --> 00:41:47.480
Do you know who Separation is?

00:41:49.320 --> 00:41:50.840
For this woman,

00:41:51.080 --> 00:41:52.960
for this woman,

00:41:53.080 --> 00:41:54.960
and the relationship

00:41:55.160 --> 00:41:56.960
and the Chamber of Commerce.

00:41:58.400 --> 00:41:59.600
In public,

00:41:59.640 --> 00:42:01.170
Don't you know your status?

00:42:01.360 --> 00:42:02.720
You surrendered yourself.

00:42:02.720 --> 00:42:05.120
and become a couple

00:42:05.120 --> 00:42:06.240
in pairs.

00:42:10.760 --> 00:42:13.360
You still don't know who Separation is, do you?

00:42:13.840 --> 00:42:15.040
I believe except you,

00:42:15.040 --> 00:42:16.280
everyone in Chang'an

00:42:16.440 --> 00:42:17.840
many people

00:42:18.480 --> 00:42:21.360
don't know who Mr. Fang is.

00:42:30.720 --> 00:42:31.580
Have you heard?

00:42:31.640 --> 00:42:32.480
That house was a sinner

00:42:32.480 --> 00:42:34.940
was a sinner who entered the trade register.

00:42:35.080 --> 00:42:36.240
Business registration?

00:42:36.240 --> 00:42:37.840
Isn't that the lowest household register?

00:42:37.840 --> 00:42:39.700
Mr. Bang and Mr. Bang are calling.

00:42:40.040 --> 00:42:41.300
Yesterday, I found out

00:42:41.560 --> 00:42:44.440
the chairman of the Chamber of Commerce is the face of the Chamber of Commerce.

00:42:44.440 --> 00:42:45.570
When I chose a house,

00:42:45.600 --> 00:42:47.720
was because he liked the good appearance of the son.

00:42:47.720 --> 00:42:48.520
The president

00:42:48.640 --> 00:42:51.360
is not qualified to be in charge of any Chamber of Commerce.

00:42:51.360 --> 00:42:52.420
It's just a puppet.

00:42:53.480 --> 00:42:55.160
Mr. Fang, you made such a scene

00:42:55.360 --> 00:42:56.040
is a fool.

00:42:56.040 --> 00:42:56.600
Yes.

00:43:01.160 --> 00:43:01.960
Lord Xu.

00:43:02.640 --> 00:43:04.880
Who told you these?

00:43:05.280 --> 00:43:06.440
Please calm down, Lord Xu.

00:43:06.440 --> 00:43:08.280
We didn't make it up.

00:43:08.440 --> 00:43:09.800
The elders of the Chamber of Commerce

00:43:09.800 --> 00:43:11.920
in the tea house early in the morning.

00:43:12.040 --> 00:43:12.440
Yes.

00:43:12.440 --> 00:43:14.880
It's all over the place.

00:43:16.960 --> 00:43:18.040
It’s my fault

00:43:18.360 --> 00:43:19.720
is indeed my doing.

00:43:20.560 --> 00:43:21.440
Yes.

00:43:24.800 --> 00:43:26.480
Yes, I didn't expect that.

00:43:27.080 --> 00:43:28.440
It's a low class

00:43:28.640 --> 00:43:29.240
Yes.

00:43:38.480 --> 00:43:39.840
Who would have thought

00:43:39.840 --> 00:43:40.920
is a merchant.

00:43:41.040 --> 00:43:42.320
and a sinner.

00:43:42.640 --> 00:43:44.640
How can I raise my head when I go out?

00:43:45.000 --> 00:43:46.520
I'm too ashamed to face anyone.

00:43:46.520 --> 00:43:48.600
Why don't you quit and leave as soon as possible?

00:43:48.600 --> 00:43:49.400
That's right.

00:43:58.440 --> 00:44:00.040
Open the door! Open the door!

00:44:01.800 --> 00:44:03.400
Open the door! Open the door!

00:44:04.400 --> 00:44:05.460
Separating hatred

00:44:06.960 --> 00:44:07.800
Zheng.

00:44:15.280 --> 00:44:17.610
What's wrong? Still not opening the door?

00:44:18.120 --> 00:44:19.400
He has locked himself inside

00:44:19.400 --> 00:44:20.720
for more than two hours.

00:44:20.720 --> 00:44:21.850
He didn't say a word.

00:44:25.920 --> 00:44:27.380
What happened after that?

00:44:27.600 --> 00:44:28.800
So what?

00:44:29.760 --> 00:44:30.880
Is it that serious?

00:44:31.480 --> 00:44:33.720
I really don't understand the rules in Chang'an.

00:44:33.720 --> 00:44:34.520
After a sinner,

00:44:34.520 --> 00:44:36.080
I've been looked down upon.

00:44:36.440 --> 00:44:37.560
As for business registration,

00:44:37.560 --> 00:44:40.240
As the saying goes,

00:44:40.480 --> 00:44:41.440
is the last.

00:44:42.080 --> 00:44:44.140
People have always looked down on me.

00:44:47.520 --> 00:44:49.840
What a pity.

00:44:52.360 --> 00:44:53.240
Go back first.

00:44:53.520 --> 00:44:54.400
Leave him to me.

00:44:55.040 --> 00:44:55.720
But...

00:44:55.960 --> 00:44:56.720
No buts.

00:45:11.960 --> 00:45:12.720
Li.

00:45:13.280 --> 00:45:14.080
Open the door!

00:45:16.040 --> 00:45:16.800
Open the door!

00:45:16.800 --> 00:45:18.960
I'll kick you if you don't open the door.

00:45:18.960 --> 00:45:20.400
Three, two,
